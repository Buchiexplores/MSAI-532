they

the

he
suggested
kbr

he

he

from

it

the

three
states

massachusetts
california
and
connecticut

have
legalized
samesex
marriage
and
now
three
states
california
among
them
have
proposals
on
their
ballots
this
month
to
ban
gay
marriage
but
given
that
the
federal
government
views
samesex
married
couples
as
perfect
strangers
ineligible
for
the
many
federal
rights
given
to
oppositesex
married
couples
the
question
for
gay
couples
is
this
is
it
worth
it
to
tie
the
knot
for
many
couples
the
answer
is
a
resounding
yes
the
word
married
itself
instantly
conveys
something
that
civil
unions
and
domestic
partnerships
do
not
yet
purely
from
a
financial
perspective
its
hard
to
come
to
any
sweeping
conclusions
for
couples
living
in
states
that
offer
marriage
or
civil
unions

which
provide
many
of
the
same
rights
as
marriage

it
definitely
makes
sense
for
them
to
be
married
if
they
have
children
according
to
financial
planners
and
estate
planning
lawyers
those
who
make
their
relationship
official
may
pay
significantly
less
in
state
estate
taxes
they
will
also
gain
important
privileges
including
hospital
visitation
rights
and
the
ability
to
make
medical
decisions
for
a
partner
in
emergencies
still
the
many
rights
that
marriage
confers
vaporize
the
moment
couples
step
into
a
state
that
does
not
recognize
their
unions
it
is
a
tricky
path
to
navigate
given
the
patchwork
of
state
laws
and
varying
grades
of
benefits
they
provide
besides
the
three
states
that
allow
marriage

connecticut
made
it
legal
in
october

new
jersey
new
hampshire
and
vermont
allow
civil
unions
which
generally
approximate
marriage
oregon
provides
something
similar
but
calls
it
domestic
partnership
the
district
of
columbia
hawaii
maine
washington
and
other
jurisdictions
provide
certain
rights
under
domestic
partnership
laws
the
constant
state
of
flux
as
illustrated
by
this
years
ballot
makes
it
all
the
more
complicated
it
really
depends
on
where
you
are
standing
said
david
buckel
marriage
project
director
and
senior
counsel
at
lambda
legal
in
new
york
more
than
40
states
have
passed
statutes
to
confirm
that
samesex
couples
are
not
allowed
to
marry
there
are
also
certain
reasons
not
to
marry
it
could
ruin
your
chances
of
adopting
a
child
from
abroad
for
example
because
many
countries
do
not
allow
openly
gay
couples
to
adopt
many
couples
make
the
leap
even
knowing
their
legal
standing
will
not
be
equal
to
that
of
oppositesex
couples
jeff
friedman
and
andrew
zwerin
both
40
and
residents
of
rockville
centre
ny
decided
to
marry
as
soon
as
california
legalized
it
in
may
they
were
wed
in
palos
verdes
estates
calif
on
oct
12
their
new
status
means
they
can
qualify
for
lower
car
insurance
premiums
because
they
are
no
longer
considered
single
males
and
they
hope
their
marriage
will
give
them
more
legal
standing
if
their
son
joshua
5
lands
in
the
emergency
room
because
of
his
asthma
the
last
time
he
was
admitted
the
pediatric
nurse
told
the
two
dads
that
she
needed
to
speak
with
the
childs
mother
but
friedman
said
they
are
well
aware
that
their
marriage
carries
no
weight
when
it
comes
to
say
filing
their
federal
tax
return
though
they
can
file
a
joint
state
tax
return
which
will
allow
them
to
keep
more
of
their
earnings
and
the
marriage
certificate
is
flimsy
when
the
couple
leaves
new
york
which
honors
samesex
marriages
performed
elsewhere
on
family
vacations
the
pair
will
continue
to
bring
along
a
slightly
torn
manila
folder
stuffed
with
documentation

birth
certificates
health
care
proxies
powers
of
attorney
and
all
of
their
sons
adoption
records

that
proves
they
are
a
family
our
hope
is
that
also
providing
a
marriage
license
might
help
provide
additional
documentation
for
proof
of
how
we
are
all
related
friedman
said
i
want
to
make
sure
my
son
is
taken
care

something
were
to
happen
to
me
the
list
below
outlines
the
benefits
samesex
married
couples
and
those
with
civil
unions
generally
receive
as
well
as
what
they
still
need
to
be
concerned
about
these
issues
are
not
as
complicated
for
oppositesex
couples
because
they
receive
many
more
rights
when
they
marry
regardless
of
where
they
live
and
those
rights
are
broadly
recognized
medical
power
of
attorney
married
or
not
all
committed
samesex
couples
should
consider
a
power
of
attorney
for
health
care
or
medical
matters
which
appoints
a
person
to
make
medical
decisions
for
you
when
you
cannot
do
so
it
is
also
known
as
a
health
care
proxy
among
other
things
depending
on
where
you
live
the
document
should
include
an
authorization
under
the
health
insurance
portability
and
accountability
act
to
provide
access
to
medical
records
you
may
also
include
a
hospital
visitation
directive
to
specify
who
can
visit
you
in
the
hospital
another
important
document
is
a
living
will
which
specifies
which
medical
procedures
may
or
may
not
be
done
it
is
an
important
document
for
anyone
but
more
so
for
samesex
couples
because
we
could
have
family
members
come
in
and
say
no
i
know
better
and
this
person
has
absolutely
no
standing
said
james
tissot
a
new
york
financial
planner
durable
power
of
attorney
if
one
partner
becomes
incapacitated
a
durable
power
of
attorney
gives
the
other
partner
authority
to
handle
financial
and
legal
affairs
like
paying
bills
wills
and
trusts
being
married
in
a
state
that
recognizes
your
union
does
not
guarantee
that
all
your
assets
will
go
to
your
partner
this
goes
for
heterosexual
couples
as
well
a
will
directs
how
your
assets
will
be
distributed
after
you
die
and
allows
you
to
name
a
guardian
for
your
children
a
revocable
living
trust
on
the
other
hand
is
viewed
as
more
difficult
to
contest
than
a
will
and
it
avoids
the
sometimes
lengthy
and
expensive
legal
process
to
settle
a
deceased
persons
estate
with
a
revocable
living
trust
you
basically
put
all
your
assets
in
the
trust
and
the
trustee
you
name
distributes
them
according
to
your
directions
after
you
die
people
just
assume
they
dont
need
to
have
legal
documents
drafted
if
they
are
in
a
civil
union
or
a
marriage
and
that
is
an
entirely
wrong
assumption
said
debra
neiman
a
financial
planner
in
arlington
mass
retirement
since
samesex
married
couples
are
not
eligible
for
social
security
survivor
benefits
they
may
need
to
save
more
or
make
special
arrangements

like
purchasing
life
insurance

to
be
sure
the
survivor
has
enough
financial
resources
if
one
partner
should
die
for
instance
if
one
partner
is
a
stayathome
parent
that
partner
will
not
qualify
for
the

secondparent
adoption
your
marital
status
does
not
matter
here
if
only
one
spouse
is
the
birth
parent
it
is
best
to
conduct
a
secondparent
adoption
that
will
allow
both
parents
to
make
decisions
about
the
child
and
will
ensure
custody
in
the
event
that
one
parent
dies
as
well
as
parental
rights
should
the

split
adoption
will
also
give

disability
or
survivor
benefits
from
either
parent
if
you
live
in
a
state
where
you
cannot
get

your
nextbest
option
is
to
create
a

or

agreement
according
to

legal

samesex
spouses
are
subject
to
federal
gift
taxes
for
items
that
add
up
to
more
than
12000
annually
but
partners
married

rick
kraft
a
boston
estateplanning
lawyer
who
works
with
samesex
couples
recommends
a
joint
account
as
long
as
it
is
used
for
regular
household
expenses
and
not
extravagant
gifts
technically
if
one
partner
makes
a
big
deposit
in
a
shared
account
and
the
other
makes
a
big
withdrawal
it
is
a
taxable
gift
its
a
sticky
area
and
there
is
no
definitive
guidance
out
there
about
how
to
apply
this
in
the
daytoday
operation
of
a
household
he
said
given
the
tangle
of
terminology
and
rights
it
is
best
to
sit
down
with
a
financial
planner
and
perhaps
an
estate
planning
lawyer
to
work
through
your
individual
situation
unless
the
federal
government
recognizes
samesex
marriage
the
complexities
will
continue
its
like
seeing
someone
out
in
the
water
drowning
and
saying
i
will
give
them
a
lifesaver
but
i
wont
let
them

david
pratt
a
transfer
student
to
american
university
here
was
ready
to
settle
for
almost
anything
after
a
monthlong
housing
search
so
when
he
visited
a
row
house
in
the
georgetown
neighborhood
he
overlooked
the
peeling
paint
the
splintered
floorboards
the
shattered
windows
and
the
washing
machine
that
drained
onto
the
floor
i
didnt
notice
all
those
things
pratt
said
i
was
just
happy
to
have
found
the
place
in
august
when
pratt
and
his
housemates
moved
in
the
previous
tenants
were
gone
and
the
140yearold
houses
problems
were
glaring
disenchanted
pratt
22
began
looking
for
help
a
quick
internet
search
found
thisshouldbeillegalcom
a
web
site
set
up
in
august
by
city
housing
officials
as
part
of
a
campaign
for
students
and
others
looking
to
rent
legal
and
safe
housing
the
city
set
up
accounts
on
free
web
sites
including
facebook
twitter
and
wordpress
with
links
to
housing
codes
an
inspection
checklist
used
by
the
city
and
a
searchable
database
of
landlords
business
licenses
renters
can
also
use
the
sites
anonymously
to
report
violations
or
to
request
inspections
too
often
students
are
the
target
of
offcampus
landlords
trying
to
make
a
quick
buck
at
your
expense
linda
argo
the
director
of
the
program
said
in
a
videotaped
introduction
to
the
web
site
so
we
want
to
put
the
power
in
your
hands
more
than
9000
users
have
visited
and
a
third
of
them
have
used
the

said
michael

the

who
works
with
the
student
housing
campaign
rupert
who
lists
his
cell
phone
number
and
email
address
on
the
web
site
said
he
had
taken
more
than
200
inspection
requests
from
students
at
least
50
of
which
led
to
investigations
many
students
are
unaware
of
their
rights
as
renters
relying
on
first
impressions
of
housing
or
descriptions
from
online
listings
they
can
be
easy
prey
for
unscrupulous
landlords
argo
said
the
city
wanted
a
new
tool
to
ease
students
concerns
about
retaliation
and
even
eviction
for
reporting
illegal
rentals
or
unsafe
properties
officials
said
the
program
could
help
deal
with
problems
like
those
that
led
to
the
2004
death
of
daniel

a
21yearold
georgetown

died
of

investigators
said
metal

welded

a

108
of
129
campusrelated
fire
deaths
since

occurred
in

after
rigbys
death
fire
officials
said
students
turned
them
away
as
they
went
doortodoor
inspecting
houses
and
installing
smoke
detectors
the
traditional
methods
of
outreach
were
not
reaching
enough
students
because
there
was
too
much
hesitation
about
contacting
government
argo
said
there
were
too
many
unknowns
across
the
country
colleges
and
universities
have
tried
with
varying
degrees
of
success
to
mediate
landlordtenant
relationships
many
provide
rental
listings
inform
students
of
their
rights
as
renters
and
refer
students
to
the
proper
authorities
to
settle
housing
disputes
few
colleges
provide
legal
representation
for
students
who
have
problems
with
offcampus
housing
although
several
give
legal
advice
a

of
people
listen

a

dont

julie
battaile
a
university
spokeswoman
said
the
university
welcomed
the
citys
new
approach
the
biggest
thing
is
that
students
didnt
know
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
housing
inspection
that
they
could
get
battaile
said
they
want
to
know
that
kind
of
information
when
pratt
the
american
university
senior
and
his

got
no
response
to
their
complaints
from
the
property
manager
a
private
company
called
the
student
housing
association
pratt
called
rupert
within
two
days
an
inspector
checked
the
house
and
a
week
later
the
landlord
was
cited
for
17
violations
the
city
also
opened
investigations
of
the
owner
of
the
house
lewis
d
brown
who
did
not
have

to

company
brown
the
student

association
and
its

company
metropolitan

did
not
respond
to
repeated
calls
for
comment
pratt
said
that
a
month
after
he
contacted
the
city
the
property
manager
had
completed
several
repairs
including
the
windows
and
washing
machine
and
was
working
on
others
im
looking
forward
to
settling
this
he
said
some
newspaper
editors
are
wringing
their
hands
over
garry
trudeaus
decision
to
pen
several
doonesbury
strips
for
next
week
depicting
barack
obama
as
the
winner
of
the
election
but
for
the
politically
pugnacious
cartoonist
banking
on
an
obama
win
a
week
in
advance
had
zero
downside
i
never
considered
not
writing
about
the
election
but
to
avoid
lameness
i
had
to
predicate
it
on
an
outcome
trudeau
wrote
in
an
email
to
the
st
petersburg
times
if
obama
wins
im
in
the
flow
and
commenting
on
a
genuine
phenomenon
if
im
wrong
therell
be
such
a
global
uproar
that
a
goofy
call
in
a
comic
strip
isnt
going
to
be
much
noticed
but
trudeau
may
be
overly
modest
already
the
chicago
tribune
has
decided
to
take
the
nov
5
strip
off
its
regular
comics
pages
which
will
be
printed
before
the
election
results
are
known

some
newspapers
worry
that
if
sen
john
mccain
wins
theyll
be
stuck
with
at
least
four
strips
that
read
like
an
ongoing
dewey
defeats
truman
headline
touting
a
victory
that
didnt
happen
and
ticking
off
some
readers
if
obama
is
elected
president
in
doonesburys
world
said
tim
bannon
editor
of
the
chicago
tribunes
daily
features
section
will
he
stay
president
for
the
next
four
years
possibly
according
to
trudeau
who
said
it
would
be
a
great
idea
to
keep
obama
president
in
doonesbury
even
if
he
loses
at
the
st
petersburg
times
features
editor
mike
wilson
said
the
newspaper
will
run
trudeaus
strips
as
he
wrote
them
if
hes
right
the
people
who
like
him
still
like
him
and
the
people
who
hate
him
still
hate
him
wilson
wrote
in

if
hes
wrong
everybody
gets
a
dewey
defeats
truman
keepsake
and
the
people
who
hate
him
are
happier
than
ever
its
a
nolose
situation
here
are
trudeaus
responses
to
questions
from
the
times
what
inspired
you
to
write
this
strip
knowing
you
might
be
wrong
fivethirtyeightcom

is
probably
the
most
respected
of
the
poll
analysts
has
the

that
was
risk
assessment
i
could
live
with
what
do
you
think
of
editors
who
are
deciding
not
to
run
the
strip
i
think
more
of
them
it
means
theyre
reading
their
own
comics
what
would
it
say
about
american
voters
if
you
are
wrong
obama
would
graciously
say
that
the
voters
have
spoken
someone

mayor
louis

said
before
gore
took
the
stage
the
ballot
was
confusing
to
many
palm
beach
county
voters
because
it
listed
the
names
of
presidential
candidates
on
opposing
pages
apparently
leading
many
in
the
heavily
democratic
county
to
mistakenly
select
rightwing
thirdparty
candidate
pat
buchanan
instead
of
gore
it
was
one
of
a
string
of
mishaps
that
transfixed
the
country
indeed
the
world
as
a
recount
ensued
only
to
be
stopped
by
the
us
supreme
court
in
the
end
gore
lost
the

by

im
just
keeping

crossed
its
going

be

this

who
came
to
hear
gore
speak
in

palm

a
lot
of
us
who
have

already
wonder
if
the

are
going
to
count
or
not
gore
now
60
was
an
early
favorite
to
run
again
this
year
but
rebuffed
the
calls
since
his
spectacular
defeat
he
has
become
one
of
the
leading
voices
about
the
threat
of
global
warming
earning
him
the
nobel
peace
prize
in
2007
certainly
this
will
always
be
part
of

and
floridas
history
as
well
as
his
history
said
mitchell
berger
a
prominent
democratic
fundraiser
in

and
friend
of
gore
he
has
shown
us
all
how
to
get
up
from
a
defeat
and
move
on
and
rebuild
your
life
when
the
sheikh
mansour
bin
zayed
alnahyan
a
member
of
the
royal
family
of
abu
dhabi
swooped
in
last
month
to
buy
the
british
soccer
team
manchester

the

fans
were
titillated
by
the
bravado
of

front
man
sulaiman
alfahim
a

who
managed
the

for

vowed
to
lure

biggest

and
win
a
european
championship
and
socialized
with
pamela

but
when
it
came
time
to
appoint
a

to
run
the

business
side
the
flashy
fahim
was
replaced
by
one
of
the

most
trusted
advisers
khaldoon
almubarak
the
32yearold
director
of
abu
dhabis
highprofile
development
fund
mubadala
with
his
designer
stubble
and
perfectly
tailored

mubarak
cut
a
figure
of
suave
aplomb
as
he
watched
his
new
team
from
the
stands
later
he
issued
a
soothing
statement
about
developing
the
younger

and
the

it
spoke
again
on

as
sheikh

who
is
also
chairman
of

invested
almost
35
billion

that

hold
up
to
another
155
percent
with

in
turmoil
and
some
big
sovereign
wealth
funds
losing
billions
on
western
bets
one
of
the
questions
hanging
over
the
new
world
economic
disorder
has
been
whether
sovereign
wealth
and
other
state
funds
will
continue
to
slosh
around
the
world
the
new
barclays
investment
offered
a
resounding
yes
we
are
not
going
to
be
running
away
when
the

is
down
mubarak
said
in
a
brief
interview
last
month
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
opportunities
out
there
there
are
also
calls
for
greater
regulation
of
staterun
funds
fears
of
a
global
recession
and
oils
fall
from
14529
a
barrel
to
just
6781
on
friday
but
abu
dhabi
sits
atop
about
9
percent
of
the
worlds
oil
reserves
and
still
has
the
cash
to
spare
unlike
its
largerthanlife
neighbor
dubai
it
has
been
until
recently
hyperdiscreet
about
how
it
deploys
its
windfall
but
now
that
it
is
emerging
from
the
shadows
it
is
looking
for
attention

but
not
the
kind
of
flashanddash
that
dubai
is
known
for
and
mubarak
is
the
perfect
avatar
he
had
a
meteoric
ascent
from
a
sales
executive
for
abu
dhabis
oil
company
to
a
powerful
seat
on
abu
dhabis
governing
executive
council
and
oversight
of
mubadala
the
emirates
aggressive
development
fund
which
has
recently
made
several
highly
visible
strategic

these
have
included

in

and
more
recently
general
electric
the

the
abu

investment
authority
is
recognized
as
the
worlds
largest
it
has
an
estimated
600
billion
compared
with
mubadalas
more
than
10
billion
and
operates
behind
a
thick
veil
of
secrecy
the
authoritys
mandate
is
to
invest
abu

mubadalas
charge
is
to

in
joint

that

both
a

and
a
strategic
payback
for
the

mubarak
has
become
abu

said
christopher

a
professor
at

in

who
has
written
an
economic
history
of

he
has
the
ear
of
the

and
he
can
step
in

is

mubarak
appeared
this
summer
on
cnbc
with
ges
chief
executive
jeffrey
r
immelt
to
promote
an
8
billion
joint
venture
focused
on
commercial
finance
in
the
middle
east
and

and
he
openly
signaled
mubadalas
plan
to
become
one
of
ges
10
largest
shareholders
by
july
mubadala
is
expected
to
have
completed
its
planned
accumulation
of
ge
stock
a
financial
commitment
that
could
surpass
3
billion
to
a
large
extent
mubadalas
increasingly
public
profile
tracked
the
rise
in
the
price
of
oil
to
a
peak
of
14529
a
barrel
this
summer
falling
oil
surpluses
will
most
likely
create
a
rising
need
for
money
to
support
local
economies
and
markets
the
federal
government
of
the
united
arab
emirates
has
already
disbursed
more
than
30
billion
to
support
local
banks
but
waleed
almokarrab
the
chief
operating
officer
for
mubadala
points
out
that
last
year
the
average
price
of
oil
was
80
we
do
not
expect
a
massive
change
for
next
year
he
said
suggesting
the
deals
will
keep
coming
so
far
mubadala
has
invested
in
sectors
like
aerospace
health
care
gas
and
aluminum
production
water
purification
computer
chips
and
with
ge
commercial
finance
we
are
literally
a
development
company
said
mokarrab
like
mubarak
he
was
educated
in
the
united
states
and
has
a
fondness
for
americanstyle
business
school
jargon
to
wit
they
call
the
abu
dhabi
government
their
shareholder
refer
to
investments
as
game
changers
and
speak
fluently
of
internal
rates
of
return
we
take
money
from
our
shareholder
and
we
create
businesses
on
the
ground
mokarrab
added
we
are
building
a
country
together
unlike
the
investment
authority
mubadala
uses
debt
to
help
finance
some
projects

crucially
with
the
guarantee
of
abu
dhabis
cash
reserves
the
portfolio
is
financed
on
a
ratio
of
60
percent
equity
to
40
percent
debt
while
mubaraks
smooth
western
ways
and
his
acumen
have
impressed
investors
his
close
relationship
with
the
crown
prince
the
younger
halfbrother
of
abu
dhabis
ruler
and
his
expected
successor
is
behind
mubaraks
increasing
prominence
he
heads
an
elite
advisory
group
called
the
executive
affairs
authority
that
advises
the
crown
prince
who
is
considered
the
leading
voice
for
cautiously
modernizing
the
emirate
on
a
range
of
economic
financial
social
and
communications
issues
compared
with
to
its
two
flanking
neighbors
saudi
arabia
and
iran
abu
dhabi
has
made
bold
strides
yet
its
disposition
remains
secretive
and
its
outlook
cautious
a
reflection
of
the
conservative
spirit
of
its
ruler
sheik
khalifa
bin
zayed
alnahyan
all
of
which
makes
mubarak
all
the
more
crucial
if
you
have
his
leadership
skills
and
you
can
speak
for
the
crown
prince
and
you
have
money
that
is
a
very
effective
combination
said
david
rubenstein
a
cofounder
of
the
carlyle
group
still
with
oil
prices
continuing
to
fall
and
the
persian
gulfs
own
economies
showing
strains
many
analysts
expect
the
busy
dealmaking
of
the
last
year
to
slow

somewhat
even
with
oil
around
60
a
barrel
abu
dhabi
clears
a
healthy
surplus
and
the
emirate
is
likely
to
move
cautiously
but
purposefully
toward
a
more
active
role
in
the
international
financial
community
with
mubarak
and
mubadala
front
and
center
he
has
a

of

who
calls
mubarak
a

he
is
a
great
public
face
for

as
well
as
being
one
of
the
great
young

3
million
students
mills
63
said
in
an
interview
on
friday
that
he
had
decided
it
was
time
for
a
change
after
leading
the
education
department
through
a
critical
period
that
has
brought
higher
standards
for
academic
achievement
and
for
the
first
time
has
held
school
districts
accountable
for
student
performance
on
standardized
tests
i
dont
want
to
get
to
a
point
where
im
tired
and
out
of
ideas
and
then
say
im
leaving
he
said
i
want
to
leave
at
the
top
of
my
game
and
help
the
board
of
regents
up
until
the
end
mills
who
is
paid
195000
a
year
was
appointed
in
1995
by
the
board
of
regents
whose
16
members
are
selected
by
the
state
legislature
for
fiveyear
terms
mills
was
previously
the
education
commissioner
of
vermont
for
seven
years
robert
m
bennett
the
chancellor
of
the
board
of
regents
said
that
a
national
search
would
be
held
this
winter
to
find
mills
successor
under
mills
tenure
the
state
has
raised
high
school
graduation
rates
while
making
college
preparatory
courses
known
as
regents
courses
a
requirement
and
making
the
regents
diploma
which
is
granted
to
students
who
pass
regents
exams
in
core
subjects
the
standard
for
all
students
in
addition
the
number
of
credits
required
for
graduation
rose
to
225
from
205
his
goal
was
that
every
district
would
have
a
100
percent
graduation
rate
and
i
think
by
and
large
you
see
improvements
across
the
board
said
henry

and
former

jerichos
graduation
rate
has
averaged
between
98
percent
and
100
percent
in
each
of
the
last
three
years
up
from
about
85
percent
in
the
mid1990s
with
the
regents
backing
mills
in
1999
began
holding
districts
accountable
for
student
performance
on
state
achievement
tests
a
practice
that
later
became
mandatory
under
the
2001
federal
law
called
no
child
left
behind
the
state
also
established
a
system
of
state
report
cards
to
help
parents
and
community
members
evaluate
their
local
schools
in
particular
mills
and
state
education
officials
made
it
a
priority
to
close
the
achievement
gap
for
poor
and
minority
students
by
advocating
for
more
financial
resources
for
districts
with
large
numbers
of
poor
and
disadvantaged
students
and
by
eventually
developing
a
new
school
aid
formula
that
allocated
more
money
for
highneeds
districts
including
new
york
citys
what
weve
learned
is
that
the
direction
set
by
a
state
leader
matters
a
lot
in
terms
of
whether
kids
learn
or
dont
said
kati
haycock
president
of
the
education
trust
an
advocacy
group
based
in
washington
if
you
judge
this
man
by
the
improvement
in
achievement
especially
among
minority
and
poor
students
you
would
have
to
say
that
he
helped
bring
about
some
of
the
biggest
gains
in
the
country
but
some
educators
and
parents
have
said
that
mills
placed
too
much
emphasis
on
standardized
testing

with
the
result
that
many
schools
focused
on
drilling
students
on
basic
skills
in
english
and
math
that
were
covered
on
tests
at
the
expense
of
more
creative
forms
of
instruction
in
poetry
and
writing
as
well
as
in
enrichment
activities
like
art
music
and
even
field
trips
mills
has
also
been
criticized
for
his
oversight
of
the
2800student
roosevelt
school
district
on
long
island
which
struggled
with
financial
problems
and
weak
student
performance
for
years
after
it
was
taken
over
by
the
education
department
in
2002
in
january
the
state
legislature
approved
an
8
million
bailout
for
the
district
to
settle
an
accumulated
debt
that
had
threatened
to
cripple
its
daily
operations
mills
said
he
wished
that
he
had
known
about
roosevelts
recent
financial
problems
sooner
but
moved
quickly
to
address
them
once
he
did
he
pointed
out
that
the
state
had
built
new
buildings
in
the
district
and
sent
in
some
of
the
states
top
administrators
to
oversee
improvements
he
said
that
while
standardized
testing
was
necessary
as
a
way
to
gauge
student
achievement
fairly
and
consistently
he
had
also
emphasized
the
need
for
art
and
music
and
other
creative
pursuits
mills
got
his
start
in
education
as
a
history
teacher
at
the
dalton
school
on
the
upper
east
side
of
manhattan
from
1967
to
1971
after
earning
bachelors
and
masters
degrees
in
history
from
middlebury
college
and
columbia
university
he
subsequently
helped
establish
and
run
the
elizabeth
seeger
school
an
alternative
public
high
school
on
west
12th
street
mills
said
that
he
planned
to
continue
working
in
the
education
field
and
would
be
considering
his
options
after
stepping
down
as
commissioner
it
will
be
hard
to
leave
in
june
but
theres
time
to
get
a
lot
of
work
done
between
now
and
then

said
this
experience
has
been

the
talks
were
described
by
people
who
were
briefed
on
them
and
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
to
avoid
conflict
among
the
parties
kathleen
kennedy
a
producer
of
spielbergs
project
did
not
respond
to
a
query
peter
nelson
a
lawyer
for
jackson
declined
to
comment
as
did
a
sony
pictures
spokesman
steve
elzer
a
spokeswoman
for
paramount
also
declined
to
comment
the
negotiations
began
after
universal
pictures
backed
away
last
month
from
an
arrangement
under
which
it
would
have
shared
the
project
based
on
the
longrunning
belgian
comic
strip
about
a
globetrotting
young
reporter
with
paramount
spielberg
has
been
eager
to
begin
shooting
the
first
movie
as
early
as
this
year
using
motioncapture
technology
that
combines
live
actors
with
computer
animation
he
has
already
filmed
parts
of
the
picture
but
universal
which
had
an
option
to
become
involved
because
spielberg
started
the
project
there
25
years
ago
shocked
many
in
hollywood
by
declaring
it
too
risky
despite
the
participation
of
spielberg
who
has
kept
his
offices
on
universals
lot
for
decades
the
first
films
budget
of
about
130
million
is
not
exceptionally
large
by
contemporary
standards
but
spielberg
and
jackson
as
two
of
the
industrys
most
prestigious
directors
were
demanding
nearly
a
third
of
the
movies
gross
receipts

terms
that
proved
difficult
at
a
time
when
studios
were
tightening
belts
paramount
later
offered
to
make
the
movie
on
terms
it
found
more
favorable
but
the
directors
representatives
pressed
for
alternatives
sony
offered
to
take
the
movie
under
a
deal
more
to
the
filmmakers
liking
but
paramount
was
reluctant
to
let
go
entirely
and
began
discussing
a
partnership
according
to
one
of
the
people
briefed
on
the
discussions
under
the
deal
now
being
discussed
paramount
would
distribute
the
tintin
movies
in
north
america
and
some
englishspeaking
territories
while
sony
would
distribute
the
pictures
in
various
foreign
territories
including
europe
and
latin
america
according
to
a
person
briefed
on
the
talks
in
recent
years
studios
have
routinely
split
some
of
their
more
expensive
movies
usually
by
leaving
one
studio
with
foreign
distribution
rights
and
another
with
domestic
thus
the
curious
case
of
benjamin
button
a
coming
film
directed
by
david
fincher
and
starring
brad
pitt
will
be
distributed
by
paramount
in
the
united
states
and
by
warner
brothers
abroad
for
sony
a
deal
would
be
the
first
time
spielberg
has
worked
with
the
studio
as
a
director
since
1991
when
he
made
hook
for
the
companys
tristar
pictures
unit
in
1977
spielberg
made
close
encounters
of
the
third
kind
one
of
his
biggest
hits
for
columbia
long
before
the
studio
was
acquired
by
sony
the
first
tintin
movie
is
expected
to
be
ready
for
release
in
2010
jacksons
installment
would
come
some
time
after
but
does
not
yet
have
a
completed
script
for
paramount
a
deal
would
be
one
more
step
in
the
readjustment
of
its
relations
with
spielberg
and
his
new
dreamworks
company
the
studio
had
acquired
dreamworks
in
2006
but
spielberg
and
his
associates
left
to
form
a
new
venture
under
the
same
name
last
month
spielberg
is
expected
to
remain
involved
with
a
number
of
paramount
projects
in
coming
months
he
has
a
producing
role
for
instance
on
transformers
revenge
of
the
fallen
a
sequel
set
for
release
in
june
meanwhile
his
new
company
remains
entangled
with
paramount
through
their
mutual
interest
in
dozens
of
development
projects
that
are
owned
by
the
big
studio
but
may
be
produced
and
distributed
through
collaborative
arrangements

them

coming

that

included
several
state

although
the
ones
for
elementaryschoolers
were
made
up
not
surprisingly
they
shot
down
an
initiative
that
called
for
students
to
eat
at
least
a
serving
of
vegetables
at
lunch
or
risk
losing
recess
time
while
parents
often
shape

political

many
secondary

burien
social

specialist
michael
mcsweeney
spent
weeks
discussing
the
election
with
his
students
he
has
urged
them
to
compare
the
presidential
candidates
stances
on
various
issues
and
helped
eligible
students
register
to
voteall
without
giving
away
his
own
political
views
it
has
had
a
profound
effect
on
mt
rainier
high
school
student
michael
anderson
who
said
he
grew
up
in
a
democraticleaning
family
and
had
supported
obama
but
in
mcsweeneys
class
hes
studied
both
candidates
and
finds
himself
drawn
to
john
mccain
because
of
his
views
on
abortion
and
gay
marriage
im
still
kind
of
confused
in
the
middle
he
said
but
im
realizing
you
really
have
to
look
at
both
sides
at
pacific
middle
school
in
des
moines
teachers
challenged
students
to
rethink
their
political
views
by
reading
articles
written
by
obama
or
mccain
with
the
candidates
names
removed
the
teens
shared
what
they
liked
about
each
piece
and
what
inspired
themwithout
knowing
who
wrote
what
some
students
were
surprised
to
find
out
they
liked
the
other
guy
said
jennifer
christenson
who
teaches
social
studies
and
leadership
a
lot
of
them
hear
things
at
home
and
thats
their
primary
source
of
information
she
said
this
helps
them
see
the
bigger
picture
the
school
will
hold
a
mock
presidential
election
early
next
week
followed
by
another
election
thursday
to
choose
studentbody
officers
student
candidates
submitted
brief
biographies
and
photos
which
were
compiled
into
a

pamphlet
top
finishers
in
the
schools
primary
last
week
were
allowed
to
hang
one
campaign
poster
in
the
cafeteria
and
will
deliver
a
speech
to
classmates
thursday
morning
the
timing
is
perfect
christenson
said
we
can
mirror
whats
going
on
in
the
real
world
the
cosmetic
company
avon
products
traces
its
roots
to
the
horse
and
buggy
days
of
the
late
19th
century
when
sales
representatives
sold
perfume
doortodoor
often
to
women
who
lived
far
from
big
department
stores
this
american
frontier
model
has
translated
well
to
countries
like
brazil
and
china
where
large
populations
are
dispersed
across
a
vast
countryside
today
more
than
twothirds
of
avons
sales
are
outside
the
united
states
the
directselling
model

where
independent
sales
representatives
do
not
work
directly
for
avon

makes
it
easier
to
break
into
new
markets
says
avons
chairwoman
and
chief
executive
andrea
jung
about
55
million
sales
representatives
now
sell
avon
products
be
it
lip
gloss
in
shanghai
china
or
face
powder
in
rio
de
janeiro
brazil
the
company
reporting
its
thirdquarter
earnings
thursday
said
the
only
region
where
sales
fell
was
north
america
which
it
defines
as
the
united
states
canada
and
puerto
rico
by
contrast
revenue
rose
25
percent
in
both
latin
america
and
china
and
8
percent
in
western
europe
the
middle
east
and
africa
jung
who
was
born
the
daughter
of
chinese
immigrants
in
toronto
and
moved
to
a
suburb
of
boston
when
she
was
10
recently
discussed
how
she
thinks
the
companys
directselling
model
can
improve
the
lives
of
women
in
developing
countries
and
where
the
next
big
growth
opportunities
are
for
avon
q
since
you
became
the
chief
of
avon
in
1999
the
company
has
expanded
into
emerging
markets
why
do
you
think
your
directselling
model
works
so
well
in
developing
countries
jung
it
is
part
of
a
movement
around
the
world
for
women
to
have
more
economic
independence
from
her
very
first
order
a
representative
does
not
have
to
pull
the
money
out
of
her
pocket
we
send
her
the
products
and
she
pays
us
after
she
sells
them
the
directselling
model
does
not
have
to
be
centered
around
where
there
is
heavy
retail
infrastructure
either
for
example
china
is
going
to
be
one
of
avons
largest
market
opportunities
it
has
a
large
geographic
expanse
with
hundreds
of
thousands
of
women
in
small
villages
really
striving
to
make
an
earnings
opportunity
for
themselves
q
and
the
majority
of
your
independent
sales
representatives
are
women
jung
well
over
95
percent
are
women
and
the
men
are
often
in
avon
couples
i
love
those
conversations
where
the
husbands
tell
me
that
they
quit
their
jobs
because
their
wifes
business
was
doing
so
well
so
theyve
joined
forces
to
run
the
business
as
a
couple
q
given
the
fact
that
your
sales
representatives
are
not
employed
by
avon
how
do
you
establish
new
markets
jung
we
hire
recruiting
managers
who
are
avon
employees
they
start
canvassing
for
representatives
in
work
places
in
religious
gatherings
in
school
fundraisers
we
also
run
recruiting
advertisements
in
a
dozen
markets
today
and
we
train
our
representatives
how
to
manage
their
businesses
online
for
example
in
turkey
where
there
is
not
much
internet
penetration
we
have
close
to
100
percent
of
our
sales
representatives
entering
their
orders
online
they
go
to
internet
cafes
or
libraries
q
how
do
you
deal
with
economic
uncertainty
in
emerging
markets
jung
with
whats
going
on
the
last
couple
of
weeks
it
reminds
me
of
the
very
difficult
time
we
had
in
russia
i
recall
in
the
late
90s
with
the
massive
devaluation
of
the
ruble
our
russian
business
really
became
quite
challenged
some
companies
were
retrenching
but
we
looked
across
russia
and
saw
11
time
zones
with
women
in
every
small
town
and
village
who
wanted
the
opportunity
to
be
economically
independent
so
we
were
committed
to
staying
q
do
you
feel
that
your
experience
growing
up
as
the
daughter
of
chinese
immigrants
has
influenced
your
career
jung
it
has
given
me
a
global
vantage
point
being
the
daughter
of
immigrants
from
china
who
had
nothing
when
they
came
here
and
now
i
am
leading
a
company
it
speaks
to
something
deep
in
me
the
concept
that
you
dont
have
to
start
with
anything
the
directsales
opportunity
allows
people
to
change
their
lives
q
many
of
your
customers
are
familiar
with
the
work
of
the
avon
foundation
but
they
might
not
know
that
you
have
similar
programs
in
countries
like
mexico
and
malaysia
how
global
is
your
philanthropy
now
jung
weve
got
programs
in
around
50
different
countries
together
we
have
raised
580
million
mostly
for
breast
cancer
research
diagnosis
and
treatment
a
couple
of
years
ago
we
added
a
second
issue
violence
against
women
we
have
made
educational
pamphlets
about
breast
selfexams
and
about
domestic
violence
which
our
representatives
can
give
to
their
customers
we
have
donated
mammography
units
to
underserved
hospitals
in
spain
and
created
mobile
mammography
units
in
china
recently
i
had
one
of
those
amazing
experiences
where
life
and
work
intersect
my
maternal
grandmother
who
was
from
mainland
china
died
of
breast
cancer
in
singapore
in
the
1970s
it
was
diagnosed
at
a
late
stage
and
she
just
passed
away
it
was
something
that
wasnt
talked
about
back
then
it
was
the
c
word
about
a
year
ago
my
mother
discovered
that
she
had
breast
cancer
she
was
diagnosed
at
an
avon
breast
cancer
center
which
our
people
worked
so
hard
to
donate
to
mass
general
it
was
detected
at
a
very
early
stage
with
digital
mammography
and
one
year
later
she
is
cancerfree
when
i
look
at
the
two
generations
in
my
own
family
it
shows
the
progress
that
has
been
made
on
this
issue
over
the
last
30
years
tampa
all
agreed
that
the
new
chief
at
us
central
command
needs
no
introduction
gen
david
petraeus
widely
feted
as
the
architect
behind
the
iraq
troop
surge
took
the
helm
at
centcom
on
friday
in
an
hourlong
ceremony
under
fluttering
flags
off
hillsborough
bay
petraeus
comes
to
centcom
headquarters
at
macdill
air
force
base
with
enormous
political
capital
and
the
kind
of
military
reputation
seldom
seen
in
the
days
since
world
war
ii
as
the
outgoing
centcom
commander
lt
gen
martin
dempsey
joked
you
probably
need
less
introduction
than
anyone
i
know
petraeus
comes
to
centcom
with
the
challenge
of
stemming
the
rising
violence
in
afghanistan
petraeus
55
shook
dempseys
hand
the
pair
are
from
the
same
west
point
class
of
1974
and
offered
a
few
quiet
words
as
he
took
official
responsibility
for
centcoms
area
of
responsibility
that
responsibility
is
one
of
the
largest
in
the
us
military
nearly
two
dozen
countries
including
oversight
for
the
wars
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
and
other
hot
spots
such
as
pakistan
petraeus
who
has
served
three
tours
in
iraq
including
one
as
commander
of
the
101st
airborne
division
is
credited
with
policies
helping
curb
violence
in
iraq
and
expectations
that
he
will
do
the
same
in
afghanistan
could
hardly
be
higher
defense
secretary
robert
gates
praised
petraeus
and
dempsey
who
had
been
the
acting
centcom
commander
for
seven
months
after
adm
william
fallon
was
forced
to
resign
speaking
of
petraeus
gates
said
history
will
regard
him
as
one
of
our
nations
great
battle
captains
he
is
the
preeminent
soldier
scholar
statesman
of
his
generation
and
he
is
precisely
the
man
we
need
at
this
command

now
he
will
take
aim
at
our
adversaries
in
afghanistan
petraeus
who
had
served
as
the
overall
ground
commander
in
iraq
since
early
2007
is
expected
to
quickly
travel
back
to
centcoms
area
of
responsibility
in
the
middle
east
the
general
warned
all
the
way
ahead
will
be
difficult
never
thought
id
see
the
day
when
those
two
drama
kings
of
the
hemispheres
david
beckham
and
diego
maradona
would
be
overshadowed
by
a
secondstring
goalkeeper
from
major
league
soccer
but
that
is
exactly
what
happened
recently
as
one
soaring
free
kick
by
danny
cepero
making
his
league
debut
for
the
red
bulls
bounced
into
the
opposing
goal
bend
that
david
and
diego
goals
by
goalkeepers
happen
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
manbitesdog
events

even
more
than
home
runs
by
pitchers
or
touchdowns
by
lumbering
350pound
linemen
ive
always
loved
the
sight
of
feral
keepers
like
rene
higuita
and
jose
luis
chilavert
and
jorge
campos
renaissance
men
from
the
americas

of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
has
become
an
instant
legend
cepero
will
be
in
goal
saturday
at
4
pm
when
the
red
bulls
open
the
playoffs
against
houston
at
giants
stadium
he
promises
no
such
fireworks
like
the
81yard
goal
he
unleashed
on
oct
18

a
freakish
bounce
on
the
home
artificial
turf
the
first
keepers
goal
in
13
years
of
the
leagues
existence
the
goal
managed
to
eclipse
the
latest
buzz
from
the
peripatetic
beckham
and
the
erratic
maradona
beckham
arranged
to
take
the
winter
semester
in
italy
on
loan
from
the
los
angeles
galaxy
to
ac
milan
so
that
he
can
keep
sharp
for
possible
duty
with
the
english
national
team
maradonas
odyssey
is
far
more
bizarre
bounced
out
of
world
soccer
because
of
his
drug
habit
nearly
dead
from
his
appetites
he
is
becoming
the
coach
of
argentina

the
equivalent
of
the
united
states
putting
jose
canseco
in
charge
of
the
us
team
for
next
years
world
baseball
classic
however
beckhams
and
maradonas
pursuits
pale
compared
with
ceperos
awesome
kick
cepero
got
his
chance
because
two
teammates
including
the
resident
keeper
jon
conway
were
each
suspended
for
10
games
because
of
a
positive
drug
test

from
an
overthecounter
supplement
they
had
considered
safe
they
said
cepero
23
had
played
two
reserve
games
for
the
red
bulls
hes
one
of
the
more
cerebral
chaps
on
the
team
des
mcaleenan
the
teams
goalkeeper
coach
said
he
reads
hes
very
likable
never
too
high
never
too
low
in
fact
cepero
is
earning
the
last
credits
toward
his
degree
at
penn
driving
down
to
philadelphia
each
week
for
a
course
the
end
of
european
empire
which
he
said
was
about
decolonization
concentrating
on
britain
he
also
studies
his
arcane
craft
mcaleenan
who
has
trained
international
keepers
like
tony
meola
and
tim
howard
with
this
franchise
has
encouraged
cepero
to
produce
long
goal
kicks
to
give
the
offense
a
chance
to
work
mischief
at
the
far
end
mcaleenan
noted
that
cepero
was
not
among
the
strongest
kickers
he
had
coached
some
keepers
insist
on
taking
free
kicks
and
penalty
kicks
rogerio
ceni
of
brazil
has
produced
more
than
80
goals
in
domestic
competition
according
to
fifacom
chilavert
of
paraguay
has
produced
more
than
60
and
higuita
of
colombia
more
than
40
the
exact
totals
are
obscured
by
various
league
matches
over
the
years
then
there
was
the
flamboyant
campos
of
mexico
who
not
only
took
the
occasional
kick
but
also
would
take
the
ball
upfield
with
his
dancing
feet
or
even
play
striker
when
the
mood
struck
my
mother
is
from
mexico
and
she
is
a
big
fan
of
campos
cepero
said
adding
that
many
latino
keepers
have
an
admirable
flair
for
the
dramatic
he
did
score
a
few
goals
as
a
teenager
in
baldwin
ny
playing
the
field
but
he
is
hardly
a
freekick
candidate
pressed
into
duty
with
two
days
notice
on
oct
18
cepero
had
a
21
lead
in
the
83rd
minute
given
a
direct
kick
he
lined
up
the
ball
on
the
left
side
about
25
yards
upfield
motioning
his
teammates
to
move
forward
and
he
let
fly
from
threequarters
of
the
field
away
he
saw
the
ball
take
a
high
bounce
over
the
columbus
keeper
also
a
backup
then
he
saw
a
flutter
in
the
cords
of
the
net
ceperos
vision
was
so
obscured
that
he
did
not
see
the
ball
go
in
but
he
received
a
context
clue
when
teammates
rushed
upfield
and
hugged
him
i
expected
it
to
happen
on
this
field
mcaleenan
said
referring
to
the
artificial
turf
that
is
carpet
over
concrete
it
just
happened
to
be
danny
since
that
stunning
moment
cepero
has
received
messages
from
strangers
from
as
far
away
as
croatia
and
cyprus
as
well
as
from
old
friends
but
no
endorsements
and
no
recreation
of
the
kick
straight
down
broadway
for
the
letterman
show
at
least
not
yet
reality
hit
home
in
the
next
game
when
the
red
bulls
lost
52
at
chicago
mcaleenan
blaming
their
nonexistent
defense
the
red
bulls
were
lucky
to
squeak
into
the
playoffs
when
dc
united
stumbled
in
its
final
game
this
has
been
a
starcrossed
franchise
since
its
first
home
game
as
the
metrostars
when
a
hapless
defender
from
italys
top
league
bumbled
in
an
own
goal
now
danny
cepero
has
overshadowed
david
beckham
and
diego
maradona
could
this
franchises
dismal
karma
finally
be
changing
tampa
jon
gruden
made
a
certain
observation
about
new
return
man
clifton
smith
on
sunday
at
dallas
the
buccaneers
coach
noticed
smith
has
a
particularly
good
sense
of
direction
knowing
the
best
way
to
get
up
the
field
is
going
north
and
south
i
like
that
a
lot
of
guys
go
backward
gruden
said
im
not
saying
dexter
jackson
did
or
does
im
just
saying
that
a
lot
of
guys
retreat
because
theres
no
one
there
jackson
is
the
guy
whose
job
smith
an
undrafted
rookie
appears
to
have
taken
one
of
jacksons
flaws
as
the
primary
returner
during
weeks
17
was
a
tendency
to
cut
back
in
an
effort
to
gain
yards
laterally
conversely
smith
charged
forward
each
time
he
handled
a
punt
or
kickoff
against
the
cowboys
making
for
an
impressive
pro
debut
that
was
marred
slightly
by
a
lost
fumble
smiths
first
touch
was
a
20yard
punt
return
the
bucs
longest
of
the
season
theres
a
fearlessness
about
smith
that
makes
him
appealing
its
a
hard
thing
to
come
by
to
go
out
and
find
a
player
who
will
sacrifice
his
body
to
run
up
and
catch
a
ball
hit
a
hole
and
be
able
to
give
the
offense
what
it
needs
and
keep
the
defense
off
the
field
smith
23
said
you
dont
have
to
remind
gruden
how
rare
a
breed
he
is
when
you
go
forward
theres
everybody
coming
at
you
he
said
its
not
a
job
that
everybody
is
after
there
arent
a
lot
of
guys
that
want
to
return
kickoffs
and
punts
in
the
national
football
league
you
stand
down
there
on
the
sidelines
and
i
stand
behind
players
its
a
bizarre
scene
these
guys
are
flying
down
there
its
not
for
everybody
smith
was
a
regular
returner
at
fresno
state
and
had
great
success
as
a
sophomore
he
set
an
ncaa
record
with
three
punt
returns
for
189
yards
and
two
touchdowns
against
weber
state
and
he
attended
a
school
that
is
renowned
for
its
emphasis
on
special
teams
we
led
the
country
in
blocked
kicks
and
other
special
teams
categories
he
said
playing
special
teams
taught
me
to
be
a
versatile
player
i
can
run
down
on
a
kickoff
and
know
what
im
doing
i
can
come
off
the
edge
and
be
a
punt
rusher
and
block
punts
it
helped
a
lot
how
did
the
experience
translate
to
the
nfl
smith
said
he
believes
he
made
an
impression
in
dallas
and
its
hard
to
argue
he
was
unspectacular
on
kickoffs
averaging
207
yards
on
three
returns
but
on
punts
he
was
a
significant
upgrade
averaging
164
yards
to
jacksons
49
but
smith
worries
what
he
will
be
remembered
for
more
his
decisive
running
or
his
fumble
of
the
secondhalf
kickoff
that
dallas
recovered
i
felt
like
i
opened
some
eyes
he
said
but
then
again
ill
have
that
question
mark
over
my
head
like
well
he
might
be
a
fumbler
which
is
a
stigma
i
dont
want
on
me
at
all
its
not
my
game
to
put
the
ball
on
the
ground
the
good
news
for
him
is
he
likely
will
get
another
shot
sunday
in
kansas
city
after
spending
seven
weeks
on
the
practice
squad
smith
has
learned
to
wait
his
turn
its
always
tough
to
be
patient
he
said
but
thats
the
name
of
the
game
they
always
say
its
a
long
season
and
something
is
bound
to
happen
and
before
you
know
it
itll
be
on
you
to
go
out
there
and
take
advantage
of
your
opportunities
sure
enough
smiths
time
is
now

matt
grothe
said
monday
that
nippert
stadium
was
his
favorite
place
the
bulls
had
visited
if
only
for
the
oldschool
design
of
the
bearcats
homefield
but
the
quarterback
cant
be
as
happy
with
his
performances
at
nippert
where
the
bulls
have
seen
two
lopsided
losses
and
the
two
lowestrated
performances
of
his
usf
career
they
had
us
tonight
thats
all
i
can
say
grothe
said
after
thursdays
2410
loss
we
couldnt
do
anything
they
did
a
good
job
of
stopping
us
and
we
did
a
good
job
of
stopping
ourselves
grothe
selected
as
a
game
captain
for
the
first
time
in
his
bulls
career
went
13for31
on
thursday
with
no
touchdowns
and
three
interceptions
it
marked
the
lowest
completion
percentage
of
his
35
career
games
and
his
passer
rating
of
208
is
also
his
lowest
ever
the
juniors
previous
low
rating
was
his
last
game
at
nippert
a
238
loss
in
2006
that
saw
him
pass
for
47
yards
in
21
attempts
grothe
has
had
only
three
games
at
usf
in
which
he
failed
to
pass
or
rush
for
a
touchdown
two
of
them
have
come
at
nippert
thursdays
statistics
werent
all
grothes
fault
as
his
receivers
consistently
failed
to
bring
in
catchable
passes
with
at
least
five
drops
on
a
night
in
which
cincinnatis
receivers
had
several
highlightreel
catches
grothes
third
interception
came
on
a
pass
that
te
cedric
hill
juggled
into
the
arms
of
cb
deangelo
smith
asked
what
has
changed
about
usf
from
the
team
that
opened
50
and
was
ranked
no
10
just
a
month
ago
grothe
said
he
didnt
have
an
answer
i
have
no
idea
he
said
thats
a
good
question
something
big
change
before
thursday
cincinnati
hadnt
converted
a
third
down
in
its
previous
two
games
going
a
combined
0for25
but
the
bearcats
had
no
such
troubles
against
the
bulls
qb
tony
pike
converted
on
third
and
10
in
the
first
quarter
with
a
48yard
pass
to
wr
marty
gilyard
the
bearcats
went
4for5
on
third
downs
in
the
first
half
in
building
a
177
lead
this
and
that
the
49yard
field
goal
by
freshman
maikon
bonani
is
a
season
long
for
him
by
5
yards
its
the
fourth
longest
in
usf
history
and
the
longest
since
delbert
alvarado
hit
a
big

56yarder
against
syracuse
in
2006

who
played
sparingly
sunday
against
the

has
a
pinched
nerve
in
his
back
and
did
not
practice
this
week
its
likely
he
will
be
held
out
against
the
chiefs
and
replaced
by
michael
bennett
in
the
end
it
will
be
a
gametime
decision
these

that

eight

10
12
years
theres
a
reason
why
they
do
that
coach
jon

said
the

who
have
had
the
kind
of
careers
that
warrick
has
had
they
all
play
through
so
many
different
things
if
he
can
go
based
on
our
eyes
and
our
visual
evaluation
well
certainly
let
him
play
but
for
the
time
being
weve
got
to
do
whats
right
too
and
thats
wait
until
we
see
it
happen

wednesday
even
though
it

and
players
werent
wearing

he
also
will
be
a

decision
if
sears
cant
go
rookie
jeremy
zuttah
will
start
you
try
to
reduce
contact
and
you
have
a
collision
gruden
said
that
just
shows
you
a
little
about
our
team
you
have
a
tendency
to
go
a
little
too
hard

edwards
chiefs
appear
to
be
circling
the
drain
they
have
a
secondyear
quarterback
in
tyler
thigpen
from
coastal
carolina
who
is
making
his
third
nfl
start
but
edwards
is
rebuilding
with
high
draft
picks
on
defense
and
their
lone
victory
came
at
home
against
a
broncos
team
that
now
leads
the
afc
west
at
43
thats
enough
for
gruden
to
channel
lou
holtz
the
former
notre
dame
coach
famous
for
building
up
opponents
if
you
look
at
the
film
theyre
a
good
defensive
team
gruden
said
theyve
yielded
some
big
plays
and
a
lot
of
the
big
plays
theyve
given
up
have
been
at
the
end
of
games
where
theyre
frantically
trying
to
get
the
ball
back
they
played
denver
extremely
well
they
had
the
jets
beat
on
sunday
before
losing
late
theyre
a
hard
team
to
throw
the
ball
against
ive
been
to
arrowhead
stadium
enough
times
it
never
matters
what
their
record
is
or
what
the
stakes
are
they
play
their
butts
off
in
their
stadium
and
weve
got
to
know
that
when
proposition
k
was
added
to
tuesdays
ballot
many
people
likely
snickered
at
the
possibility
that
san
francisco
might
take
its
place
alongside
such
prostitutefriendly
havens
as
amsterdam
and
a
few
rural
counties
in
nearby
nevada
but
this
week
it
became
readily
apparent
that
city
officials
are
not
laughing
anymore
about
the
measure
which
would
effectively
decriminalize
the
worlds
oldest
profession
in
san
francisco
at
a
news
conference
on
wednesday
mayor
gavin
newsom
and
other
opponents
seemed
genuinely
worried
that
proposition
k
might
pass
this
is
not
cute
this
is
not
fanciful
newsom
said
standing
in
front
of
the
pinkonpink
facade
of
a
closed
massage
parlor
in
the
tenderloin
district
this
is
a
big
mistake
supporters
of
the
measure
say
it
is
a
longoverdue
correction
of
a
criminal
approach
toward
prostitutes
which
neither
rehabilitates
nor
helps
them
and
often
ignores
their
complaints
of
abuse
basically
if
you
feel
that
youre
a
criminal
it
can
be
used
against
you
said
carol
leigh
who
says
she
has
worked
as
a
prostitute
for
35
years
and
now
works
as
an
advocate
for
those
who
trade
sex
for
money
its
a
really
serious
situation
and
ending
this
criminalization
is
the
only
solution
i
see
to
protect
these
other
women
working
now
the
language
in
proposition
k
is
farreaching
it
would
forbid
the
city
police
from
using
any
resources
to
investigate
or
prosecute
people
who
engage
in
prostitution
it
would
also
bar
financing
for
a
first
offender
program
for
prostitutes
and
their
clients
or
for
mandatory
reeducation
programs
one
of
the
measures
broadest
prohibitions
would
prevent
the
city
from
applying
for
federal
or
state
grants
that
use
racial
profiling
in
antiprostitution
efforts
an
apparent
reference
to
raids
seeking
illegal
immigrants
the
fight
over
the
ballot
initiative
has
become
an
awkward
test
of
san
franciscos
dual
attitudes
of
liveandletlive
and
savetheworld
in
the
campaigns
closing
days
the
rhetoric
on
both
sides
has
heated
up
supporters
of
the
measure
accuse
the
city
of
profiting
from
prostitution
through
fines
they
also
imply
that
laws
against
prostitution
are
inherently
racist
because
minorities
are
disproportionately
arrested
proposition
k
they
say
will
increase

for
women
save
taxpayer
money
and
cut
down
on
the
number
of
murders
of
prostitutes
at
the
hands
of
serial
killers
but
opponents
dismiss
the
notion
of
legions
of
prostitutes
happily
romping
through
the
citys
neighborhoods
this
isnt
pretty
woman
was
how
one
put
it
antiproposition
k
forces
paint
grim
pictures
of
girls
and
women
from
across
the
country
held
against
their
will
in
dark
and
dangerous
brothels
here
forced
into
unsafe
sexual
behavior
and
often
beaten
intimidated
and
raped
youre
going
to
have
young
girls
recruited
and
brought
to
san
francisco
and
they
are
going
to
be
standing
on
these
corners
said
norma
hotaling
the
founder
and
director
of
standing
against
global
exploitation
an
outreach
project
here
and
theres
not
going
to
be
any
services
for
them
to
go
to
and
the
police
are
not
going
to
have
any
means
of
investigating
the
cases
the
measure
seems
particularly
abhorrent
to
san
franciscos
district
attorney
kamala
d
harris
who
has
made
fighting
human
trafficking
a
priority
i
think
its
completely
ridiculous
just
in
case
theres
any
ambiguity
about
my
position
harris
said
it
would
put
a
welcome
mat
out
for
pimps
and
prostitutes
to
come
on
into
san
francisco
central
to
harris
objections
is
the
theory
that
prostitution
is
a
victimless
crime
instead
she
said
it
exposes
prostitutes
to
drug
gun
and
sexual
crimes
and
compromises
the
quality
of
life
in
a
community
she
also
dismisses
the
argument
that
prostitutes
would
be
more
likely
to
come
forward
if
their
business
were
not
illegal
were
in
the
practice
and
habit
of
protecting
victims
not
criminalizing
victims
harris
said
adding
that
she
often
reminds
juries
that
the
law
protects
people
even
if
they
are
prostitutes
or
drug
users
our
penal
code
was
not
created
just
to
protect
snow
white
she
said
noting
that
65
percent
of
cases
handled
by
her
departments
sexual
assault
unit
involved
sex
workers
as
victims
officials
with
the
state
attorney
generals
office
would
not
comment
on
the
measure
the
citys
board
of
supervisors
several
of
whom
have
expressed
support
for
the
measure
in
the
past
would
have
the
power
to
amend
proposition
k
if
it
passed
san
francisco
which
has
an
exotic
dancers
union
and
a
wellestablished
history
of
sexual
freedom
is
not
the
first
liberal
outpost
to
mull
legalizing
prostitution
a
decriminalization
bill
was
defeated
by
voters
in
berkeley
calif
in
2004
heidi
machen
a
spokeswoman
for
the
opposition
said
her
side
was
hoping
for
a
solid
defeat
we
want
this
to
fail
by
a
landslide
she
said
so
it
doesnt
come
back
a
local
cbs
poll
released
thursday
found
that
35
percent
of
likely
voters
supported
the
measure
while
39
percent
were
opposed
but
26
percent
were
still
undecided
on
thursday
night
about
50
supporters
of
the
measure
gathered
at
a
church
to
press
their
case
one
of
them
patricia
west
22
said
she
has
been
working
for
about
a
year
as
an
independent
incall
escort
west
said
that
she
enjoyed
her
work
and
believed
that
proposition
k
would
allow
prostitutes
to
organize
into
collectives
and
negotiate
for
safer
working
conditions
and
better
wages
west
concedes
that
what
she
does
for
a
living
can
be
dangerous
but
she
hoped
proposition
k
would
make
her
occupation
safer
and
more
legitimate
working
in
a
coal
mine
can
be
really
dangerous
too
she
said
but
it
pays
a
lot
of
money
so
youre
compensated
for
your
risk
lightning
coach
barry
melrose
knows
exactly
how
the
media
game
is
played
twelve
years
as
an
analyst
for
espn
provides
such
insight
so
when
reporters
took
shots
at
his
team
for
its
stumbling
start
melrose
reminded
it
was
early
when
columnists
speculated
his
job
already
is
in
jeopardy
sports
illustrated
incorrectly
predicted
he
would
be
the
first
coach
fired
he
shrugged
thats
their
job
melrose
said
i
know
all
those
guys
when
we
win
a
couple
ill
be
the
greatest
coach
in
the
world
so
i
dont
worry
about
stuff
like
that
if
you
worry
about
stuff
like
that
you
shouldnt
be
in
the
business
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
coach
with
a
shorter
honeymoon
chicagos
denis
savard
was
canned
after
four
games
but
that
was
the
final
act
of
a
scripted
drama
melrose
is
a
new
hire
in
a
situation
that
screams
for
patience
15
new
players
learning
a
new
system
while
their
coach
out
of
the
game
since
he
was
fired
by
the
kings
in
april
1995
tries
to
reestablish
his
credibility
and
that
of
a
team
that
last
season
was
the
leagues
worst
but
given
the
money
owners
oren
koules
and
len
barrie
have
put
into
the
roster
even
melrose
said
i
dont
think
we
have
a
year
im
under
no
illusion
i
have
a
fiveyear
plan
if
there
is
a
timetable
general
manager
brian
lawton
isnt
saying
were
still
in
the
earliest
stages
of
evaluation
he
said
of
a
process
he
stressed
is
focused
on
the
entire
team
we
expect
a
lot
from
our
players
we
expect
a
lot
from
our
coaches
so
thus
my
comments
would
be
we
still
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
were
not
where
we
want
to
be
or
expect
to
be
but
heading
into
tonights
game
with
the
senators
at
the
st
pete
times
forum
things
are
better
tampa
bay
333
has
won
two
straight
and
three
of
four
and
thursday
dominated
the
thennortheastleading
sabres
52
in
buffalo
the
guys
better
know
their
roles
now
and
understand
what
its
going
to
take
for
us
to
be
a
good
team
and
a
lot
of
that
has
to
do
with
him
left
wing
mark
recchi
said
of
melrose
has
everyone
done
the
right
things
no
we
havent
as
players
but
he
cares
hes
passionate
about
it
and
wants
us
to
do
the
right
things
recchi
said
that
melrose
had
instant
credibility
with
the
players
because
he
is
a
hockey
person
and
we
know
hes
a
good
coach
so
he
had
respect
coming
in
melrose
52
said
the
only
way
for
him
to
earn
selfrespect
was
to
get
behind
the
bench
if
i
wouldnt
have
taken
the
job
i
would
have
been
a
hypocrite
melrose
said
im
sitting
up
there
at
espn
and
criticizing
other
people
and
talking
stuff
and
if
you
have
a
chance
to
get
back
in
the
fight
and
dont
take
it
i
would
have
been
very
disappointed
in
myself
for
not
having
the
courage
to
do
that
asked
if
coaching
is
different
from
when
he
led
the
wayne
gretzky
kings
to
the
1993
stanley
cup
final
melrose
dragged
out
what
he
admits
is
an
old
line
that
exaggerates
to
make
a
point
the
kings
he
said
had
three
players
who
were
millionaires
now
i
have
three
who
arent
seriously
have
new
defensive
strategies
and
antiobstruction
rules
made
it
a
different
game
thats
the
easy
answer
he
said
but
the
good
teams
still
win
with
character
they
still
win
with
competition
they
still
outwork
you
goaltending
is
still
the
most
important
position
of
any
position
in
sports
and
hockey
is
still
a
game
of
passion
and
itoldyousos
shortly
after
beating
the
sabres
melrose
was
asked
if
the
lightnings
twogame
winning
streak
qualified
him
as
a
genius
no
just
smart
he
said
for
a
genius
you
have
to
win

a

with

it
was
demps
who
intrigued
coach
urban
meyer
most
he
thought
with
time
lots
of
time
the
young
man
from
south
lake
high
in
groveland
could
be
a
great
player
at
florida
but
running
backs
coach
kenny
carter
saw
things
a
little
differently
during
his
first
full
meeting
with
demps
who
arrived
on
campus
in
july
the
veteran
assistant
sensed
quick
impact
potential

and
ill
tell
you
why
carter
said
emphatically
the
first
time
i
got
a
chance
to
sit
down
with
him
and
talk
about
our
passprotection
scheme
and
the
things
that
we
do
he
understood
it
and
could
spit
it
back
at
me
immediately
when
he
did
that
i
was
a
happy
man
because
i
knew
that
if
he
could
do
that
he
was
ready
that
was
right
when
we
started
being
able
to
do
football
stuff
he
just
took
off
and
could
do
it
all
so
we
were
really
excited
about
that
along
with
excitement
demps
and
rainey
have
brought
a
legitimate
running
game
to
the
gators
something
meyer
didnt
have
in
his
previous
three
years
at
florida
outside
of
wide

percy
harvin
gators
running
backs
have
accounted

896
yards
on

and
10

they
totaled
761
yards
on
136

last
season
demps
and
rainey
emerged
after
the
loss
to
ole
miss
in
which
senior
moore
and
transfer
moody
were
injured
in
the
past
three
games
demps
and
rainey
have
carried
52
times
for
487
yards
and
four
rushing

can
just
trying

do
whatever
i
can
to

my

the
softspoken
demps
said
i
still
have
a
lot
to
learn
in
the
arkansas
game
oct

the

set

176

and
rainey

185
the
two
pose
a
threat
because
of
their
speed
demps
has
run
100
meters
in
1001
seconds
and
just
missed
qualifying
for
the
final
at
the
olympic
trials
this
year
rainey
has
run
sub44
for
40
yards
and
1023
in
the
100
demps
is
more
tough
to
defend
in
the
speedoption
because
once
he
breaks
free
he
has
the
potential
to
make
huge
gains
the
option
allows
me
to
get
into
space
and
when
i
get
into
space
i
can
do
a
lot
of
things
and
get
upfield
he
said
when
you
get
the
pitch
youre
looking
at
your
blocker
first
just
trying
to
make
a
read
off
the
block
once
you
get
past
the
block
you
start
looking
downfield
meyer
said
when
he
sees
demps
or
rainey
break
free
out
of
the
backfield
i
become
like
a
fan
its
a
beautiful
thing
to
watch
its
also
a
tremendous
help
to
quarterback
tim
tebow
broadening
the
offensive
game
plan
having
them
in
the
game
just
opens
things
up
the
junior
said
their
speed
allows
them
to
get
to
the
edge
we
can
put
them
in
open
space
to
try
to
create
oneonone
matchups
they
are
so
fast
and
athletic
we
can
stretch
the
field
horizontally
in
the
first
seven
games
demps
has
averaged
121
yards
every
time
he
touches
the
ball
rainey
68
and
according
to
carter
their
potential
is
limitless
i
told
jeff
and
chris
this
week
they
have
kind
of
a
tigerwoodish
deal
carter
said
because
they
are
so
fast
they
are
at
another
level
than
everybody
else
so
if
they
play
at
their
level
they
can
really
do
some
great
things
but
if
they
dont
play
at
their
level
then
they
are
just
average
in
a
game
in
which
teams
are
so
evenly
matched
having
the
duo
play
at
their
level
could
be
the
difference
between
winning

as
the
government
makes
taxpayer
funds
available
to
banks
weakened
by
the
financial
crisis
the
criteria
being
used
to
choose
who
gets
money
appears
to
be
setting
the
stage
for
consolidation
in
the
industry
by
favoring
those
most
likely
to
survive
but
while
the
measures
closely
guarded
by
treasury
department
officials
accommodate
banks
with
top
safety
and
soundness
ratings
they
also
allow
the
government
to
apply
a
looser
definition
to
some
banks
with
lower
ratings
according
to
two
people
briefed
on
the
process
some
of
those
banks
may
have
lost
money
over
the
past
year
however
and
should
they
fail
the
taxpayers
investment
would
be
wiped
out
analysts
said
that
giving
capital
to
such
weaker
banks
could
run
against
the
spirit
of

more
than
38

in

the

is
concerned
that

its
selection
criteria
would
lead
to
speculation
about
which
small
and
mediumsize
banks
may
not
be
qualified
to
receive
the

said
the
people
with
knowledge
of
the
process
some
lawmakers
are
upset
that
the
capitalization
program
which
the
government
described
as
a
way
to
jumpstart
lending
will
end
up
culling
banks
in
their
districts

of

based
on

system
they

gauge

financial

health
these
yardsticks
known
as

ratings
classify
the

8500

into
five
categories
where
a
ranking
of
1
applies
to
those
in

and
a
5
to
those
in

worst
under

banks
with
a
rating
of

are
essentially
guaranteed
to
qualify
for
the

according
to
the
people
briefed
on

process
those
in

are
unlikely
to

of

over
the
last
year
are
the
most
likely
to
receive
capital
banks
that
have
lost
money
over
the
last
year
however
must
pass
additional
tests
federal
banking
regulators
are
also
applying
additional
criteria
like
assurances
that
banks
are
lending
in
lowincome
communities
to
determine
eligibility
they
are
also
asking
if
a
bank
has
enough
capital
and
reserves
to
withstand
severe
losses
to
its
construction
loan
portfolio
nonperforming
loans
and
other
troubled
assets
banks
that
fail
to
meet
two
of
the
guidelines
are
unlikely
to
receive
the
money
said
a
person
with
indirect
knowledge
of
the
process
but
banks
that
have
only
one
strike
against
them
can
lobby
regulators
for
the
cash
several
advisers
to
financial
institutions
also
said
that
they
were
aware
of
banks
that
received
capital
with
the
understanding
the
banks
would
try
to
find
a
merger
partner
they
said
other
banks
were
urged
to
slash
their
dividend
if
they
sought
cash
the
advisers
were
not
authorized
by
their
clients
to
speak
and
did
not
name
the
banks
both
actions
suggest
that
the
government
may
be
loosely
defining
what
constitutes
healthy
institutions
banks
are
required
to
provide
a
specific
business
plan
for
the
next
two
or
three
years
and
explain
how
they
plan
to
deploy
the
capital
regulators
however
say
that
they
will
not
examine
how
the
financial
institutions
actually
use
the
cash
there
is
no
express
statutory
requirement
that
says
you
must
make
this
amount
of
loans
john
c
dugan
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
one
of
the
major
banking
regulators
said
in
a
recent
interview
but
the
economics
work
so
that
it
is
in
their
interest
to
do
so
and
that
their
actions
would
be
open
to
the
court
of
public
opinion
still
many
lawmakers
are
concerned
that
some
banks
appear
to
be
holding
on
to
the
capital
instead
of
immediately
making
loans
to
spur
economic
growth
any
use
of
these
funds
for
any
purpose
other
than
lending

for
bonuses
for
severance
pay
for
dividends
for
acquisitions
of
other
institutions
etc

is
a
violation
of
the
act
rep
barney
frank
dmass
chairman
of
the
house
financial
services
committee
said
in
a
statement
on
friday
justice
antonin
scalia
has
a
reputation
as
an
intimidating
jurist
who
poses
withering
questions
during
arguments
before
the
supreme
court
but
on
friday
afternoon
when
the
soprano
leontyne
price
entered
the
west
conference
room
at
the
court
to
attend
an
honorary
luncheon
hosted
by
the
national
endowment
for
the
arts
scalia
an
avid
opera
fan
visibly
melted
its
a
great
honor
to
meet
you
he
told
price
his
face
crinkling
with
warmth
and
delight
when
price
complimented
him
on
the
elegance
of
the
luncheons
setting

a
paneled
salon
its
walls
lined
with
portraits
of
past
chief
justices

he
replied
yes
these
are
pretty
nice
rooms
adding
and
theyre
yours
today
there
had
been
a
similar
greeting
moments
earlier
when
before
the
luncheon
price
entered
the
chamber
of
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
another
passionate
and
highly
informed
opera
buff
when
the
justice
opened
the
doors
to
her
office
price
who
at
81
seemed
ever
the
prima
donna
knelt
on
one
knee
before
her
it
was
a
gesture
price
mastered
decades
ago
when
she
would
appear
before
the
curtain
to
thank
audiences
for
their
ovations
what
a
joy
ginsburg
said
beaming
and
taking
prices
hand
my
this
magnificent
woman
the
occasion
was
the
inauguration
of
a
series
of
awards
from
the
endowment
acknowledging
lasting
contributions
to
opera
called
the
nea
opera
honors
they
are
the
first
new
awards
from
the
federal
government
for
individual
achievement
in
the
arts
in
26
years
along
with
price
the
other
honorees
in
this
first
year
are
the
conductor
james
levine
the
composer
carlisle
floyd
best
known
for
his
operas
susannah
and
of
mice
and
men
which
have
become
repertory
works
and
the
englishborn
impresario
richard
gaddes
who
has
had
long
and
pivotal
tenures
directing
the
opera
theater
of
st
louis
and
the
santa
fe
opera
where
he
recently
stepped
down
as
general
director
the
day
represented
a
meeting
of
art
and
justice
said
dana
gioia
the
chairman
of
the
endowment
in
welcoming
the
honorees
their
guests
and
other
invitees
to
the
luncheon
the
endowment
has
come
under
criticism
in
recent
years
by
legislators
who
seek
to
influence
its
policies
and
priorities
and
its
budget
which
last
year
was
148
million
has
risen
and
fallen
with
the
times
in
a
brief
interview
gioia
said
he
hoped
that
the
strong
public
reception
to
these
awards
would
be
seen
as
an
expression
of
the
regard
in
which
the
nea
is
still
held
perhaps
the
most
fascinating
aspects
of
the
luncheon
were
the
revealing
glimpses
of
the
justices
as
smitten
buffs
gioia
invited
the
courts
opera
lovers

scalia
ginsburg
and
justice
anthony
m
kennedy

to
serve
as
hosts
for
the
luncheon
all
three
readily
accepted
as
ginsburg
said
in
welcoming
the
guests
when
dana
gioia
asked
us
i
took
a
cue
from
nancy
reagan
and
just
said
may
we
great
sopranos
have
long
dominated
the
opera
world
and
price
was
the
center
of
attention
on
this
day
touring
ginsburgs
temporary
chambers
the

permanent
offices

price
accompanied
by
her
younger
brother
george
price
a
retired
united
states
army
general
was
visibly
overcome
what
would
our
parents
say
she
asked
her
brother
thinking
of
their
origins
in
laurel
miss
where
her
mother
was
a
midwife
and
her
father
a
handyman
ginsburg
75
told
price
that
she
and
her
husband
prof
martin
d
ginsburg
who
also
attended
the
luncheon
were
in
the
audience
when
price
made
her
sensational
metropolitan
opera
debut
on
jan
27
1961
as
leonora
in
verdis
trovatore
the
same
night
that
the
renowned
tenor
franco
corelli
made
his
met
debut
as
manrico
it
was
a
trovatore
like
no
other
we
have
ever
attended
she
said
ginsburg
said
she
remembered
very
clearly
that
before
one
of
the
acts
prices
parents
proudly
sitting
in
a
box
at
the
met
were
introduced
and
a
spotlight
shone
on
them
im
not
going
to
cry
price
said
though
my
mascara
is
starting
to
run
ginsburg
showed
price
a
cabinet
lined
with
photographs
of
herself
standing
with
opera
singers
she
admires
including
luciano
pavarotti
renee
fleming
and
denyce
graves
maybe
before
the
day
is
out
ill
have
a
photo
with
you
she
said
the
only
honoree
missing
from
the
luncheon
was
levine
who
spent
friday
afternoon
in
rehearsals
for
the
mets
new
production
of
berliozs
damnation
of
faust
which
opens
friday
in
addition
illness
forced
him
to
miss
the
formal
awards
ceremony
and
concert
on
friday
evening
with
placido
domingo
and
israel
gursky
conducting
vocalists
and
the
orchestra
of
the
washington
national
opera
at
the
harman
center
for
the
arts
as
ginsburg
and
scalia
chatted
before
lunch
they
recalled
a
disagreement
about
the
washington
national
operas
muchdebated
production
of
puccinis
boheme
which
opened
the
season
a
year
ago
the
director
mariusz
trelinski
had
boldly
updated
and
contemporized
the
opera
and
ginsburg
did
not
like
it
she
said
frowning
ruth
is
a
harsh
opera
critic
scalia
said
im
supposed
to
be
the
stodgy
one
but
i
loved
it
scalia
72
grew
up
in
queens
an
only
child
of
musicloving
parents
my
father
gave
me
piano
lessons
until
i
was
a
junior
in
high
school
he
said
i
used
to
be
pretty
good
his
love
of
opera
started
in
his
youth
when
his
father
a
professor
at
brooklyn
college
took
him
to
the
college
theater
to
see
a
production
of
puccinis
gianni
schicchi
in
retrospect
that
opera
could
be
seen
as
a
fitting
choice
for
a
future
jurist
set
in
renaissance
italy
it
is
a
comedy
about
a
falsified
will
i
loved
gianni
schicchi
and
i
still
love
it
scalia
said
breaking
into
a
smile
in
her
welcoming
remarks
at
the
luncheon
ginsburg
also
singled
out
the
contributions
of
the
other
honorees
she
said
she
had
been
moved
deeply
by
the
washington
national
operas
productions
of
floyds
susannah
and
of
mice
and
men
and
she
has
long
been
a
fan
of
gaddes
work
at
the
santa
fe
opera
ive
been
going
every
summer
she
said
once
i
discovered
the
santa
fe
opera
i
stopped
going
to
salzburg
and
glyndebourne
during
the
meal
an
unexpected
pleasure
quieted

at

then
nearly
in

a

on
friday
life
could
not
possibly
be

her

a

of
scissors
to

chest

the

she

fans
here
had
waited
25
years
for
a
championship
parade
down
broad
street
the
phillies
gave
them
one
friday
and
so
many
fans
showed
up
that
they
nearly
shut
down
the
city
when
the
phillies
defeated
the
tampa
bay
rays
on
wednesday
night
to
capture
the
world
series
title
they
delivered
this
city
its
first
major
sports
championship
since
1983
when
the
76ers
won
the
nba
finals
the
phillies
only
other
title
came
in
1980
the
parade
started
in
center
city
passed
city
hall
and
traveled
nearly
four
miles
south
to
the
phillies
home
field
citizens
bank
park
it
started
at
noon
and
crawled
at
a
speed
of
about
4
miles
per
hour
arriving
in
south
philadelphia
more
than
an
hour
later
than
expected
about
3
pm
the
police
and
city
officials
estimated
that
more
than
a
million
fans
packed
the
route
and
the
crowds
overwhelmed
the
public
transit
system
septa
which
runs
the
citys
subway
system
and
regional
rail
lines
temporarily
shut
down
the
broad
street
line
which
connects
center
city
to
the
sports
complex
area
the
patco
highspeed
line
which
runs
to
new
jersey
was
also
jammed
some
fans
chose
to
walk
home
instead
of
waiting
for
trains
at
times
mayor
michael
a
nutter
and
phillies
manager
charlie
manuel
held
up
the
world

trophy
while
players
waved
to
fans
left
fielder
pat
burrell
led
the
procession
in
a
horsedrawn
carriage
which
was
followed
by
flatbed
trucks
filled
with
players
and
other
members
of
the
organization
center
fielder
shane
victorino
tossed
soft
pretzels
to
the
crowd
and
shortstop
jimmy
rollins
turned
his
video
camera
on
the
fans
the
phillies
then
greeted
tens
of
thousands
of
fans
who
had
watched
the
parade
on
big
screens
at
the
citys
baseball
and
football
stadiums
the
team
first
stopped
at
lincoln
financial
field
where
the
eagles
play
this
is
the
biggest
parade
ive
ever
been
in
manuel
told
the
fans
its
like
christmas
came
two
months
early
the
phillies
then
headed
to
citizens
bank
park
where
a
red
2008
banner
was
raised
to
celebrate
their
world
series
title
the
clear
sky
and
a
60degree
temperature
was
a
contrast
to
the
cold
windy
and
rainy
conditions
that
forced
the
suspension
of
game
5
on
monday
and
prevented
the
game
from
being
completed
until
wednesday
fans
packed
sidewalks
climbed
trees
hung
out
of
windows
watched
from
balconies
and
stood
on
roofs
for
a
better
view
rich
and
michelle
boyle
of
archbald
pa
both
39
stayed
overnight
in
center
city
so
they
could
take
their
two
sons
10yearold
rj
and
6yearold
jeremy
to
the
parade
they
secured
a
spot
along
market
street
near
the
start
of
route
were
diehard
phillies
fans
so
we
had
to
let
them
come
and
see
their
first
parade
hopefully
not
their
last
rich
boyle
said
i
didnt
go
to
the
last
one
my
dad
said
i
had
to
wait
until
i
was
old
enough
i
talked
to
him
last
night
and
he
said
i
was
old
enough
to
go
now
rj
was
missing
a
halloween
parade
but
he
said
id
rather
be
here
he
dressed
as
a
phillies
player
and
his
brother
wore
a
green
jersey
for
his
costume
as
an
eagles
football
player
carol
golden
47
and
david
golden
43
of
cherry
hill
nj
also
let
their
sons
skip
school
theyll
get
a
lot
more
education
out
of
this
than
if
they
were
in
school
david
golden
said
the
parade
drew
fans
from
beyond
the
region
too
greg
packer
44
of
huntington
ny
drove
in
for
game
5
of
the
world
series
and
stayed
for
the
celebration
he
arrived
on
broad
street
near
city
hall
at
5
am
to
secure
what
he
considered
the
best
spot
in
new
york
right
now
we
have
no
mets
no
yankees
no
stadiums
he
said
i
came
here
to
represent
and
cheer
our
neighbors
early
in
the
giants
workout
on
friday
much
of
the
wire
fence
around
their
practice
field
was
without
the
usual
blue
plastic
sheets
anyone
could
peer
through
it
spies
from
the
dallas
cowboys
could
have
discovered
secret
plays
to
be
honest
with
you
i
didnt
even
notice
it
coach
tom
coughlin
said
of
the
seethrough
barrier
they
are
supposed
to
be
covered
all
of
the
time
anyway
so
if
it
was
uncovered
then
somehow
some
way
something
happened
there
by
the
time
practice
ended
the
sheets
were
back
in
place
but
it
is
doubtful
that
the
cowboys
could
have
learned
much
of
anything
before
the
national
football
conference
east
rivals
meet
sunday
at
giants
stadium
these
teams
already
know
each
other
too
well
the
giants
61
played
the
cowboys
53
three
times
last
season
and
92
times
since
1960
when
the
cowboys
joined
the
nfl
dallas
won
both
regularseason
games
in
2007
but
the
giants
beat
the
favored
cowboys
in
the
playoffs
en
route
to
the
super
bowl
title
this
game
is
one
of
the
best
this
weekend
entering
the
season
the
cowboys
were
the
trendy
pick
to
win
the
championship
some
giants
resented
that
others
laughed
it
off
like
i
said
in
training
camp
everybody
crowned
certain
people
plaxico
burress
said
you
still
have
to
line
up
and
go
play
i
have
seen
a
lot
of
crazy
things
happen
in
this
league
dallas
has
been
weakened
by
injuries
among
the
wounded
is
quarterback
tony
romo
out
for
a
third
consecutive
game
with
a
broken
finger
and
tight
end
jason
witten
questionable
with
a
broken
rib
antonio
pierce
a
middle
linebacker
assessed
these
factors
as
the
giants
reached
the
midseason
mark
they
are
still
the
dallas
cowboys
pierce
said
everybody
hates
everybody
in
this
league
this
rivalry
has
gotten
even
more
intense
they
have
been
titled
americas
team
and
they
are
coming
to
the
big
apple
so
it
should
be
fun
romo
could
be
back
for
dallas
next
game
in
his
place
sunday
the
cowboys
will
again
use
40yearold
brad
johnson
playing
with
his
fifth
team
in
his
17th
season
on
defense
dallas
will
be
without
cornerback
terence
newman
sports
hernia
and
cornerback
adam
jones
formerly
pacman
who
is
in
alcohol
rehabilitation
cornerback
anthony
henry
thigh
injury
is
probable
the
depleted
secondary
should
be
tested
by
eli
manning
and
his
receivers
we
can
try
to
throw
the
ball
downfield
but
it
is
always
a
battle
manning
said
we
know
each
other
very
well
manning
will
be
pursued
by
linebacker
demarcus
ware
who
leads
the
cowboys
in
sacks
with
nine
the
dallas
offense
is
bolstered
by
running
back
marion
barber
who
has
153
carries
for
611
yards
and
five
touchdowns
if
johnson
can
find
them
his
receivers
include
terrell
owens
and
roy
williams
recently
acquired
from
detroit
but
owens
has
only
13
catches
for
167
yards
and
a
touchdown
in
the
last
four
games
his
relative
drought
began
before
romo
was
injured
it
is
frustrating
owens
said
in
a
video
clip
on
nflcom
youve
got
to
have
faith
there
were
some
oneonone
opportunities
last
game
we
just
didnt
connect
the
giants
have
many
tools
including
a
sack
attack
that
leads
the
league
with
26
and
a
rushing
attack
that
leads
the
league
in
yards
per
game
with
1573
the
team
also
leads
the
league
in
a
category
most
would
not
guess

safeties
with
two
in
the
last
two
games
victories
against
san
francisco
and
pittsburgh
the
giants
have
scored
on
these
rare
plays
even
the
word
itself
is
versatile
in
this
sport
it
applies
to
two
defensive
positions
free
and
strong
and
it
also
applies
to
the
general
health
of
a
team
avoiding
injuries
coughlin
smiled
when
asked
about
the
twogame
streak
of
2point
safeties
what
do
i
think
of
them
he
said
i
hope
they
work
for
us
indeed
in
pro
football
you
can
never
be
too
safe
that
is
why
coaches
want
their
fences
covered
on
their
practice
fields
to
play
it
safe

what
looked
implausible
in
june
but
practically
guaranteed
in
september
happened
friday
when
the
mets
exercised
their
12
million
option
on
carlos
delgado
given
that
the
mets
were
already
committed
to
giving
him
a
4
million
buyout
if
they
had
not
picked
up
his
option
paying
delgado
an
extra
8
million
could
be
a
bargain
if
he
can
come
close
to
duplicating
his
secondhalf
surge
carlos
is
a
key
part
of
our
plans
for
2009
and
we
wanted
to
let
him
know
as
quickly
as
allowed
that
we
wanted
him
back
general
manager
omar
minaya
said
in
a
statement
yesterday

the
day
following
the
conclusion
of
the
world
series

was
the
first
day
that
we
could
pick
up
the
option
per
the
contract
it
was
our
full
intent
to
promptly
close
our
deal
with
carlos
and
thats
what
we
did
delgado
36
rebounded
from
a
miserable
first
three
months

he
was
batting
228
through
the
end
of
june

to
hit
271
with
a
teamhigh
38
home
runs
and
115
runs
batted
in
his
best
statistical
season
of
his
three
with
the
team
after
july
1
he
batted
313
with
24
homers
70
rbis
and
a
617
slugging
percentage
only
two
players
in
each
of
the
last
three
categories
had
higher
marks
than
delgado
over
that
span
delgados
defense
never
an
asset
also
seemed
to
improve
as
his
production
increased
with
delgados
value
at
its
peak
and
given
that
he
plans
to
play
a
few
more
seasons
he
is
31
homers
shy
of
500
the
mets
are
not
necessarily
wedded
to
having
him
on
first
base
next
season
although
it
is
not
a
priority
the
mets
may
explore
dealing
him
to
the
american
league
where
he
could
serve
as
a
designated
hitter
such
a
deal
could
shore
up
the
mets
relief
corps
and
starting
rotation
although
they
still
intend
to
pursue
at
least
one
starter
and
a
closer
and
perhaps
a
second
baseman
on
the
freeagent
market
the
mets
seem
more
likely
to
fill
most
of
their
needs
via
trades
nadine
mcneil
will
reach
the
crest
of
the
verrazanonarrows
bridge
on
her
handcycle
soon
after
730
sunday
morning
moments
later
she
will
roll
swiftly
past
her
18yearold
son
tyler
who
is
autistic
this
will
be
her
fourth
marathon
and
tylers
first
she
has
grown
uneasy
this
week
thinking
of
the
moment
when
she
will
leave
him
behind
i
cant
look
back
she
said
for
18
years
ive
always
known
every
moment
where
tyler
is
on
sunday
i
wont
though
joint
parentchild
appearances
in
the
new

marathon
are
not
uncommon

rod
dixon
the
races
1983
champion
is
returning
this
year
to
run
the
race
with
his
daughter

the
path
that
brought
nadine
42
and
tyler
to
the
marathon
is
an
unlikely
one
nadine
had
a
stroke
when
she
was
8
and
lost
the
use
of
her
right
arm
and
her
right
leg
tyler
her
only
child
is
severely
speechdelayed
even
now
at
6
feet
4
inches
he
communicates
verbally
by
using
one
or
two
words
at
a
time
nadine
has
poured
her
life
into
her
son
tyler
in
turn
is
what
she
calls
my
right
arm
he
compensates
for
her
disabilities
by
tying
her
shoes
he
does
her
buttons
and
zippers
if
she
tries
to
put
on
her
coat
he
will
immediately
rush
to
her
side
and
gently
lift
her
right
arm
into
the
sleeve
neither
would
have
ever
made
it
to
this
years
starting
line
without
the
other
their
path
to
the
marathon
began
when
tyler
was
7
nadine
arrived
with
her
son
at
hunter
college
to
see
the
director
of
project
happy
a
program
that
provides
athletic
and
recreational
activities
to
new
york
city
youth
with
disabilities
nadine
was
by
then
a
single
mother
living
in
the
bronx
she
had
already
been
turned
away
from
athletic
programs
at
the
bronx
y
the
92nd
street
y
and
the
53rd
street
y
because
of
tylers
tantrums
and
other
behavior
he
came
in
with
his
mother
said
penny
shaw
the
71yearold
director
of
project
happy
he
had
no
language
he
did
nothing
but
scream
we
had
never
seen
a
child
like
that
and
we
certainly
had
never
taken
one
into
the
program
but
the
mother
was
so
nice
i
said
we
would
try
soon
after
tyler
enrolled
shaw
and
her
staff
recognized
that
he
was
a
natural
athlete
when
he
picked
up
a
basketball
he
would
throw
it
in
the
hoop
with
almost
mathematical
precision
nadine
had
also
started
taking
tyler
to
achilles
kids
a
running
and
rolling
program
for
children
with
disabilities
to
get
him
to
events
she
had
to
leave
the
bronx
for
manhattan
at
530
am
tylers
behavior
began
to
improve
during
his
involvement
in
achilles
kids
and
project
happy
he
has
since
won
dozens
of
medals
in
the
special
olympics
particularly
in
swimming
this
child
was
saved
by
sports
shaw
said
nadine
had
never
considered
that
athletics
could
serve
a
similar
role
in
her
own
life
at
achilles
kids
she
would
guard
the
bags
and
the
coats
while
tyler
ran
one
day
in
august
2006
dick
traum
an
amputee
who
founded
the
achilles
adult
program
mentioned
to
nadine
that
she
should
consider
racing
in
a
marathon
i
laughed
nadine
said
he
said
i
could
do
it
in
a
handcycle
i
was
like
dick
my
right
arm
three
months
later
in
november
2006
nadine
found
herself
at
the
starting
line
in
staten
island
she
had
attached
her
paralyzed
right
arm
to
the
handcycles
pedal
mechanism
with
duct
tape
from
home
depot
she
powered
the
chair
with
her
left
arm
and
finished
the
marathon
in
4
hours
3
minutes
as
nadine
trained
for
more
races
tyler
would
jog
by
her
wheelchair
nadine
began
to
notice
a
difference
in
her
supposedly
frozen
arm
it
had
gained
some
power
and
even
some
range
of
motion
her
doctor
noticed
too
it
has
become
much
stronger
in
just
the
past
year
with
all
the
practice
shes
had
said
regina
coyne
nadines
general
practitioner
last
november
tyler
became
confused
when
nadine
boarded
the
bus
to
travel
to
the
marathon
starting
line
he
wanted
to
go
with
her
his
mother
persuaded
him
to
let
her
go
by
saying
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
run
the
race
until
he
was
18
after
tyler
turned
18
in
july
nadine
took
him
to
his
doctor
who
performed
an
ekg
and
said
tyler
was
physically
capable
tylers
school
for

in

held
a
pep
rally
for
him
wednesday
he
marched
around
the
seating
bowl
of
the
auditorium
while
holding
an
american
flag
and
his
fellow
students

some
of
them
holding

sang

of

of

we
will
rock
you
and
we
are

one
of
tylers
friends
sean
19
who
is
also
autistic
took
the
microphone
and
said
solemnly
tyler
i
have
two
words
to
say
to
you
good
luck
at
the
marathon
and
i
love
you
tyler
will
run
the
race
with
one
of
his
specialeducation
teachers
vinny
bruno
his
mother
has
decided
not
to
try
to
slow
her
chair
and
ride
beside
him
after
18
years
she
wants
to
allow
him
to
become
more
independent

a
shift
that
is
as
difficult
for
her
as
for
him
she
thinks
back
to
when
he
was
3
and
the
doctors
suggested
that
he
would
never
even
be
toilet
trained
let
alone
be
an
athlete
she
has
had
trouble
sleeping
this
week
mostly
because
she
knows
him
so
well
hes
going
to
try
his
hardest
to
get
to
that
finish
line
whether
it
hurts
whether
it
drives
him
nuts
she
said
hes
going
to
keep
coming
until
he
sees
me
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
free
lunch

or
at
least
a
free
recipe

but
the
founders
of
cookstr
a
new
web
site
do
hope
that
home
cooks
will
eventually
pay
although
the
internet
is
already
flooded
with
recipes
will
schwalbe
who
stepped
down
as
editor
in
chief
of
hyperion
books
in
january
is
starting
cookstr
to
showcase
the
recipes
of
star
chefs
like
jamie
oliver
nigella
lawson
and
mario
batali
as
well
as
those
of
lesswellknown
but
highly
regarded
cookbook
writers
the
idea
ultimately
is
to
sell
copies
of
these
authors
books
on
the
site
wwwcookstrcom
which
goes
live
this
month
each
recipe
will
appear
on
a
page
with
a
prominently
placed
picture
of
the
source
cookbooks
cover
as
well
as
a
link
to
one
of
four
online
retailers
selling
the
book
most
people
who
want
to
cook
at
home
eventually
look
up
a
recipe
online
according
to
comscore
an
internet
marketing
research
company
food
sites
attracted
456
million
unique
visitors
in
september
up
10
percent
from
a
year
ago
more
than
double
the
rate
of
total
internet
growth
in
the
united
states
at
the
same
time
the
internet
is
shaking
up
the
publishing
industry
as
authors
in
all
genres
debate
whether
giving
away
content
generates
or
diminishes
sales
in
some
respects
cookbooks
would
seem
particularly
vulnerable
because
recipes
are
selfcontained
in
a
way
that
a
chapter
of
a
novel
is
not
but
schwalbe

along
with
more
than
a
dozen
publishers
and
100
cookbook
authors
who
have
signed
up
to
contribute
recipes
to
the
site

believes
that
a
carefully
chosen
selection
of
recipes
will
whet
the
appetites
of
prospective
cookbook
buyers
during
a
recent
interview
in
the
downtown
manhattan
offices
of
tipping

an
internet
startup
incubator
that
is
helping
to
get

going

pointed
to
the
examples
of
martha
stewart
and
rachael
ray
kitchen
queens
who
post
thousands
of
recipes
online
and
yet
remain
topselling
cookbook
writers
neither
is
contributing
to
cookstr
there
are
just
so
many
people
who
go
to
the
web
to
look
for
recipes
schwalbe
said
and
that
is
a
great
moment
to
remind
them
that
the
best
recipes
in
the
world
are
in
books
to
introduce
them
to
authors
they
might
not
know
about
cookbooks
remain
stalwart
performers
in
publishing
last
year
books
in
the
food
and
entertaining
category
sold
139
million
copies
though
that
was
down
from
149
million
a
year
earlier
according
to
nielsen
bookscan
which
tracks
about
70
percent
of
sales
so
far
this
year
cookbook
sales
are
slightly
up
before
accounting
for
the
crucial
forthcoming
holiday
season
many
authors
have
their
own
web
sites
and
there
are
dozens
of
other
sites
where
home
cooks
can
find
recipes
including
allrecipescom
epicuriouscom
and
foodnetworkcom
but
these
sites
tend
to
feature
recipes
contributed
by
users
or
those
that
have
appeared
in
food
magazines
the
foodnetworkcom
site
primarily
offers
recipes
of
the
cooks
who
appear
on
its
television
shows
cookstr
which
will
be
supported
by
advertising
revenues
will
aggregate
recipes
from
published
cookbooks
all
of
the
authors
will
have
their
own

with
biographies
links
to

and
in
the
case
of
restaurant
chefs
links
to
their

visitors
to

can
search
for

of

from
the
more
obvious

season
occasion

to
more
specialized
criteria
like

the

will
start
with
2500

likely
to

in

my

also
be

sites
are
ringing

asking

i
dont
ring
up
the

shop
and
ask
for
free

and
the
types
of

so
i
can
make
my

publishers
said
they
hoped
that
cookstr
could
help
draw
attention
not
only
to
new
books
but
also
to
older
titles
that
had
fallen
out
of
sight
the
reality
is
that
there
are
more
than
400
new
cookbooks
published
every
year
said
leslie
stoker
publisher
of
stewart
tabori
ampamp
chang
which
publishes
cookbooks
by
jacques
pepin
arthur
schwartz
and
alain
ducasse
so
bookstores
and
online
retailers
have
to
make
room
for
the
new
things
and
most
of
the
older
books
get
pushed
aside
schwalbe
will
be
asking
the
cooks
he
knows
best
like
lawson
a
british
television
personality
whose
books
include
how
to
eat
and
feast
food
to
celebrate
life
to
identify
authors
he
might
not
know
about
i
feel
television
only
gives
certain
people
prominence
lawson
said
in
a
telephone
interview
but
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
have
brilliant
recipes
who
dont
have
a
television
show
mollie
katzen
author
of
the
moosewood
cookbook
said
she
was
not
worried
about
the
sites
preempting
book
sales
theres
a
whole
lot
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
kind
of
presence
and
ambience
that
a
book
has
that
isnt
just
a
critical
mass
of
recipes
katzen
said
a
lot
of
the
feedback
that
people
have
given
me
on
my
books
is
that
they
like
to
curl
up
in
a

joan
nathan
the

of

cooking

and
the

said
she
suspected
that
the
current
ubiquity
of
recipes
online
had
diminished
sales
of
her
most
recent
book
but
she
hoped
cookstr
might
still
attract
new
buyers
who
knows
nathan
said
i
guess
i
hope
for
something
wonderful
the
worstcase
scenario
for
me
is
that

use

fierce

in
drafting

designed
to
end

and
harassment

by

the

quoting

reported
in

that
the
training
reforms
which
included
closer
supervision
by

had
worked
well
at
the
time
the
general
said
the
corps
would
not
ease
the
tough
physical
conditioning
that
was
a
hallmark
of

camps
but
he
demanded
that
there
be
no
more
excess
stress
on
recruits
including
nosetonose
yelling
by
drill
sergeants
barrow
also
succeeded
in
raising
the
quality
of

by
seeking

and
early
manhood
its
depiction
of
traditional
rural
life
and
of
violence

oppression

black
township
in
pretoria

the
experience
of
countless
thousands
of
his

ways

he

so

i
asked
myself

before
she
left
for
the
bangalore
airport
on
tuesday
susan
scottker
checked
the
mail
one
final
time
nothing
for
nearly
a
month
she
and
her
husband
had
been
waiting
for
their
new
york
state
absentee
ballots
to
arrive
in
india
where
she
has
been
working
since
the
summer
a
week
ago
they
realized
that
even
if
the
ballots
arrived
before
the
election

a
proposition
that
was
growing
more
dubious
by
the
minute

they
had
almost
no
chance
of
getting
them
back
in
time
to
be
counted
they
had
already
called
the
american
consulate
to
no
avail
and
had
looked
into
hiring
a
roundtrip
courier
service
we
had
a
long
talk
about
it
scottker
said
we
could
go
on
holiday
to
a
beach
somewhere
or
we
could
come
back
here
and
vote
it
was
a
long
talk
we
decided
it
was
important
to
stand
up
and
be
counted
we
bought
the
tickets
that
friday
the
24th
on
tuesday
evening
she
and
her
husband
caught
a
flight
from
bangalore
to
new
delhi
about
1100
miles
the
next
leg
of
the
journey
7500
miles
took
them
to
chicago
by
530
on
wednesday
morning
they
had
cleared
immigration
and
customs
at
ohare
international
airport
and
flew
the
last
700
miles
to
la
guardia
their
journey
of
9300
miles
had
taken
22
hours
it
is
possible
for
a
traveler
to
go
farther
in
one
direction
on
earth

but
not
much
when
all
their
expenses
are
counted
their
trip
will
have
cost
them
about
5000
scottker
said
experts
say
americans
are
showing
more
interest
and
passion
about
this
election
than
they
have
in
nearly
50
years
but
it
is
still
likely
that
onethird
of
the
eligible
voters
will
not
take
part

much
less
spend
two
full
days
traveling
around
the
world
to
do
so
for
scottker
45
a
native
of
new
zealand
and
her
husband
who
was
born
in
morocco
the
votes
they
intend
to
cast
on
tuesday
in
the
washington
heights
section
of
manhattan
will
be
their
first
ever
they
became
american
citizens
on
nov
30
2007
we
became
citizens
so
we
could
vote
scottker
said
wed
lived
here
13
years
on
green
cards
paid
lots
of
tax
money
but
you
have
no
voice
within
the
system
a
few
months
after
they
were
sworn
in
as
citizens
scottker
was
transferred
to
bangalore
by
her
employer
accenture
a
management
consulting
technology
and
outsourcing
company
as
its
marketing
director
for
india
she
kept
her
eye
on
the
election
filing
the
voter
registration
forms
in
august
and
getting
the
confirmation
in
early
october
then
she
discovered
that
an
absentee
ballot
would
require
a
separate
application
to
the
city
board
of
elections
in
this
highly
technological
age
and
city
do
we
need
to
be
mailing
applications
halfway
around
the
world
just
so
you
can
get
a
piece
of
mail
sent
back
to
the
same
place
scottker
wondered
aloud
in
a
word
yes
so
she
said
she
followed
the
requirements
to
the
letter
i
even
provided
an
addressed
envelope
for
the
ballot
to
be
sent
back
to
us
so
it
would
be
absolutely
perfect
as
it
would
have
to
have
been
for
the
india
postal
service
still
no
ballots
came
the
board
of
elections
in
manhattan

its
funding
cut
this
year
in
a
dispute
with
the
mayor

has
been
laggard
in
sending
out
absentee
ballots
officials
say
scottker
and
her
husband
a
university
instructor
knew
nothing
of
that
squabble
we
realized
were
not
going
to
get
to
vote
and
we
were
all
geared
up
to
do
this
she
said
we
thought
maybe
a
friend
could
get
the
ballots
for
us
in
manhattan
and
have
them
couriered
to
india
and
we
could
courier
them
back
there
were
so
many
ifs
and
buts
i
didnt
want
a
bureaucratic
process
to
get
in
the
way
of
casting
a
ballot
her
determination
is
clear
even
so
was
it
really
necessary
to
go
to
all
that
trouble
to
cast
votes
in
new
york
state
where
most
polls
give
the
democratic
ticket
a
lead
of
30
percent
or
more
then
youre
relying
on
other
people
to
do
your
job
she
said
apathy
doesnt
work
in
a
democracy
soon
after
she
got
home
she
heard
on
the
news
that
people
in
some
states
said
an
incorrect
vote
was
registered
when
they
used
a
touch
screen
in
early
voting
she
fretted
that
they
might
lose
their
votes
in
one
final
foulup
not
to
worry
she
was
told
the
voting
machines
in
new
york
have
been
around
since
at
least
the
early
1960s
and
are
in
no
immediate
danger
of
being
transformed
into
digital
touch
screens
i
was
looking
online
she
said
and
as
far
as
i
could
see
theres
no
information
about
the
actual
mechanics
of
voting
she
thought
for
a
minute
she
and
her
husband
were
determined
to
vote
for
barack
obama
and
joe
biden
is
there
a
test
we
can
take
beforehand
she
asked
we
dont
want
to
squander
our
vote
rock
the

updated
my
column
last
saturday
discussed
the
troubles
encountered
by
new
yorkers
who
tried
to
register
to
vote
using
a
form
supplied
by
rock
the

which
was
printed
with
the
address
of
the
state
board
of

in
albany
that
agency
does
not
register

under
the
state
constitution
only
the
county
boards
of

can
register
voters
after
the
column
appeared
heather
smith
the

director
of

the

contacted
me
to
say
that
the
state
address
was
on
a
list
provided
by
the
federal
election
assistance
commission
and
that
her
group
had
twice
received
written
confirmation
from
state
officials
that
they
could
receive
the
applications
in
albany
in
a
mass
email
message
sent
on
friday
afternoon
smith
said
she
was
optimistic
that
everyone
who
filled
out
downloaded
signed
and
mailed
a
form
by
the
oct
10
registration
deadline
will
be
eligible

these
windswept
west
texas
plains
offer
an
improbable
setting
for
one
of
the
college
football
seasons
most
important
games
as
no

texas
tech
hosts
no
1
texas
here
on
saturday
and
while
this
dusty
city
of
217326
braces
for
the
biggest
game
in
university
history
there
is
a
palpable
fear
here
that
mike
leach
the
eccentric
offensive
guru
who
built
tech
into
an
unlikely
national
title
contender
may
not
be
around
much
longer
a
local
radio
station
is
giving
out
keep
mike
leach
at
tech
shirts
this
week
and
many
worry
that
this
cult
hero
of
a
coach
could
bolt
for
clemson
washington
or
one
of
the
many
other
openings
expected
in
the
offseason
one
reason
for
the
concern
is
that
leach
has
just
two
years
remaining
on
his
contract
the
shortest
length
of
any
coach
in
the
big
12
leach
has
gone
7337
in
his
nine
years
here
and
with
an
80
record
this
season
he
has
secured
the
programs
ninth
consecutive
bowl
berth
techs
stadium
is
on
the
verge
of
being
upgraded
for
the
third
time
in
his
tenure
a
testament
to
just
how
popular
he
has
become
coaches
with
that
kind
of
track
record
typically
have
at
least
a
fiveyear
contract
cushion
for
instance
the
contract
for
oklahoma
coach
bob
stoops
expires
in
2013
and
mack
browns
deal
at
texas
ends
in
2016
leachs
expires
in
2010
which
opposing
coaches
can
use
against
him
in
recruiting
i
dont
really
secondguess
it
certainly
not
during
the
season
leach
said
in
a
telephone
interview
this
week
i
just
roll
on
and
see
where
it
takes
you
and
do
the
best
you
can
and
go
from
there
he
is
earning
175
million
this
year
meaning
he
is
not
among
the
five
highestpaid
coaches
in
the
big
12
while
reports
in
the
local
news
media
this
summer
blamed
the
athletic
departments
poor
financial
situation
for
the
lack
of
an
extension
gerald
myers
texas
techs
athletic
director
said
that
was
not
exactly
right
in
a
telephone
interview
this
week
myers
said
he
discussed
a
new
contract
before
this
season
with
leachs
agent
gary
ohagan
of
img
myers
said
he
did
not
talk
to
leach
directly
about
the
contract
but
that
he
could
have
reached
a
new
deal
before
this
season
ohagan
declined
to
comment
we
just
made
a
decision
to
wait
until
the
season
is
over
myers
said
i
knew
we
had
a
chance
to
have
a
really
great
year
and
good
team
knowing
agents
theyre
just
going
to
want
to
redo
everything
again
we
want
mike
to
be
our
coach
and
were
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
make
him
our
coach
for
a
long
time
well
just
take
care
of
that
when
the
seasons
over
asked
if
he
was
disappointed
about
his
contract
situation
leach
said
you
always
hope
for
the
best
you
can
get
but
i
try
to
focus
on
the
task
at
hand
and
just
leave
all
that
stuff
to
the
people
that
help
me
out
that
i
hired
to
do
it
the
situation
has
raised
eyebrows
around
college
football
where
leach
is
respected
for
his
quirky
but
effective
style
his
passbased
system
has
helped
turn
quarterback
graham
harrell
into
a
heisman
trophy
contender
harrell
leads
the
ncaa
football
bowl
subdivision
in
passing
yards
with
3147
the
system
also
helped
michael
crabtree
evolve
into
one
of
the
nations
most
productive
receivers
he
is
tied
for
first
in
the
fbs
with
14
touchdown
catches
by
whipping
the
ball
around
the
field
and
making
defenses
dizzy
with
his
teams
aerial
antics
leach
has
thrived
in
a
place
with
a
small
local
recruiting
base
and
little
history
of
topline
football
success
that
is
why
other
coaches
are
puzzled
that
tech
has
not
bent
over
backward
to
keep
leach
it
does
surprise
me
said
dennis
franchione
the
former
texas
aampampm
coach
if
theyre
smart
theyll
correct
that
as
soon
as
possible
mike
has
done
a
magnificent
job
there
hes
been
to
bowls
every
year
hes
competed
very
well
at
that
level
its
hard
to
win
the
big
12
south
when
you
say
youre
trying
to
win
the
big
12
south
youre
trying
to
compete
for
the
national
championship
thats
what
it
takes
in
that
division
to
do
that
with
a
victory
over
the
topranked
longhorns
on
saturday
leach
would
have
tech
in
position
to
compete
for
a
spot
in
the
bowl
championship
series
title
game
considering
the
advantages
in
financing
recruiting
and
tradition
at
big
12
south
rivals
like
texas
oklahoma
and
texas
aampampm
it
would
be
almost
surreal
if
tech
found
itself
in
position
to
pass
them
and
win
the
division
hes
probably
done
more
with
less
than
anybody
in
that
conference
over
the
past
nine
years
arizona

worked

oklahoma
said
in
a
telephone
interview
i
think
its
a
credit
to
his
system
and
his
way
of
doing
things
hes
very
true
to
that
system
and
to
himself
its
been
very
successful
by
normal
standards
you
would
think
the
guy
can
stay
as
long
as
he
wanted
along
with
leach
being
an
innovator
on
the
field
few
personalities
in
college
football
are
as
engaging
as
he
is
he
is
one
of
the
few
major
college
coaches
in
any
sport
to
have
a
law
degree
and
his
intellectual
fascinations
range
from
south
boston
gangsters
to
pirates
of
players
who
entered
the
tech
football
program
out
of
high
school
or
transferred
between
1998
and
2001
79
percent
graduated
within
six
years

the
highest
percentage
in
the
big
12
according
to
the
latest
ncaa
report
although
leach
has
long
been
viewed
as
a
bit
of
a
maverick
he
is
likely
to
find
his
name
mentioned
at
places
like
tennessee
and
auburn
where
speculation
has
percolated
about
the
future
of
their
coaches
during
seasons
of
struggle
still
myers
said
he
remained
confident
he
would
reach
an
extension
agreement
were
going
to
get
that
done
he
said
absolutely
he
added
there
wasnt
any
question
before
of
whether
we
wanted
mike
to
be
our
coach
that
wasnt
the
issue
at
all
im
not
going
to
get
into
that
now
weve
hashed
all
this
talked
about
it
mike
knows
we
want
him
to
be
our
coach
so
were
going
to
move
on
well
get
it
done
when
the
seasons
over
asked
if
he
saw
himself
finishing
his
career
at
tech
leach
said
i
havent
thought
that
through
exactly
but
im
excited
about
it
now
as
far
as
anything
down
the
road
or
around
the
corner
ill
just
have
to
deal
with
it
then
leachs
impact
on
texas
tech
has
been
discernibly
greater
than
that
of
bob
knight
the
former
indiana
basketball
coach
who
struggled
to
sell
tickets
and
generate
interest
during
a
sevenyear
tenure
on
the
tech
bench
knight
abruptly
retired
last
winter
handing
the
program
to
his
son
pat
during
the
middle
of
the
season
leachs
impact
has
been
so
great
franchione
said
that
the
university
itself
has
grown
in
stature
and
tech
football
has
something
to
do
with
that
growth
that
will
all
be
on
display
when
the
teams
meet
this
weekend
in
a
game
featuring
a
heisman
showdown
between
harrell
and
texas
quarterback
colt
mccoy
whether
the
game
lingers
as
the
high
point
of
leachs
tenure
here
or
is
just
a
milepost
in
a
long
career
is
likely
to
be
determined

mortgage
banker
ben
marsh
has
been
swamped
with
questions
from
clients
worried
about
losing
their
homes
in
this
bad
economy
what
should
i
do
what
should
i
do
each
client
typically
asked
marsh
who
has
offered
up
several
options
including
renting
out
a
room
to
help
cover
the
mortgage
now
im
following
my
own
advice
i
figure
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
better
than
a
pound
of
cure
marsh
is
looking
for
a
roomer
to
rent
a
bedroom
with
plasma
tv
and
stereo
surround

in
his
spacious
threestory

the

a

all
for

tough
and
im
not
closing
the

to
15
loans
a
month
i
used
to
said
the
single
man
in
his
30s
so
i
figured
that
before
things
get
too
bad
id
take
some
steps
to
keep
them
from
getting
bad
as
the
financial
crisis
worsens
marsh
is
like
more
and
more
middleclass
homeowners
around
the
country
who
never
thought
of
taking
in
roomers
but
are
now
quietly
doing
so
hoping
to
use
the
extra
money
to
help
pay
mortgages
or
other
debts
in
this
economy
were
now
in
uncharted
waters
and
ive
never
seen
anything
like
homeowners
taking
in
boarders
except
in
stories
about
the
depression
said
bob
stern
president
of
the
center
of

studies
in
los

which
examines
political
and
economic
issues
in

southland
although
there
are
no
statistics
on
how
many
homeowners
are
renting
out
rooms
for
the
first
time
services
that
place
roomers
say
that
in
recent
months
they
have
received
a
rush
of
calls
from
those
who
had
rarely
used
their
services

middleclass
professionals
living
in
upscale
suburbs
weve
seen
an
upsurge
in
homeowners
renting
out
rooms
in
their
homes
its
a
sign
of
the
times
said
mark
verge
owner
of

which
also
places
roommates
i
was
recently
in
our
valley
office
and
a
62yearold
woman
walked
in
looking
to
share
her
home
with
a
roommate
and
there
was
another
homeowner
who
said
ive
never
done
this
before
but
im
looking
to
rent
out
a
room
in
my
house
to
help
me
with
my
mortgage
verge
said
that
with
residential

foreclosures
still
on
the
rise
in
the
us
more
homeowners
nationwide
are
considering
that
same
choice
in
recent
weeks
room
for

signs
have
been
spotted
on
the

other

have
resorted

marlene
mazzi
of
winnetka
said
the
threat
of
losing
their
twostory
fourbedroom
home
is
what
drove
her
and
husband
carlos
to
list
two
of
the
bedrooms
with
baths
for
750
a
month
each
they
have
rented
one
bedroom
and
continue
looking
for
a
second
roomer
mazzi
48
who
operates
a
home
business
selling
natural
and
organic
products
has
mounting
medical
bills
her
husband
a
home
remodeler
has
been
out
of
work
because
of
the
downturn
in
the
los
angeles
homebuilding
industry
we
need
the
extra
money
to
help
with
our
house
payments
she
said
we
have
our
lifes
savings
invested
in
our
home
and
we
have
to
do
whatever
we
can
to
keep
it
renting
out
part
of
their
home
however
is
not
without
sacrifices
for
mazzi
and
her
family
who
live
under
the
same
roof
including
daughter
stephanie

a
student
at
pierce
college
who
has
her
own
bedroom
and
grown
nephew
paulo
taborga
a
construction
worker
who
sleeps
in
a
converted
family
room
and
also
pays
a
share
of
the
rent
we
are
renting
out
each
bedroom
with
a
bath
and
we
only
have
three
and
a
half
bathrooms
mazzi
said
so
that
means
that
our
family
has
to
share
one
full
bath
renting
out
rooms
is
also
a
humbling
experience
for
many
of
these
homeowners
who
dont
want
relatives
friends
and
neighbors
to
know
they
have
rented
out
rooms
to
strangers
or
that
they
have
financial
problems
many
of
the
homeowners
advertising
for
renters
on
the
internet
confirmed
they
were
taking
that
step
because
of
the
hard
times
but
most
were
reluctant
to
be
identified
in
this
story
it
was
hard
enough
coming
to
grips
with
renting
out
a
room
in
our
home
said
a
northridge
homeowner
who
would
only
identify
himself
as
jeff
i
dont
think
im
ready
to
announce
to
the
world
that
i
need
help
paying
my
mortgage
others
said
they
were
still
dealing
with
the
loss
of
privacy
and
security
involved
in
opening
up
their
home
to
an
outsider
but
ultimately
there
is
one
unifying
overwhelming
incentive
the
hard
times

since

said
having
recently
had
a
friend
stay
with
him
for
a
couple
of
months
had
made
his
decision
easier
im
just
now
for
the
first
time

and
in
many
ways
driven
by
economic
reasons

realizing
that
maybe
renting
a
bedroom
to
someone
else
wouldnt
be
that
bad

said
and
having
another

in

mary
wittenberg
the
president
of
the
new
york
road
runners
club
recalled
friday
that
it
was
not
easy
to
accept
a
title
sponsor
for
the
new
york
city
marathon
in
2003
on
its
own
the
marathons
name
had
become
a
renowned
brand
now
it
was
joining
the
realm
of
stadiums
arenas
and
college
bowl
games
with
corporate
names
but
the
club
needed
the
money
during
a
soft
economy
it
was
a
monumental
shift
that
we
werent
looking
to
make
at
the
time
wittenberg
said
at
tavern
on
the
green
two
days
before
sundays
race
we
were
looking
at
the
time
to
replace
jpmorgan
chase
at
the
very
high
level
of
principal
sponsor
not
to
add
a
title
sponsor
ing
the
dutch
financialservices
giant
agreed
to
spend
an
estimated
2
million
a
year
which
has
probably
increased
since
to
place
its
letters
in
front
of
the
marathons
name
ing
came
to
us
she
said
which
put
us
in
a
good
position
to
say
here
are
the
grounds
well
consider
a
title
sponsor
we
wanted
a
real
partner
and
someone
who
cares
a
lot
about
getting
kids
running
and
about
the
community
the
recent
financial
crisis
weakened
ing
enough
that
the
dutch
government
announced
sunday
that
it
would
provide
134
billion
to
stabilize
ings
operations
if
not
prevent
a
possible
collapse
wittenberg
said
she
was
not
surprised
when
she
heard
of
the
financial
rescue
wed
been
in
close
contact
with
ing
she
said
we
had
a
very
good
sense
throughout
the
crisis
that
ing
was
on
solid
footing
as
we
understood
it
ing
is
quite
significant
in
the
netherlands
so
we
thought
the
bailout
would
likely
be
coming
ing
is
not
cutting
its
commitment
to
the
marathon
which
goes
through
2010
tom
waldron
an
executive
vice
president
for
ing
americas
said
in
an
interview
at
tavern
on
the
green
were
not
letting
up
id
be
wondering
about
people
who
retreat
at
a
time
like
this
at
a
news
conference
a
few
minutes
earlier
he
said
when
ing
is
involved
in
something
were
not
a

here
to
stay
waldrons
vow
to
remain

ings
rights
fee
is
small
compared
with
its
size

will
be
worth
watching
as
the
effects
of
the
global
recession
damage
the
balance
sheets
of
sports
sponsors
who
are
prominent
in
the
financial
and
automotive
sectors
how
many
will
retain
their
commitments
reduce
or
renegotiate
them
or
simply
try
to
get
out
waldron
said
the
new
york
city
marathon
along
with
others
that
it
sponsors
in
the
united
states
and
around
the
world
has
helped
elevate
ings
name
into
something
beyond
initials
that
consumers
dont
recognize
or
confuse
with
img
the
sports
marketer
in
the
united
states
running
was
the
great
sweet
spot
available
to
us
when
we
entered
the
market
in
a
big
way
waldron
said
we
see
it
as
a
real
sweet
spot
for
us
our
studies
show
runners
are
more
likely
to
seek
financial
advisers
ing
like
many
sponsors
cant
specifically
say
that
the
event
they
pour
money
into
generates
new
business
or
in
its
case
new
accounts
or
clients
for
its
banking
and
financial
services
but
waldron
said
ing
measures
consumer
recalls
of
its
name
we
see
an
uptick
in
the
recognition
of
our
name
after
these
races
he
said
in
the
world
of
track
and
field
the
marathon
stands
out
as
an
event
that
unites
professionals
and
amateurs
and
is
untainted
by
drug
scandals
were
an
attractive
global
brand
wittenberg
said
according
to
federal
documents
the
club
took
in
108
million
in
sponsorship
and
television
revenues
in
the
year
ended
march
31
2007
those
were
the
secondlargest
sources
of
revenues
for
the
organization
after
131
million
in
race
entries
the
marathon
diligently
uses
the
ing
name
in
all
public
utterances
press
releases
and
signs
the
staff
knows
ings
money
has
helped
increase
overall
prize
money
and
the
appearance
fees
that
entice
about
40
total
elite
runners
to
new
york
but
the
news
media
isnt
nearly
as
dutiful
about
using
the
ing
name
a
nexis
database
search
showed
that
this
year
and
last
the
print
media
was
10
times
more
likely
to
leave
out
the
ing
name
im
very
good
at
calling
it
the
ing
new
york
city
marathon
and
theyve
paid
for
the
name
said
wittenberg
who
was
wearing
an
ingorange
suit
i
dont
need
to
be
reminded
in
the
upper
echelon
of
the
southeastern
conference
the
difference
in
talent
is
so
slight
that
games
can
be
won
inside
the
players
helmets
as
often
as
inside
the
hash
marks
that
is
the
defining
lesson
that
georgia
coach
mark
richt
says
he
learned
last
season
his
bulldogs
used
a
single
motivational
ploy
to
redefine
their
image
and
transform
their
program
into
a
contender
for
the
national
championship
in
a
search
for
more
emotion
richt
instructed
his
players
before
their
game
last
year
against
florida
in
jacksonville
fla
to
be
sure
to
get
a
penalty
for
excess
celebration
after
their
first
touchdown
they
ended
up
being
called
for
two
after
about
70
players
stormed
the
field
and
danced
in
the
end
zone
georgia
went
on
to
a
4230
victory
suddenly
altering
a
rivalry
in
which
florida
had
won
15
of
the
previous
17
meetings

in
one
of
the
biggest
games
in
the
rivalrys
history
and
richts
ploy
still
dominates
the
conversation
about
the
game
what
the
celebration
did
is
it
brought
a
lot
of
attention
to
our
program
the
georgia
athletic
director
damon
evans
said
it
was
over
all
the
news
and
sports
networks
and
radio
and
things
of
that
nature
it
garnered
a
lot
of
attention
until
the
bulldogs
beat
florida
last
year
they
had
been
perpetually
on
the
cusp
of
the
nations
elite
the
fact
that
they
almost
never
beat
florida
was
one
reason
they
had
not
cracked
through
to
the
rarefied
air
of
college
football
for
two
decades
but
the
intentional
and
indelible
move
by
richt
for
the
florida
game
last
year
changed
the
images
of
richt
and
georgia
as
a
columnist
for
the
atlanta
journalconstitution
mark
bradley
wrote
this
week
richts
maneuver
is
the
single
smartest
thing
he
has
done
as
a
coach
richt
had
lost
five
of
his
first
six
games
against
florida
richt
and
florida
coach
urban
meyer
each
declined
to
discuss
the
celebration
incident
but
richt
did
expound
on
the
lesson
of
last
season
when
georgia
finished
112
and
ranked
no
2
in
his
words
the
2007
bulldogs
reminded
him
that
emotion
creates
energy
richt
is
often
stoic
on
the
sideline
something
he
said
was
a
byproduct
of
his
calling
plays
for
years
and
wanting
to
keep
a
level
head
he
gave
up
those
duties
toward
the
end
of
the
2006
season
and
richt
said
that
since
then
he
had
been
concentrating
more
on
gauging
his
teams
emotion
i
think
ive
learned
that
its
about
5050
he
said
of
the
importance
of
energy
and
scheme
you
better
do
a
good
job
fundamentally
and
schemewise
but
you
need
to
try
and
find
a
way
to
add
energy
richt
acknowledged
that
it
was
a
bit
unlike
his
usual
demeanor
to
be
a
rahrah
coach
he
interrupted
his
briefing
with
the
news
media
tuesday
to
say
bless
you
to
a
reporter
who
had
sneezed
but
his
players
point
to
certain
instances
like
the
occasional
use
of
georgias
black
uniforms
of
little
changes
richt
has
made
to
stir
their
emotions
i
think
its
part
of
mark
growing
as
a
coach
evans
said
of
richts
exploration
of
the
psychological
part
of
the
game
i
think
mark
has
grown
every
single
year
as
a
coach
and
gotten
better
and
better
we
all
learn
new
things
in
a
quiet
moment
sunday
night
meyer
would
not
comment
directly
on
georgias
storming
the
field
last
year
but
he
said
he
had
instructed
his
team
to
keep
quiet
about
the
celebration
because
he
did
not
want
it
to
become
a
focus
of
the
game
i
think
anything
that
gets
in
the
way
of
our
preparation
would
be
a
mistake
meyer
said
we
dont
play
the
game
until
saturday
focus
isnt
an
issue
get
it
out
of
your
mind
lets
not
worry
about
song
and
dancing
lets
worry
about
blocking
and
tackling
the
right
people
as
much
as
the
celebration
helped
spur
georgia
to
victory
last
season
the
real
reason
the
bulldogs
won
is
that
the
gators
could
not
tackle
knowshon
moreno
who
ran
for
188
yards
and
three
touchdowns
on
33
carries
those
yards
helped
more
than
any
celebration
you
could
probably
find
enough
people
to
tell
you
that
the
celebration
did
have
some
big
effect
said
pat
oconnor
a
professor
of
kinesiology
at
georgia
with
a
specialty
in
exercise
and
sports
psychology
but
there
is
no
scientific
evidence
to
show
that
it
helped
theres
too
many
variables
the
end
zone
celebration
may
have
motivated
georgia
but
it
also
infuriated
the
gators
on
saturday
the
bulldogs
may
learn
if
that
ploy
ends
up
backfiring
this
year
or
if
they
have
really
leaped
into
the
national

and
many
of

nearly

most

at

local

said
the

dont
buy
influence
with
los

unified

district
officials
and
see
the

as
support
for

the

and
a
token
of
appreciation
most
construction
bids
with
the
school
district
undertaking
the
largest
school
construction
project
in
the
nation
are
awarded
based
on
lowest
competitive
bids
it
would
be
easy
to
conclude
that
it
helps
garner
favors
but
when
you
look
at
the
mechanics
of
the
bids
there
is
no
discretion

vice

one
of

in

the

is
transparent
fair
and
open
to
the
public
whether
or
not
a
company
financially
contributed
to
a

to
support
any

absolutely
no

mehula
said
between

the

received
264300

the

were

in

canoga

as
well
as
sepulveda

sutter
middle

together
the

are
worth
slightly
more
than
50
million
the

are
the
first
between
sinanian
and
the
lausd
donations
to

q
wont
help
generate
business
between
sinanian
and
the

said
jason
stalboerger
assistant
to
the
companys
president
its
always
a
competitive
bid
theres
no
way
this
directly
helped
he
said
asked
why
the
company
donated
to
the
campaign
stalboerger
said
lausd
board
president
monica
garca
contacted
the
companys
president
i
dont
even
know
what
measure
q
is
to
tell
you
the
truth
stalboerger
said
luis
s
nchez
chief
of
staff
to
garca
confirmed
that
she
had
made
calls
on
behalf
of
the
measure
noting
that
her
efforts
are
normal
she
made
a
lot
of
calls
on
measure
q
he
said
she
spent
a
lot
of
time
fundraising
for
the
measure
though
district
employees
cannot
stump
for
a
ballot
measure
garca
and
her
board
colleagues
are
allowed
to
do
so
according
to
stern
board
member
tamar
galatzan
who
represents
part
of
the
san
fernando
valley
was
not
asked
to
make
calls
on

of

q
said
her
chief
of

tom
waldman
marlene
canter
spoke
about
measure
q
to
a
valley
democratic
club
said
spokesman
mark
taylor
obviously
shes
supportive
on
the
measure
but
she
hasnt
been
making
phone
calls
he
said
on
sept

bernards
brother
inc
based
in
san
fernando
donated
10000
to
the
measure
q
campaign
the
general
contractor
has
one
active
project
with
the
lausd
a
new
middle
school
on
west
46th
street
in
south
los
angeles
at
749
million
to
build
the
53classroom
school
it
was
the
lowest
of
three
bids
for
the
project
the
total
cost
of
the
school
which
should
open
in
two
years
is
approximately
1366million
over
the
span
of
the
lausds
construction
project
bernards

has
been
involved
with
16
projects
according
to
the
districts
strategic

plan
which
total
approximately
895
million
since
we
started
working
with
lausd
20
years
ago
weve
completed
a
little
over
20
schools
said
pellegren
the
general
contracting
company
was
not
solicited
for
donations
pellegren
said
and
the
company
does
not
believe
the
funds
will
earn
any
influence
pellegren
called
the
10000
donation
a
token
of
appreciation
and
notes
that
the
company
has
a
personal
and
professional
commitment
to
public
education
and
the
local
economy
we
believe
in

said
the
owners
of

graduated
from

and
are
valleyborn
and
bred
mehula
said
along
with
a
strict
bidding
process
there
are
oversight
measures
to
ensure
a
fair
process
currently
there
are
more
than
600
contractors
prequalified
to
work
on
lausds
new
school
construction
and
modernization
program
mehula
said
as
an
additional
safeguard
the
office
of
the
inspector
general
and
the
citizens
bond
oversight
committee
routinely
review
the
contracting
procedures
for
compliance
through
audits
and
monthly
reporting
its
correct
that
donations
dont
buy
influence
said
stern
but
donors
are
investing
in
something
that
they
think
theyll
get
a
shot
at
the
question
is
do
they
have
more
contracts
coming
up
with
the
district
these
people
dont
waste
money
stern
said
these
tokens
of
appreciation
are
investments
these
companies
expect
a
shot
at
some
of
that
7
billion
stephon
marbury
sat
docilely
in
jeans
and
a
black
blue
and
white
plaid
shirt
while
all
around
him
marched
the
meticulous
drum
of
preparation
his
teammates
laced
shoes
tugged
jerseys
over
their
chests
and
warmups
over
their
jerseys
marbury
in
his
corner
locker
remained
still
unaffected
and
undaunted
in
another
of
a
seemingly
steady
progression
of
separating
his
knicks
from
the
past
regime
coach
mike
dantoni
listed
marbury
among
his
inactives
before
the
knicks
11687
loss
to
the
philadelphia
76ers
on
friday
night
at
the
wachovia
center
there
were
a
lot
of
things
that
we
need
to
correct
and
get
better
at
dantoni
said
i
thought
we
were
on
our
heels
the
whole
game
and
we
didnt
do
anything
real
aggressive
marbury
is
healthy
void
of
illness
and
injury
he
will
not
however
be
a
part
of
dantonis
rotation
now
and
probably
ever
that
point
was
hammered
in
as
marbury
watched
the
game
from
the
last
seat
on
the
knicks
bench
an
easy
target
to
be
assailed
by
the
taunts
of
fans
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
bench
eddy
curry
sat
next
to
the
assistant
dan
dantoni
curry
also
did
not
play
for
the
second
consecutive
game
although
he
was
in
uniform
marbury
and
curry
were
once
viewed
as
cornerstones
of
the
organization
now
they
bookended
the
teams
bench
it
is
a
place
they
will
probably
find
themselves
for
the
foreseeable
future
until
a
resolution
can
be
found
for
marbury
that
may
come
through
a
buyout
a
release
a
trade
or
an
expiring
contract
that
simply
cannot
expire
soon
enough
mike
dantoni
explained
that
minutes
at
the
guard
spots
were
consumed
by
his
preferred
threesome
of
jamal
crawford
chris
duhon
and
nate
robinson
the
remaining
minutes
would
be
divvied
among
young
players
those
in
the
knicks
future
those
not
named
marbury
a
lighting
rod
of
controversy
in
past
years
its
not
that
hes
done
anything
dantoni
said
before
the
game
adding
that
he
should
have
listed
marbury
as
inactive
against
the
heat
in
the
season
opener
on
wednesday
when
marbury
dressed
but
did
not
play
its
just
the
team
is
going
in
a
different
direction
hes
been
in
the
league
for
a
long
time
im
not
going
to
put
him
out
there
for
four
minutes
friday
was
the
next
step
in
the
evolution
of
marburys
apparent
exile
it
started
subtly
enough
in
july
with
the
signing
of
duhon
then
in
training
camp
dantoni
shuffled
marbury
from
starting
point
guard
to
backup
shooting
guard
anointing
duhon
the
starter
next
came
sporadic
minutes
in
the
preseason
followed
by
wednesdays
48minute
benching
dantoni
insisted
that
the
door
for
marbury
is
ajar
but
it
may
be
closing
shortly
asked
what
would
have
to
happen
for
marbury
to
crack
his
rotation
dantoni
said
injuries
or
somebody
really
just
playing
bad
but
we
picked
the
direction
of
the
club
when
we
signed
duhon
and
with
jamal
and
nate
those
are
the
three
guys
who
are
going
to
get
the
chunk
of
the
minutes
the
bigger
decision
which
was
mine
was
that
he
didnt
have
a
big
role
at
that
point
it
was
now
what
are
we
going
to
do
we
had
to
figure
out
together
it
was
my
decision
on
the
direction
the
team
was
going
to
take
for
the
next
two
or
three
years
that
direction
is
now
all
but
certain
to
exclude
marbury
who
despite
bristling
at
some
questions
continued
to
publicly
put
on
a
good
face
marbury
left
the
bench
to
huddle
in
timeouts
and
slapped
the
hands
of
teammates
who
departed
the
game
he
reiterated
his
statements
that
he
wanted
to
remain
in
new
york
and
help
the
team
win
a
championship
no
matter
how
far
off
that
might
be
im
not
frustrated
at
all
marbury
said
i
have
no
control
over
it
if
it
was
raining
outside
i
cant
get
mad
if
its
raining
ive
got
to
go
get
an
umbrella
and
then
walk
in
the
rain
i
have
no
control
over
the
situation
the
coach
makes
the
decision
on
who
plays
and
whos
not
going
to
play
and
obviously
right
now
he
feels
like
im
not
one
of
the
guys
thats
going
to
be
playing
other
questions
elicited
a
simpler
response
is
it
ok
with
you
coachs
decision
marbury
said
would
you
rather
sit
in
clothes
than
a
jersey
coachs
decision
marbury
said
did
you
want
the
chance
to
talk
to
dantoni
about
the
decision
coachs
decision
marbury
said
for
all
the
predictable
responses
those
questions
returned
when
asked
if
he
wanted
to
play
somewhere
else
marbury
took
a
moment
to
size
up
the
question
then
offered
another
simple
yet
different
answer
next
question
he
said
los

its

cleaved
by
one
of
the
biggest
tornados
on
record
has
defied
the

reversed
the

it
sprouts
with
life
some
signs
are
as
obvious
as
buzzing

by

is
again
lush

lined
with

before

many
stopped
at

to
look
at

the

they
pulled
countless
pieces

pieces
of

that
the

had
thrown
into

about

with

the
rest
has
come
mostly
in
small
increments
sometimes
i
catch
myself
thinking
did
this
really
happen
to
us
thomas
said
but
thoughts
of
the
60
seconds
of
horror
as
the
high
school
principal
dave
meyer
called
it
are
never
far
away
the
school
held
a
tornado
drill
two
weeks
ago
as
iowa
requires
though
it
was
euphemistically
called
a
shelter
drill
some
students
needed
counseling
and
some
were
excused
from
taking
part
parents
said
that
many
children
would
not
sleep
upstairs
in
their
bedrooms
away
from
the
relative
safety
of
the
basement
we
still
have
kids
on
our
football
team
if
theres
bad
weather
especially
wind
it
gets
to
them
thomas
said
they
want
to
be
home
during
the
game
wednesday
dawn
wiegmann
the
wife
of
an
assistant
coach
and
mother
of
a
starting
safety
recalled
the
warm
afternoon
that
the
familys
house
was
destroyed
her
daughter
and
son
coy
were
in
the
basement
with
two
of
coys
teammates
including
hornbuckle
her
husband
jon
was
not
home
as
the
children
screamed
at
her
to
get
downstairs
she
was
frozen
by
the
sight
of
the
approaching
black
twister
only
when
the
80yearold
tree
in
the
yard
was
ripped
from
the
ground
did
she
scurry
to
the
basement
under
the
pool
table
with
the
children
she
remembers
the
noise

it
hurt
she
said

and
how
the
back
half
of
the
house
lifted
and
fell
back
on
its
foundation
three
times
with
a
bang
and
a
shudder
the
wiegmanns
have
lived
divided
since
on
sunday
they
hope
to
move
into
their
rebuilt
home
sleeping
under
the
same
roof
for
the
first
time
since
may
and
on
monday
they
will
be
back
at
ed
thomas
field
where
aplingtonparkersburg
plays
st
edmond
91
from
fort
dodge
there
are
times
during
practice
that
thomas
senses
that
his
players
are
distracted
he
will
stop
and
have
them
look
around
at
the
part
of
town
that
was
wiped
away
and
is
being
rebuilt
that
is
their
motivation
before
the
game
on
wednesday
thomas
paced
inside
the
makeshift
locker
room
the
players
all
74
of
them
in
uniform
were
silent
i
think
youve
understood
since
day
1
that
this
wasnt
some
ordinary
season
thomas
said
he
reminded
the
boys
of
the
first
game
on
the
road
when
the
visiting
bleachers
were
filled
with
aplingtonparkersburg
fans
an
hour
before
kickoff
thats
what
you
guys
have
meant
to
this
community
he
said
weve
been
playing
for
a
lot
of
people
tonight
is
no
different
the
falcons
soon
ran
underneath
the
battered
sign
salvaged
from
the
old
scoreboard
the
people
in
the
bleachers
stood
and
cheered
just
behind
them
in
the
twilight
behind
the
construction
fence
a
school
was
rising
again
los
angeles

call
it
a
crosstown
showdown
but
with
cotton
swabs
instead
of

and

cells
instead
of

bell
students
at
usc
and
ucla
will
compete
next
week
to
see
which
campus
can
register
the
most
people
for
the
national
marrow
donor
program
a
registry
that
connects
patients
with
illnesses
to
those
willing
to
donate
lifesaving
bone
marrow
results
will
be
posted
at
bonemarrowchallengecom
but
organizers
hope
the
rivalry
between
the
two
universities
will
prove
to
be
more
than
just
a
numbers
game
the
real
goal
is
to
find
a
match
for
robert
corrales
a
santa
clarita
sheriffs
deputy
who
was
diagnosed
with
acute
myeloid
leukemia
in
april
the
only
cure
is
a
bone
marrow
transplant
but
a
match
with
his
ethnic
background
has
proved
elusive
among
the
11million
people
in
the
registry
even
his
brothers
and
sisters
didnt
match
hes
unique
because
of
his
mixed
ethnicity
said
dr
ronald
paquette
corrales
physician
and
a
researcher
at
uclas
jonsson
comprehensive
cancer
center
corrales
is
mexican
but
his
grandfather
on
his
fathers
side
was
chinese
as
it
turns
out
corrales
skin
tissue
needs
to
match
his
chinese
ancestry
those
from
multiracial
backgrounds
present
unique
challenges
for
finding
an
appropriate
tissue
type
paquette
said
the
us
census
has
found
that
up
to
11
percent
of
the
population
in
several
western
states
checks
more
than
one
race
on
forms
in
hawaii
the
most
common
combination
is
asian
and
hawaiian
or
other
pacific
islander
in
california
it
is
white
and
other
race
and
in
alaska
and
oklahoma
it
is
white
and
american
indian
this
just
goes
to
show
that
multiracial
america
is
not
a
simple
product
of
urban
melting
pots
but
a
wideranging
and
far
from
uniform
phenomenon
a
statement
on
the
census
web
site
reads
but
that
trend
doesnt
trickle
down
to
the
donor
marrow
registry
the
challenge
for
finding
a
match
is
probably
greatest
in
this
growing
community
of
racially
and
ethnically
diverse
people
said
dennis
confer
chief
medical
officer
for
the
national
marrow
donor
program
the
tissue
type
is
very
complex
the
chance
that
two
people
from
two
different
groups
will
create
a
new
tissue
type
in
children
is
very
high
thats
why
there
is
a
great
need
for
donors
from
all
backgrounds
even
among
whites
because
of
the
many
different
skin
types
corrales
and
his
wife
olga
were
on
a
cruise
in
mexico
when
he
started
feeling
ill
the
ships
doctor
deemed
him
too
sick
to
continue
traveling
since
then
corrales
56
the
father
of
four
sons
undergoes
chemotherapy
treatments
twice
a
day
and
is
hospitalized
at
ucla
medical
centersanta
monica
for
weeks
because
he
has
no
immune
system
we
have
to
stay
positive
olga
corrales
said
we
have
our
faith
that
helps
us
through
everything
and
i
have
to
be
the
advocate
to
try
to
save
him
but
the
desperate
need
for
a
bone
marrow
match
touched
family
friend
nancy
ullman
a
usc
alum
who
helped
set
up
the
crosstown
rivalry
to
register
bone
marrow
for
the
most
part
we
knew
both
campuses
had
culturally
diverse
students
she
said
im
a
graduate
of
usc
and
the
rivalry
is
embedded
in
students
we
thought
we
could
generate
a
little
bit
of
buzz
get
a
lot
of
kids
to
register
and
help
them
understand
that
marrow
has
everything
to
do
with
race
and
nothing
to
do
with
blood
type
what
deters
many
from
registering
their
donor
type
are
misconceptions
ullman
and
others
say
to
register
all
that
is
needed
is
a
swab
of
the
inside
of
the
cheek
to
gather
cells
during
the
marrow
donation
doctors
make
several
small
incisions
through
the
skin
over
the
back
of
the
pelvic
bones
according
to
the
national
donor
program
registry
they
then
insert
a
special
hollow
needle
through
these
incisions
and
a
syringe
is
attached
to
the
needle
to
draw
out
the
marrow
corrales
is
worth
all
that
ullman
said
bob
is
easygoing
spontaneous
witty
and
a
great
storyteller
she
said
he
has
a
way
of
making
everyone
around
him
feel
important
thats
probably
why
he
is
fought
over
by
the
ucla
medical
center
nurses
his
coworkers
love
him
because
he
brings
them
burritos
in
the
morning
stuffed
with
bacon
eggs
and
homemade
skillet
potatoes
corrales
who
grew
up
in
the
city
of
san
fernando
and
in
pacoima
attended
college
of
the
canyons
in
valencia
where
he
played
baseball
he
was
recruited
to
play
at
pepperdine
university
but
drove
a
hard
bargain
and
refused
to
go
unless
his
buddy
steve
smith
went
with
him
the
school
eventually
accepted
smith
who
went
on
to
become
the
thirdbase
coach
for
the
2008
world
series
champion
philadelphia
phillies
as
for
the
crosstown
showdown
corrales
said
he
is
focusing
on
the
big
picture
and
not
on
finding
a
match
for
himself
the
chances
of
a
donor
coming
out
of
this
bone
marrow
drive
are
not
very
good
he
said
from
his
hospital
bed
but
just
to
get
the
people
out
there
to
sign
up
then
hopefully
someone
can
be
a
match
to
save
another
life

around
him
and
their
antics
his
leg
throbbed
as
he
wandered
the
campus
trying
to
remember
where
to
go
his
concentration
whipsawed
and
the
words
he
read
in
textbooks
slipped
easily
from
his
memory
the
result
of
a
mild
traumatic
brain
injury
a
charismatic
marine
corps
veteran
blanchard
25
could
trace
his
difficulties
to
iraq
and
the
summer
of
2005
when
a
humvee
he
was
riding
in
detonated
a
bomb
buried
under
the
sand
the
blast
claimed
half
his
left
leg
and
mangled
his
right
leg
in
short
order
he
endured
numerous
surgeries
months
in
a
wheelchair
a
titanium
prosthesis
and
intermittent
swirls
of
depression
and
pessimism
until
as
he
tells
it
he
woke
up
one
morning
and
decided
to
count
his
blessings
college
was
the
first
step
in
his
plan
to
reshape
his
life
after
four
years
in
the
marines
one
combat
tour
in
iraq
and
a
lifechanging
injury
how
tough
could
it
be
i
thought
im
so
motivated
so
intelligent

i
am
taking
on
the
school
says
blanchard
who
now
leads
efforts
at
george
washington
and
nationally
to
bridge
the
gulf
between
combat
and
campus
it
didnt
happen
that
way
at
all
i
was
so
lost
few
students
make
their
way
to
campus
directly
from
an
outpatient
bed
at
walter
reed
army
medical
center
as
blanchard
did
but
with
the
passage
this
summer
of
a
new
gi
bill
that
offers
a
greatly
improved
package
of
education
benefits
there
will
be
more
when
the
bill
goes
into
effect
in
august
2009
a
boom
in
post911
veterans
is
expected
at
colleges
and
universities
across
the
nation
and
unlike
the
aftermath
of
the
vietnam
war
when
few
colleges
and
universities
welcomed
military
veterans
a
growing
number
are
taking
steps
to
ease
the
difficult
transition
still
in
its
early
stages
at
many
institutions
the
effort
is
led
in
large
part
by
a
generation
of
student
veterans
who
came
to
view
their
own
struggles
to
adapt
to
academic
life
as
dispiriting
and
unnecessary
some
people
are
talking
about
it
like
its
a
movement
says
derek
blumke
a
university
of
michigan
senior
and
cofounder
and
president
of
student
veterans
of
america
an
advocacy
group
formed
earlier
this
year
a
lot
of
people
are
returning
now
and
realizing
they
want
to
go
to
college
they
are
coming
back
getting
together
and
wanting
to
make
this
happen
people
are
mobilizing
the
legislation
fueling
the
movement
pays
homage
to
the
original
gi
bill
of
rights
which
is
considered
one
of
the
most
successful
and
transformative
government
programs
in
history
it
ultimately
sent
22
million
veterans
to
college
after
world
war
ii
and
helped
five
million
others
acquire
trade
skills
rather
than
come
home
to
sell
apples
as
many
neglected
veterans
did
after
world
war
i
these
veterans
helped
broaden
the
middle
class
and
democratize
universities
which
were
primarily
bastions
of
the
wealthy
and
well
connected
few
would
argue
that
the
impact
of
the
new
gi
bill
formally
the
post911
veterans
educational
assistance
act
will
rival
that
of
its
prototype
mostly
because
there
are
far
fewer
eligible
veterans
and
the
new
law
is
less
generous
the
original
bill
paid
for
public
private
and
vocational
education
this
one
covers
public
education
for
most
veterans
who
served
after
911
and
eases
the
burden
of
private
tuition
the
law
also
extends
many
benefits
to
members
of
the
national
guard
and
the
reserve
and
offers
stipends
for
housing
and
textbooks
but
it
does
not
pay
for
nondegree
vocational
training
still
the
law
is
viewed
both
by
veterans
and
colleges
as
an
opportunity
to
do
right
by
todays
combattested
troops
and
mend
a
relationship
that
has
badly
frayed
since
the
antiwar
movement
of
the
1960s
the
hope
is
that
new
veterans
buffeted
by
war
and
a
troubled
economy
can
seize
on
college
as
a
roadmap
to
a
productive
life
beyond
the
military
this
is
the
biggest
step
toward
turning
the
page
on
what
we
did
after
vietnam
says
paul
rieckhoff
executive
director
of
the
advocacy
group
iraq
and
afghanistan
veterans
of
america
we
saw
the
gi
bill
as
a
way
of
attempting
to
deal
with
veterans
reacclimation
issues
in
a
more
comprehensive
way
they
are
in
a
safe
place
there
in
school
moving
forward
with
their
life
rieckhoffs
group
spearheaded
efforts
to
pass
the
bill
written
by
sen
jim
webb
a
virginia
democrat
and
marine
corps
veteran
the
bill
met
strong
resistance
from
john
mccain
the
senator
from
arizona
who
is
now
the
republican
candidate
for
president
and
from
president
bush
who
argued
that
it
would
prompt
service
members
to
choose
college
over
reenlistment
after
just
three
years
but
ultimately
it
passed
handily
and
was
signed
into
law
on
june
30
of
course
veterans
have
never
stopped
going
to
college
with
government
help
even
as
the
country
moved
to
a
volunteer
military
the
existing
law
the
montgomery
gi
bill
was
passed
in
1984
and
was
named
after
the
mississippi
congressman
who
worked
to
update
the
benefits
but
over
time
inflation
outpaced
the
payments
veterans
who
often
enlist
on
the
promise
of
a
college
education
found
that
the
program
in
essence
paid
for
community
college
many
have
been
forced
to
find
fulltime
jobs
to
pay
their
bills
in
august
the
benefit
was
increased
by
221
to
1321
a
month
about
40
percent
of
the
450000
veterans
in
the
current
program
attend
community
colleges
about
the
same
percentage
that
attend
fouryear
institutions
according
to
the
department
of
veterans
affairs
many
do
so
by
choice
twoyear
colleges
offer
flexible
class
schedules
enroll
older
students
and
can
feel
less
intimidating

all
important
issues
to
veterans
who
are
usually
older
and
often
married
with
families
online
programs
are
popular
for
the
same
reasons
some
veterans
though
say
they
wind
up
in
community
colleges
or
fail
to
transfer
to
a
fouryear
institution
by
necessity
the
cost
is
simply
prohibitive
the
new
gi
bill
will
change
that
but
money
isnt
the
only
hurdle
veterans
for
the
most
part
do
not
have
an
easy
time
getting
into
fouryear
colleges
and
universities
particularly
selective
private
ones
boredom
or
frustration
with
high
school

often
accompanied
by
mediocre
transcripts
and
sat
scores

led
many
into
the
military
in
the
first
place
but
many
institutions
have
failed
to
make
allowances
for
the
soldiers
special
circumstances
or
to
promote
themselves
as
veteranfriendly
for
veterans
adapting
to
civilian
life
let
alone
student
life
is
difficult
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
new
veteran
particularly
one
with
mental
or
physical
injuries
to
feel
overwhelmed
by
the
choices
and
rhythms
of
college
ismael
valenzuela
33
hopes
one
day
to
study
at
columbia
university
reared
in
el
paso
texas
he
did
a
lackluster
stint
at
a
community
college
then
in
1997
moved
to
new
york
to
study
classical
guitar
at
the
new
school
despite
his
passion
he
didnt
feel
ready
to
get
serious
a
big
piece
of
the
puzzle
was
still
missing
he
says
a
patriot
he
had
long
imagined
himself
in
the
military
so
in
2000
valenzuela
enlisted
in
the
marine
corps
twice
he
was
deployed
to
iraq
the
first
time
at
the
start
of
the
war
the
second
tour
with
the
country
in
the
throes
of
an
insurgency
was
much
rougher
days
were
filled
with
seekanddestroy
missions
and
searching
houses
for
weapons
caches
a
buddy
died
in
combat
explosions
and
small
arms
fire
were
a
constant
hazard
last
year
he
decided
to
leave
the
corps
a
tough
decision
he
traveled
through
europe
for
a
while
and
came
home
ready
for
college
but
he
had
missed
the
application
deadline
for
borough
of
manhattan
community
college
he
was
told
to
reapply
later
in
the
year
fearing
that
if
he
did
not
begin
school
right
away
he
would
start
a
downward
drift
valenzuela
asked
to
speak
to
the
director
of
admissions
at
first
the
director
eugenio
barrios
saw
in
him
just
another
case
of
procrastination
and
immaturity
but
valenzuela
brought
up
his
sevenyear
career
in
the
corps
and
showed
pictures
of
a
bangedup
humvee
in
iraq
the
vehicle
had
flipped
in
an
accident
a
common
danger
and
valenzuela
had
been
knocked
unconscious
for
10
minutes
he
had
shaken
off
the
daze
and
gone
right
back
to
work
the
two
men
shared
a
rapport
and
barrios
agreed
to
become
the
veterans
mentor
valenzuela
did
not
do
so
well
on
the
placement
exam
in
reading
writing
and
math
required
by
the
city
university
of
new
york
that
did
not
surprise
him
because
the
day
of
the
test
he
had
trouble
focusing
and
remembering
facts
perhaps
a
product
of
both
posttraumatic
stress
disorder
and
a
mild
traumatic
brain
injury
barrios
was
quick
to
tell
him
that
to
succeed
he
would
need
to
apply
everything
he
learned
in
the
corps
to
his
schoolwork
some
need
more
help
than
others
because
their
academic
beginnings
were
not
as
strong
barrios
says
of
veterans
they
bring
a
certain
level
of
maturity
and
a
certain
appreciation
of
our
system
their
desire
is
there
there
is
a
word
in
spanish
for
that
las
ganas
they
have
that
very
strong
will
to
want
to
succeed
valenzuelas
return
from
war
has
not
been
entirely
smooth
or
entirely
unusual
in
the
months
after
he
left
the
corps
he
became
easily
enraged
got
into
fights
and
drank
two
12packs
of
heineken
a
night
he
says
he
felt
adrift
and
apathetic
that
slowly
began
to
change
after
he
started
college
in
january
with
the
help
of
his
psychiatrist
at
the
department
of
veterans
affairs
his
new
girlfriend
and
barrios
he
has
wrestled
down
some
of
his
mental
health
problems
talking
about
the
war
was
the
first
step
in
a
long
process
i
have
gotten
a
lot
better
he
says
i
have
been
pampered
right
now
by
the
va
and
the
school
they
have
been
perfect
more
than
perfect
academically
he
has
struggled
he
studies
three
times
as
hard
as
many
other
students
he
says
but
makes
progress
every
day
he
is
passing
all
his
classes
this
term
though
he
failed
math
over
the
summer
his
goal
is
to
study
astronomy
and
engineering
then
return
to
the
marine
corps
as
a
pilot
i
can
see
why
it
would
be
hard
to
follow
through
says
valenzuela
an
unyielding
optimist
now
i
dont
know
how
many
times
i
just
want
to
throw
the
books
but
i
am
supermotivated
that
is
one
of
the
things
keeping
me
sane
still
old
habits
die
hard
even
in
the
classroom
i
always
know
where
the
exit
is
how
many
windows
there
are
and
he
says
with
a
smile
whats
the
weapon
of
choice
shortly
after
valenzuela
first
showed
up
for
class
at
the
community
colleges
lower
manhattan
complex
aubrey
arcangel
sought
him
out
arcangel
is
president
of
the
student
veterans
club
and
he
wanted
to
make
sure
valenzuela
was
doing
all
right
it
was
a
protective
gesture
not
so
very
different
from
the
code
the
military
lives
by
new
veterans
step
into
college
life
from
a
highly
structured
system
and
are
bedeviled
by
the
looseness
they
find
how
to
start
a
day
without
a
schedule
one
that
usually
begins
with
physical
training
arcangel
26
who
left
the
army
after
four
years
and
one
tour
in
iraq
explains
you
have
pt
formation
then
you
have
pt
then
you
have
another
formation
and
blah
blah
blah
there
is
a
procedure
for
everything
a
field
manual
a
technical
manual
for
everything
then
there
are
the
other
students
many
of
whom
arrive
right
from
high
school
by
and
large
fellow
students
have
welcomed
veterans
although
they
do
sometimes
display
a
morbid

some
former
marines
say
inappropriate

curiosity
about
life
on
the
ground
in
iraq
the
discomfort
many
veterans
mention
has
less
to
do
with
any
antiwar
attitudes
than
with
the
students
maturity
level
and
remove
from
the
war
with
fewer
than
27
million
in
the
armed
forces

roughly
2
percent
of
americans
18
to
49

young
people
know
little
about
the
military
how
it
works
and
what
it
is
like
to
fight
in
a
war
for
arcangel
iraq
where
he
provided
security
for
a
lieutenant
colonel
has
been
difficult
to
shake
off
if
i
were
back
there
i
think
i
would
go
insane
he
says
it
seemed
almost
surreal
that
is
one
reason
he
became
a
student
leader
working
to
hook
veterans
up
with
one
another
in
a
social
network
there
are
some
veterans
that
are
socially
awkward
and
this
helps
he
says
at
borough
of
manhattan
community
college
fewer
than
1
percent
of
enrolled
students
are
veterans

160
of
more
than
19000
students
channeling
the
warrior
mentality
into
textbooks
and
tests
can
be
especially
trying
for

one

i
had
to
recruit

from

to
get
enough
in
the

he
says
they
didnt
just
show
up
on

i
reached
out

i
met
with

on

schupp
sees
camaraderie
in

as
crucial
to
getting

to
show
up
to
stay

to
thrive
they
tell
me
over
and
over
they
wouldnt
have
come
to

otherwise
he
says
in

its
the
team
the
squadron
must
survive
when
you
come
to
school
its
all
personal

my

the

he

his

for

says
blumke
a

in

force
the
michigans
uclas
and

there
is
a
social
stigma
attached
to
those
schools
when
i
told
my
friends
i
was
going
to
u
of
m
they
couldnt
believe
it
because
of
the
liberal
ideas
that
they
dont
like
the
military
there
they
were
stuck
in
the
60s
and
70s
until
recently
universities
made
little
effort
to
recruit
veterans
or
to
alter
the
misgivings
that
blumke
expressed
jim
selbe
the
assistant
vice
president
for
lifelong
learning
for
the
american
council
on
education
which
represents
1600
colleges
and
universities
says
that
just
two
years
ago
a
significant
gap
existed
between
rhetoric
and
practice
the
gap
is
beginning
to
steadily
diminish
he
says
there
is
a
deep
sense
of
obligation
to
do
whats
necessary
to
provide
an
opportunity
for
returning
veterans
last
year
the
council
started
a
program
to
provide
individualized
college
counseling
to
seriously
injured
veterans
at
military
hospitals
the
program
was
the
brainchild
of
james
wright
the
president
of
dartmouth
who
has
led
efforts
to
bring
more
veterans
to
college
the
allvolunteer
military
draws
in
a
segment
of
the
population
that
has
not
customarily
gone
to
college
in
the
same
proportion
as
other
parts
of
our
society
says
wright
a
former
marine
he
hopes
the
new
gi
bill
will
cause
them
to
raise
their
aspirations
dartmouths
admissions
office
takes
military
experience
into
account
wright
says
he
advises
veterans
to
bring
their
service
record
to
the
institutions
attention
perhaps
through
the
essay
requirement
discipline
as
well
as
job
and
leadership
qualities
brings
something
to
the
table
that
cannot
be
matched
by
young
students
yet
there
has
to
be
a
sense
that
the
veteran
can
cope
with
the
demands
of
the
courses
we
dont
look
for
the
same
thing
in
terms
of
test
scores
but
we
are
not
doing
them
any
favors
wright
emphasizes
we
want
to
make
sure
they
are
prepared
and
would
succeed
the
number
of
recent
veterans
attending
dartmouth
is
tiny
all
matriculating
in
the
last
two
years
last
year
two
became
freshmen
this
fall
there
are
six
in
a
firstyear
class
of
1077
blumke
recognizes
the
uphill
struggle
and
has
refined
his
organizations
pitch
which
he
delivers
repeatedly
to
colleges
and
universities
war
is
not
glamorous
but
it
is
reality
we
bring
that
experience
to
people
who
dont
know
about
it
that
experience
ultimately
got
james
mcmahon
who
served
four
years
in
the
marines
into
the
college
of
his
choice
mcmahon
23
had
nearly
given
up
on
attending
the
university
of
rhode
island
his
home
state
school
the
admissions
office
looked
at
fiveyearold
sat
scores
and
poor
high
school
grades
i
didnt
have
a
vested
interest
in
college
and
was
unimpressed
he
was
rejected
mcmahon
was
in
california
training
other
marines
for
deployment
to
iraq
so
his
father
and
girlfriend
took
up
the
battle
calling
the
admissions
office
and
sending
letters
that
underscored
his
successes
my
father
finally
got
in
touch
with
the
president
of
the
university
and
with
his
typical
irish
charm
said
something
might
be
wrong
with
the
computer
system
im
sure
its
nobodys
fault
but
did
you
just
deny
a
combat
veteran
with
all
this
experience
and
a
guaranteed
40000
if
he
comes
to
your
school

two
weeks
later
an
acceptance
letter
arrived
admissions
offices
mcmahon
says
are
just
not
wired
to
think
about
it
in
those
terms
i
didnt
take
it
as
a
personal
insult
i
was
more
laughing
at
the
university
my
friends
from
high
school
they
have
bachelor
degrees
from
there
and
these
are
the
same
kids
i
was
getting
into
trouble
with
four
or
five
years
ago
an
artilleryman
mcmahon
is
being
tested
for
a
mild
traumatic
brain
injury
he
recently
cut
back
on
his
classes
saying
that
the
injury
was
making
it
hard
to
keep
up
but
he
is
majoring
in
sociology
with
a
focus
on
criminal
justice
and
has
a
324
average
like
his
fellow
veterans
blanchard
is
determined
not
to
let
his
injuries
dictate
his
future
following
in
his
fathers
footsteps
he
joined
the
marine
corps
right
out
of
high
school
in
2001
his
specialty
was
combat
engineering
because
i
wanted
to
blow
stuff
up
he
says
in
2005
he
was
deployed
to
iraq
near
the
syrian
border
where
he
went
on
patrols
and
blew
up
gates
and
doors
so
buildings
could
be
searched
six
months
later
his
humvee
hit
the
roadside
bomb
that
took
half
his
leg
after
his
roommate
at
walter
reed
was
accepted
by
georgetown
university
blanchard
decided
to
aim
high
himself
and
apply
to
george
washington
university
which
has
about
300
veterans
who
receive
benefits
and
200
who
do
not
a
university
spokeswoman
says
the
two
veterans
moved
into
an
apartment
in
virginia
together
and
blanchard
started
his
first
year
but
he
didnt
count
on
his
brain
playing
tricks
on
him
although
doctors
had
diagnosed
mild
traumatic
brain
injury
he
shrugged
it
off
compared
with
losing
half
a
leg
and
nearly
losing
his
other
leg
a
slightly
shakenup
brain
did
not
register
as
a
concern
whatever
blanchard
thought
to
himself
two
days
into
classes
though
he
noticed
that
he
was
retaining
little
of
what
he
read
or
heard
in
the
classroom
my
mind
was
blurred
cloudy
all
the
time
and
i
was
walking
around
in
a
daze
says
blanchard
who
does
not
advertise
his
injuries
because
he
wants
no
special
treatment
i
had
a
full
load
and
i
dropped
all
my
classes
except
two
and
yet
im
studying
all
the
time
it
was
so
frustrating
over
time
his
brain
learned
to
compensate
i
just
started
to
remember
better
adjusting
how
i
think
says
blanchard
now
a
junior
studying
international
business
its
still
very
hard
with
classes
like
regression
analysis
ill
never
be
the
same
again
he
says
jokingly
although
his
good
leg
hurts
all
the
time
he
refrains
from
taking
pain
medication
whenever
he
can
instead
he
works
out
at
the
gym
and
allows
his
endorphins
to
lessen
his
discomfort
reduce
his
anxiety
and
help
him
concentrate
he
also
started
a
student
veterans
group
which
has
put
him
in
touch
with
about
20
other
veterans
and
has
greatly
diminished
his
sense
of
isolation
this
semester
his
grades
are
average
and
he
is
taking
a
full
load
of
courses
along
with
added
responsibilities
as
vice
president
of
student
veterans
of
america
he
ran
on
a
whim
in
the
spring
and
was
voted
in
he
is
setting
up
a
database
of
services
for
veterans
and
working
on
plans
to
take
his
fellow
veterans
to
walter
reed
to
help

and
urge

wounded
service
members
to
go
to
college
he
hopes
to
collaborate
with
the
universitys
hospital
on
treating
student
veterans
for
combatrelated
problems
looking
back
he
says
it
was
his
injury
and
the
discipline
he
learned
as
a
marine
that
pushed
him
toward
college
a
first
for
his
family
now
that
he
is
here
courtesy
of
the
government
he
is
not
about
to
squander
the
opportunity
i
went
through
hell
and
my
body
shows
it
blanchard
says
but
i
said
this
is
going
to
be
a
blessing
i
didnt
know
how
i
just
knew
it
would

mortgage
banker
ben
marsh
has
been
swamped
with
questions
from
clients
worried
about
losing
their
homes
in
this
bad
economy
what
should
i
do
what
should
i
do
they
have
asked
marsh
who
has
offered
up
several
options
including
renting
out
a
room
to
help
cover
the
mortgage
now
im
following
my
own
advice
i
figure
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
better
than
a
pound
of
cure
marsh
is
looking
for
a
boarder
to
rent
a
bedroom
that
has
a
plasma
tv
and
stereo
surround
sound
in
his
spacious
threestory

in
the

the

includes
a
baby
grand
piano
and
other
musical
instruments
a

and
a

all
for
1000
a

times
are
tough
and
im
not
closing
the
12
to
15
loans
a

i
used
to
said
the
single
man
in
his
30s
so
i
figured
that
before
things
get
too
bad
id
take
some
steps
to
keep
them
from
getting
bad
as
the
financial
crisis
worsens
marsh
is
like
more
and
more
middleclass
homeowners
around
the
country
who
never
thought
of
taking
in
boarders
but
are
now
quietly
doing
so
hoping
to
use
the
extra
money
to
help
pay
mortgages
or
other
debts
in
this
economy
were
now
in
uncharted
waters
and
ive
never
seen
anything
like
homeowners
taking
in
boarders
except
in
stories
about
the
depression
said
bob
stern
president
of
the
center
of
governmental
studies
in
los
angeles
which
examines
political
and
economic
issues
in
the
southland
although
there
are
no
statistics
on
how
many
homeowners
are
renting
out
rooms
for
the
first
time
services
that
place
boarders
say
that
in
recent
months
they
have
received
a
rush
of
calls
from
those
who
had
rarely
used
their
services

middleclass
professionals
living
in
upscale
suburbs
weve
seen
an
upsurge
in
homeowners
renting
out
rooms
in
their
homes
its
a
sign
of
the
times
said
mark
verge
owner
of
westside
rentals
which
also
places
roommates
i
was
recently
in
our
valley
office
and
a
62yearold
woman
walked
in
looking
to
share
her
home
with
a
roommate
and
there
was
another
homeowner
who
said
ive
never
done
this
before
but
im
looking
to
rent
out
a
room
in
my
house
to
help
me
with
my
mortgage
verge
said
that
with
residential
mortgage
foreclosures
still
on
the
rise
in
the
us
more
homeowners
nationwide
are
considering
that
same
choice
in
recent
weeks
room
for

signs
have
been
spotted
on
the
lawns
of
some
homes
in

other
homeowners
have
resorted
to
the

to
list
rooms
in
their
houses
marlene
mazzi
of
winnetka
said
the
threat
of
losing
their
twostory
fourbedroom
home
is
what
drove
her
and
husband
carlos
to
list
two
of
the
bedrooms
with
baths
for
750
a
month
each
they
have
rented
one
bedroom
and
continue
looking
for
a
second
boarder
mazzi
48
who
operates
a
home
business
selling
natural
and
organic
products
has
mounting
medical
bills
her
husband
a
home
remodeler
has
been
out
of
work
because
of
the
downturn
in
the
los
angeles
homebuilding
industry
we
need
the
extra
money
to
help
with
our
house
payments
she
said
we
have
our
lifes
savings
invested
in
our
home
and
we
have
to
do
whatever
we
can
to
keep
it
renting
out
part
of
their
home
however
is
not
without
sacrifices
for
mazzi
and
her
family
who
live
under
the
same
roof
including
daughter
stephanie
20
a
student
at
pierce
college
who
has
her
own
bedroom
and
grown
nephew
paulo
taborga
a
construction
worker
who
sleeps
in
a
converted
family
room
and
also
pays
a
share
of
the
rent
we
are
renting
out
each
bedroom
with
a
bath
and
we
only
have
three
and
a
half
bathrooms
mazzi
said
so
that
means
that
our
family
has
to
share
one
full
bath
renting
out
rooms
is
also
a
humbling
experience
for
many
of
these
homeowners
who
dont
want
relatives
friends
and
neighbors
to
know
they
have
rented
out
rooms
to
strangers
or
that
they
have
financial
problems
many
of
the
homeowners
advertising
for
boarders
on
the
internet
confirmed
they
were
taking
that
step
because
of
the
hard
times
today
but
most
were
reluctant
to
be
identified
in
this
story
it
was
hard
enough
coming
to
grips
with
renting
out
a
room
in
our
home
said
a
northridge
homeowner
who
would
only
identify
himself
as
jeff
i
dont
think
im
ready
to
announce
to
the
world
that
i
need
help
paying
my
mortgage
others
said
they
were
still
dealing
with
the
loss
of
privacy
and
security
involved
in
opening
up
their
home
to
an
outsider
but
ultimately
there
is
one
unifying
overwhelming
incentive

hard
times

concerning

and
borrowed
a
simple
message
from
the

help
mayor
douglas
palmer
pleaded
like
mayors
and
governors
across
the
country
palmer
asked
congress
to
funnel
money
to
city
and
state
governments
where
tax
revenues
are
plummeting
and
requests
for
aid
are
soaring
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
has
begun
appealing
for
congressional
help
with
the
precarious
financial
status
of
many
states
unlike
the
federal
government
most
states
and
cities
require
balanced
budgets
and
the
conference
has
estimated
a
26
billion
shortfall
for
27
states
so
far
this
year
if
the
economy
continues
its
slide
that
figure
is
surely
to
grow
with
some
estimates
rising
to
100
billion
by

david

of

whose

street
tax

has
estimated

deficit
over

and
new

citys
mayor
michael
bloomberg
who
also
sees
his

shrinking
precipitously
has
called
on
washington
for
a
new
new
deal
if
congress
and
the
white
house
can
bail
out
bankers
and
insurance
companies
and
possibly
the
auto
industry
they
should
be
able
to
help
state
and
local
governments
too
the
aid
could
be
temporary
the
way
it
has
been
during
past
recessions
and
it
should
come
after
cities
and
states
have
downsized
to
the
essentials
in
addition
to
extending
unemployment
benefits
and
food
stamp
programs
which
provide
the
biggest
immediate
boosts
to
states
economies
one
promising
idea
being
pushed
by
governors
is
to
put
more
federal
money
into
projects
like
roads
subways
bridges
tunnels
schools
and
sewage
plants
this
help
should
go
where
work
already
has
started

can

experts
told

recently
that
they
have
at

26

90
days
all
they
need
is
the
money
gov
jon
corzine
of
new
jersey
reminded
the
house
committee
on
transportation
and
infrastructure
this
week
that
federal
support
of
this
kind
would
put
people
to
work
he
estimated
that
each
1
billion
for
public
works
would
create
35000
jobs
at
the
same
time
congress
and
the
white
house
would
be
helping
to
stem
the
rapid
deterioration
of
the
nations
infrastructure
many
states
also
need
added
support
for
medicaid
during
the
last
recession
in
2001
congress
provided
states
an
extra
10
billion
in
block
grants
and
another
10
billion
to
help
temporarily
with
medicaid
the
program
could
use
longerrange
fixes
of
course
but
emergency
funding
for
at
least
two
years
would
certainly
help
protect
the
nations
most
vulnerable
investing
in
highways
and
health
care
is
a
far
more
effective
way
of
stimulating
the
economy
than
repeating
the
mistake
of
sending
rebate
checks
to
a
broad
array
of
individual
taxpayers
most
americans
used
those
federal
bonuses
to
fill
the
gas
tank
a
fleeting
assist
to
family
budgets
but
a
big
boon
for
the
oil
companies
with
their
record
profits
the
oil
companies
are
the
last
ones
the
government
should
be
helping
at
this
point
and
states
wont
use
federal
funds
for
executive
bonuses
or
corporate
junkets
the
way
some
financial
firms
have
giving
money
to
state
and
local
governments
has
its
hazards
of
course
congress
must
resist
making
this
next
stimulus
into
an
ugly
porkfest
with
money
for
everybodys
favorite
waterworks
and
it
cannot
become
an
excuse
for
governors
and
mayors
to
avoid
making
hard
decisions
about
how
to
cut
their
own
budgets
but
it
is
time
for
congress
and
the
white
house
to
recognize
how
crucial
it
is
to
help
local
governments
who
provide
services
like
schools
and
health
care
and
police
protection
that
cannot
fall
victim
to
this
latest
recession
another
thumb
on
the
scales
the
world
is
in
economic
turmoil

much
of
it
caused
by
american
financial
excesses

but
the
bush
administration
isnt
budging
from
its
antiregulatory
unfetteredmarketsknowbest
convictions
the
justice
departments
antitrust
division
has
published
a
new
set
of
guidelines
that
narrow
the
interpretation
of
abuse
that
would
justify
government
intervention
against
monopolies
it
is
a
deregulatory
gift
aimed
at
getting
pesky
antitrust
enforcers
off
of
the
back
of
big
business
the
new
doctrine
bends
over
backward
to
protect
big
firms
from
accusations
of
anticompetitive
behavior
it
requires
proof
that
the
harm
done
by
a
monopolists
actions

say
bundling
new
applications
into
a
computer
operating
system
to
keep
rival
software
makers
out

be
disproportionately
greater
than
the
potential
gains
to
consumers
if
a
dominant
firm
made
an
exclusive
deal
with
a
distributor
to
lock
out
a
competitor
it
would
be
illegal
only
if
the
competitor
were
denied
access
to
least
30
percent
of
the
market
if
a
dominant
company
used
discounts
as
a
tactic
to
smother
competition
it
could
get
off
the
hook
if
it
let
its
smaller
competitor
survive
even
if
only
barely
rivals
continued
presence
in
the
market
casts
serious
doubt
on
the
existence
of
anticompetitive
effects
the
report
says
the
department
of
justices
antitrust
division
is
supposed
to
be
the
agency
looking
out
for
the
interests
of
american
consumers
not
big
companies

a
role
it
has
clearly
forgotten
over
the
last
eight
years
throughout
the
entire
bush
administration
it
has
not
brought
a
single
case
against
a
dominant
firm
for
anticompetitive
behavior
and
it
has
argued
enthusiastically
on
behalf
of
monopolists
before
the
supreme
court
over
the
last
decade
and
a
half
the
court
also
has
bought
into
the
creed
that
unregulated
markets
selfcorrect
and
it
has
become
extremely
wary
of
government
intervention
against
monopolistic
firms
but
even
the
federal
trade
commission
declined
to
support
the
justice
departments
new
guidelines
chairman
william
kovacic
a
republican
said
he
doubted
that
big
companies
needed
more
protection
from
regulators
the
three
other
commissioners

a
democrat
a
republican
and
an
independent

said
the
report
placed
a
thumb
on
the
scales
in
favor
of
firms
with
monopoly
or
nearmonopoly
power
and
against
other
equally
significant
stakeholders
fortunately
the
next
administration
can
ignore
this
report
it
should
the
lesson
of
the
last
eight
years
is
that
unfettered
markets
dont
always
know
best
government
regulation
must
play
a
crucial
part
to
ensure
that
fair
competition
prevails
a
flawed
assessment
of
bpa
after
reports
of
a
possible
conflict
of
interest
we
worried
that
a
scientific
advisory
panel
might
pull
its
punches
in
evaluating
the
food
and
drug
administrations
judgments
on
the
safety
of
bisphenola
known
as
bpa
it
didnt
in
a
devastating
new
report
the
panel
charged
that
a
draft
safety
assessment
prepared
by
the
fda
ignored
relevant
studies
used
flawed
methodology
and
created
a
false
sense
of
security
about
the
safety
of
bpa
which
is
found
in
baby
bottles
plastic
water
bottles
and
the
liners
of
cans
among
other
products
the
draft
assessment
had
concluded
that
the
small
amounts
of
bpa
that
leach
into
milk
or
food
are
not
dangerous
the
advisory
panel
did
not
directly
dispute
this
but
it
left
little
doubt
that
the
weight
of
the
evidence
in
its
view
suggests
the
need
for
a
much
greater
safety
margin
than
the
fda
draft
deemed
adequate
the
us
national
toxicology
program

which
considered
many
of
the
studies
the
fda
had
discounted

has
expressed
some
concern
about
bpas
safety
and
canada
has
moved
toward
banning
the
sale
of
baby
bottles
made
with
bpa
some
research
suggests
that
bpa
might
cause
neurological
damage
accelerate
puberty
interfere
with
chemotherapy
and
increase
the
risk
for
heart
disease
diabetes
and
cancer
the
fdas
science
board
an
advisory
group
endorsed
the
panels
critique
on
friday
now
it
is
imperative
that
the
fda
complete
a
more
rigorous
assessment
it
must
also
consider
whether
to
restrict
some
uses
of
bpa
without
waiting
for
further
research

stunt
it
ought
to
have
lasted
for
half
a

cycle
especially
after
it
became
clear
that
wurzelbachers
taxes
would
go
down
under

plan
but
the

simply
will
not
let

go

this

wurzelbacher
was

agreeing
with

supporter
that
electing

would
be
death
to
israel
for
five
painful
liveonfox
minutes
the
next
day
smith
repeatedly
asked
wurzelbacher
what
evidence
he
had
to
back
up
that
charge
wurzelbacher
refused
to
answer
he
said
it
was
up
to
smiths
viewers
to
figure
out
why
he
joe
the
plumber
thought
obama
was
a
menace
to

looking
incredulous

gave
up
he
read
a
statement
from

campaign
praising
the

penetrating
and
clear
analysis
then
smith
said
i
just
want
to
make
this
100
percent
perfectly
clear
barack
obama
has
said
repeatedly
and
demonstrated
repeatedly
that
israel
will
always
be
a

of

no

once

liked
to
tell
the
story
of
what
happened
when
he
wrote
his
first
novel
the
blessing

in
1970
his
first
agent
advised
him
that
if

it
he
would
have
to
get
rid
of
all
that

hillerman

at

at

home
in

wrote
18
novels
about
all
that
indian

that
have
sold
millions
of
copies
around
the
world
made
him
a
beloved
figure
among
american
indians
and
nonindians
alike
and
brought
countless
readers
to
the
southwest
to
experience
the
harshly
beautiful
land
he
wrote
about
with
such
lyrical
passion
ive
long
been
among
his
fans
i
lived
in
the
southwest
for
10
years
and
when
im
missing
it
a
rereading
of
any
of
his
18
mysteries
featuring
navajo
tribal
police
officers
joe
leaphorn
and
jim
chee
is
enough
to
take
me
there
for
a
while
while
i
was
a
book
editor
in
tucson
ariz
i
was
lucky
enough
to
meet
hillerman
a
few
times
and
he
entirely
lived
up
to
his
reputation
as
a
gentleman
supportive
of
other
writers
unpretentious
about
his
own
success
and
expert
in
all
things
related
to
the
southwests
native
people
at
a
book
signing
he
caught

of
my

from
across

hopi
he
asked
guessing
correctly
the
origin
of
the
design
of
trickster

kokopelli
among
cornstalks
nice
piece
he
said
with
a
nod
hillermans
knowledge
about
the
native
people
of
the
southwest
was
both
scholarly
and
personal
he
researched
their
cultures
and
histories
but
he
also
knew
them
as
individuals
he
wrote
about
many
of
the
tribes
that
live
in
the
four
corners
area
where
new
mexico
arizona
colorado
and
utah
meet
but
his
focus
was
the
navajo
or
dineh
people
the
navajo
nation
is
the
largest
indian
tribe
in
the
united
states
with
almost
300000
members
about
180000
of
them
live
in

covers
about
27000

the

with
everything
around
you
and
the
intrusion
of

although
he
was
not
an
indian
hillerman
came
by
his

retiring
in

he
was
in

40s
when
he
wrote
his
first
novel
and
fortunately
for
readers
he
ignored
that
agents
advice
his
first
four
novels
centered
on
lt
joe
leaphorn
a
nononsense
rationalist
with
a
masters
degree
in
anthropology
and
a
cynical
view
of
what
he
considers

interwove

real
that
they
have

honors
over
the
course
of
his
career
including
being
named
a
grandmaster
by
the
mystery
writers
of

in

but
he
said
that
his
favorite
award
was
being
named

aliceas
rejection
of

the

the
races
in

than
they
have

would
not

change
the

analysts

the

has
tightened
his

so
much
that
the

a

calls
it
a
pure
toss

the

martinez
and

have
run
wellfunded
campaigns
with
advertising
on

a

the

have
countered
attacks
from

spanishlanguage
radio
in

that
have
branded
them
as
traitors
to
the
cuban

cause
one
tv
ad
titled

portrays
martinez
as
mired
in
repeated
scandals
including
a
1991
public

case
for
which
he
was
convicted
in
federal
court
the
verdict
was
later
overturned
and
subsequent
retrials
ended
in

juries
martinez
hit
back
with
a
questionable
ad
that
tried
to
tie
diazbalart
to
a
suitcase
with
50000
in
illegal
campaign
contributions
from
a
crooked
politician
the
democrats
have
sent
11million

a
steady

said
carlos
curbelo
who
advises
the
diazbalarts
he
cited
a
spanish

tv
poll
two
weeks
ago
that
showed
lincoln
diazbalart
with
a
14
percent
lead
and
his
brother
ahead
by
7
points
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
cubaless
campaign
hurts
the
diazbalarts
who
have
built
their
careers
on
tightening
the
screws
on
cubas
communist
regime
a
recent
university
of
miami
survey
found
that
cubanamerican
voters
remain
very
conservative
on
us
foreign
policy
toward
cuba
but
are
more
liberal
on
social
issues
while
polls
show
older
cuban
exiles
still
strongly
favor
republicans
younger

cubanamericans
tend
to
be
more
swayed
by
economic
and
breadandbutter
issues
said
amandi
polls
show
a
majority
of
cubanamericans
under
45
voting
democrat
pollsters
say
cuba
barely
makes
the
top
10
issues
of
most
concern
to
cubanamerican
voters
the
absence
of
cuba
from
the
campaign
was
no
big
surprise
according
to
curbelo
the
voters
know
where
everybody
stands
on
cuba
its
not
something
we
need
to
spend
our
resources
on
he
said
indeed
all
the
candidates
support
the
main
elements
of

martinez

oppose
current

for

death
was
the

part
gaining

was
regardless
of
rank
a
journey
that
makes

look
like
a
walk

and
though
they
could
not

definitely

egyptian
treasures
from
the
brooklyn
museum
at
the
john
and
mable
ringling
museum
of
art
more
than
100
objects
spanning
4000
years
illustrate
the
evolution
of
a
complex
system
of
beliefs
and
rituals
regarding
the
departure
from
this
life
and
entry
into
the
next
the
twist
is
that
the
exhibition
generally
looks
at
the
perspective
of
people
of
more
modest
means
were
used
to
seeing
the
whizbang
regalia
of
pharaohs
but
what
about
the
egyptian
equivalent
of
joe
the
plumber
who
cared
just
as
much
about
immortality
as
king
tut
we
see
how
those
lower
on
the
food
chain
emulated
as
best
they
could
the
surface
feeders
and
understand
that
it
wasnt
just
for
show
how
one
was
buried
and
with
what
accoutrements
were
literally
life
and
death
issues
amassing
the
money
needed
to
pay
for
a
proper
sendoff
could
take
years
preservation
of
the
body
was
paramount
as
was
specific
identification
by
name
different
levels
of
mummification
were
available
and
whether
you
got
the
full
treatment
in
which
most
of
the
organs
were
removed
and
everything
encased
in
resin
or
a
simple
washandwrap
job
depended
on
your
budget
the
heart
considered
to
control
thought
and
emotion
was
left
in
the
body
the
brain
not
believed
to
have
value
was
destroyed
in
this
show
a
man
named
demetrios
was
someone
of
means
his
remains
are
stored
in
goldwashed
linen
and
his
portrait
painted
in
encaustic
is
fitted
on
his
head
not
so
lucky
was
the
stonecutter
who
could
afford
only
a
wooden
tag
inscribed
with
his
name
presumably
his
body
was
not
embalmed
as
elaborately
as
demetrios
so
his
body
was
lost
to
time
the
goal
was
to
arrive
in
the
netherworld
beneath
the
earth
undertake
a
perilous
journey
by
boat
avoid
the
onslaughts
of
demons
and
find
an
advantageous
spot
to
settle
down
permanently
the
body
was
needed
to
act
as
a
sort
of
template
for
the
souls
resettlement
which
took
on
a
life
of
its
own
the
soul
was
able
to
function
corporeally
after
death
eating
and
drinking
and
traveling
a
fear
was
that
it
would
take
off
and
not
return
to
the
body
so
there
were
ritual
chants
and
amulets
that
discouraged
such
truancy
those
with
the
means
had
tablets
inscribed
with
incantations
and
descriptions
from
the
book
of
the
dead
for
every
stage
of
the
journey
a
cheat
sheet
in
case
they
were
unprepared
examples
of
these
objects
are
in
the
show
along
with
a
papyrus
fragment
from
the
book
a
coffin
was
essential
to
this
journey
acting
as
a
protective
case
and
safe
haven
for
the
soul
in
the
netherworld
its
importance
was
based
on
the
myth
of
osiris

the
first
king
of
egypt
who
was
murdered
by
his
brother
seth
sometimes
spelled
set
by
sealing
him
in
a
coffin
made
to
fit
his
body
perfectly
and
throwing
it
in
the
nile
osiris
wife
isis
found
the
coffin
and
managed
to
revive
him
long
enough
to
conceive
a
son
horus

who
eventually
defeated
seth
osiris
continued
to
the
netherworld
and
ruled
as
its
king
the
evolution
of
the
myth
embroidered
with
more
elaborations
through
the
centuries
was
the
prototype
for
all
egyptian
funerals
the
wood
coffin
for
example
was
constructed
to
resemble
a
human
shape
and
painted
with
references
to
osiris
who
passed
judgment
on
all
who
entered
the
afterlife
a
curious
custom
that
seems
to
have
become
common
was
the
recycling
of
funeral
objects
even
pharaohs
were
not
above
the
practice
scholars
believe
king
tuts
coffin
was
originally
made
for
an
earlier
wealthier
king
there
are
several
examples
of
this
repurposing
and
the
intriguing
unresolved
question
of
how
egyptians
reconciled
their
reverence
for
custom
with
the
practicalities
of
economy
unlike
other
large
shows
of
egyptian
antiquities
i
have
seen
this
one
is
not
intended
to
inspire
awe
it
gives
us
a
sense
of
how
real
people
coped
with
the
exigencies
of
life
and
aspirations
in
death
because
so
much
time
is
covered
we
also
see
how
many
practices
changed
and
though
it
dwells
on
the
nonrich
a
lot
most
of
the
objects
belonged
to
those
with
some
means
the
poorest
people
probably
could
not
afford
even
a
simple
coffin
the
brooklyn
museum
which
organized
the
show
from
its
own
enormous
worldfamous
collection
sent
few
objects
made
of
precious
metals
and
gems
but
i
really
like
the
show
it
has
a
clear
mission
and
makes
sense
of
the
carved
stones
and
old
statues
that
tend
to
make
our
eyes
glaze

nicole

31
a
paralegal
with
two
young
children
you
have
two
minutes
go
oliver
knew
that
her
family
leaned
republican
because
she
was
on
his
getoutthevote
list
and
he
rapidly
delivered
a
pitch
honed
over
22
years
of
volunteering
for
local
campaigns
wow
youre
good
she
said
and
as
she
drove
away
oliver
smiled
with
satisfaction
but
did
he
really
win
her
over
ellington
had
pointed
to
the
palin
on
his
tshirt
and
said
im
worried
about
this
one
i
dont
know
oliver
said
after
giving
it
some
thought
she
may
have
been
being
polite
oliver
47
a
real
estate
lawyer
who
walks
and
talks
in
bursts
is
the
kind
of
party
regular
who
is
not
usually
one
to
doubt
he
has
been
the
orange
county
republican
party
chairman
since
1999
and
with
his
encyclopedic
knowledge
of
the
neighborhoods
and
demographics
of
orlando
he
built
the
grassroots
effort
that
pushed
george
w
bush
to
victory
here
and
statewide
in
2000
and
2004
but
this
year
oliver
said
the
challenge
is
tougher
part
of
it
is
the
collapse
of
the
economy
of
the
western
world
he
said
part
is
the
competition
a
campaign
by
sen
barack
obama
that
has
poured
more
money
and
people
into
the
state
than
sen
john
mccain
has
even
the
most
seasoned
republicans
now
acknowledge
that
they
face
an
uphill
fight
this
is
as
difficult
an
environment
for
republicans
as
theres
been
since
watergate
said
george
lemieux
the
former
campaign
manager
for
gov
charlie
crist
a
republican
oliver
agrees
and
like
many
republicans
trying
in
the
final
days
to
push
their
party
to
victory
he
says
he
has
found
inspiration
in
mccain
the
perseverant
prisoner
of
war
who
came
from
behind
to
seize
the
republican
nomination
the
current
call
to
arms
is
simple
if
anyone
can
pull
it
off
its
john
mccain
the
same
could
be
said
for
oliver
even
his
counterparts
in
the
local
democratic
party
describe
him
as
one
of
the
best
organizers
in
florida
a
tireless
terrier
of
campaigns
who
has
missed
only
four
of
the
county
partys
meetings
in
22
years
oliver
claims
to
dislike
politics
seeing
it
as
a
way
to
fulfill
the
civic
duty
that
led
his
father
and
two
brothers
to
the
military
but
he
is
single
and
admits
that
the
republican
party
consumes
much
of
his
free
time
on
thursday
his
day
began
at
9
am
calling
his
orlando
neighbors
from
a
phone
bank
list
he
carries
everywhere
so
he
can
reach
voters
during
down
times
by
10
am
he
was
inside
a
local
tv
news
studio
where
he
debated
the
race
with
the
local
democratic
party
chairman
on
camera
oliver
emphasized
that
no
one
is
giving
up
he
said
that
the
polls
were
close
in
florida
and
that
slight
movement
could
bring
victory
during
a
commercial
break
though
he
quoted
bill
clinton
its
the
economy
stupid
and
said
if
i
had
a
videotape
of
barack
obama
shooting
someone
hed
still
be
up
in
the
polls
what
really
frustrated
him
he
said
was
that
voters
did
not
seem
to
be
recognizing
what
he
admired
about
john
mccain
his
pragmatism
his
toughness
his
proven
willingness
to
buck
his
party
and
reach
across
the
aisle
on
tough
issues
like
immigration
but
lately
olivers
task
has
become
complicated
as
he
finds
himself
competing
with
a
burning
fear
voiced
by
some
mccain
supporters
it
can
be
seen
in
the
antiobama
book
at
the
mccain
office
in
altamonte
springs
or
in
maitland
where
someone
posted
a
letter
on
the
wall
that
said
this
is
the
scariest
election
we
as
christians
have
ever
faced
and
from
the
looks
of
the
polls
the
christians
arent
voting
christian
values
just
a
few
feet
away
a
larger
poster
near
an
american
flag
stated
obama

too
dangerous
for
our
america
oliver
when
told
about
the
messages
said
they
did
not
reflect
the
partys
official
position
and
would
be
taken
down
at
the
orlando
headquarters
where
he
usually
spends
his
time
no
such
language
was
visible
but
in
an
unscientific
show
of
hands
among
30
volunteers
more
people
said
they
were
motivated
by
a
fear
of
obama
than
by
a
love
of
mccain
or
gov
sarah
palin
such
passions
are
doubleedged
some
party
officials
worry
that
the
negative
tone
alienates
independent
voters
on
the
other
hand
it
has
pushed
volunteers
to
great
lengths
about
half
of
the
volunteers
at
the
headquarters
had
come
from
outside
florida
representing
at
least
eight
states
including
alaska
georgia
and
texas
many
said
they
were
volunteering
for
the
first
time
spending
as
much
as
2000
of
their
own
money
to
try
to
keep
the
democrats
from
winning
krista
parrett
37
said
she
came
from
syracuse
to
volunteer
because
she
feared
that
an
obama
victory
would
make
the
united
states
like
uzbekistan
a
former
soviet
state
ruled
with
an
iron
fist
where
she
once
lived
marlene
heineman
58
a
flight
attendant
who
had
come
to
the
office
during
a
long
layover
said
she
worried
about
who
might
be
behind
obamas
rapid
rise
to
prominence
he
has
a
lot
of
shady
connections
heineman
said
he
hasnt
been
forthcoming
other
interviews
brought
similar
sentiments
though
one
volunteer
michael
walzak
46
a
member
of
the
countys
republican
executive
committee
said
he
was
disappointed
that
so
many
people
are
that
fearful
oliver
for
his
part
has
stayed
focused
on
what
he
knows
how
to
win
at
330
pm
he
returned
from
his
law
office
speeding
into
the
campaign
headquarters
in
nike
running
sneakers
and
jeans
with
not
just
a
mccainpalin
shirt
but
also
a
hat
the
operation
had
just
shifted
from
asking
voters
if
they
had
received
and
sent
in
their
absentee
ballots
to
the
getoutthevote
effort
this
twopronged
emphasis
on
absentee
ballots
and
getting
voters
to
the
polls
has
been
the
partys
focus
in
florida
for
decades
oliver
said
that
it
works
in
part
because
republicans
tend
to
be
less
transient
than
democrats
making
them
easier
to
reach
and
because
they
have
historically
been
more
loyal
to
their
party
as
an
example
he
said
that
81
percent
of
registered
republicans
in
orange
county
voted
in
2004
compared
with
about
75
percent
of
democrats
to
try
to
continue
that
tradition
oliver
grabbed
a
list
of
181
addresses
in
baldwin
park
an
area
of
working
professionals
the
first
house
he
visited
took
him
to
james
sims
50
who
said
he
was
happy
to
see
fellow
mccain
supporters
in
the
neighborhood
the
second
voter
he
encountered
also
promised
to
vote
republican
no
matter
how
sick
you
are
oliver
said
even
if
you
have
to
drag
yourself
there
on
a
wagon
yes
the
woman
said
it
was
a
wellhoned
pitch
in
his
22
years
he
said
he
had
learned
a
few
things
about
voter
contact
first
knock
and
ring
the
doorbell
second
step
a
few
feet
back
to
avoid
looking
threatening
and
third
use
humor
introductions
like
hi

big
smile

were
not
selling
anything
are
usually
effective
or
at
least
they
get
the
conversation
going
what
happens
next
this
year
at
least
seems
more
unpredictable
just
after
oliver
said
he
had
not
yet
found
a
house
with
republicans
who
said
they
would
vote
for
barack
obama
he
encountered
two
of
them
in
a
row
beth
moriarty
said
that
her
62yearold
husband
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
was
going
to
vote
for
a
democrat
patricia
millar
50
a
registered
independent
also
said
that
she
and
her
husband
jeffery
bergenthal
a
republican
were
not
voting
for
mccain
a
blue
obama
sign
fluttered
in
her
lawn
she
seemed
unsure
of
how
to
break
the
news
we
think
hes
a
great
guy
she
said
of
mccain
were
just
a
little
disappointed
with
the
ticket
this
year
no
one
disputes
that
icelands
economic
troubles
are
largely
the
countrys
own
fault
but
there
may
be
more
to
the
story
at
least
in
the
view
of
icelands
government
its
citizens
and
even
some
outsiders
as
grave
as
their
situation
already
was
they
say
britain

their
old
friend
nato
ally
and
trading
partner

made
it
immeasurably
worse
the
troubles
between
the
countries
began
three
weeks
ago
when
britain
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
using
its
2001
antiterrorism
laws
to
freeze
the
british
assets
of
a
failing
icelandic
bank
that
appeared
to
brand
iceland
a
terrorist
state
i
must
admit
that
i
was
absolutely
appalled
the
icelandic
foreign
minister
ingibjorg
solrun
gisladottir
said
in
an
interview
describing
her
horror
at
opening
the
british
treasury
departments
home
page
at
the
time
and
finding
iceland
on
a
list
of
terrorist
entities
with
alqaida
sudan
and
north
korea
among
others
in
a
volatile
economic
climate
in
which
appearance
matters
almost
as
much
as
reality
being
associated
with
terrorism
is
not
a
good
thing
the
immediate
effect
was
to
trigger
an
almost
complete
freeze
on
any
banking
transactions
between
iceland
and
abroad
said
jon
danielsson
an
economist
at
the
london
school
of
economics
when
youre
labeled
a
terrorist
nobody
does
business
with
you
the
icelandic
prime
minister
geir
h
haarde
accused
britain
of
bullying
a
small
neighbor
and
said
the
action
was
very
out
of
proportion
in
a
recent
speech
in
beijing
howard
davies
a
former
deputy
governor
of
the
bank
of
england
and
now
the
director
of
the
london
school
of
economics
said
that
britain
had
used
a
beggar
thy
neighbor
approach
to
iceland
and
an
online
petition
signed
so
far
by
more
than
20
percent
of
icelands
population
said
the
british
prime
minister
gordon
brown
had
sacrificed
iceland
for
his
own
shortterm
political
gain
thereby
turning
a
grave
situation
into
a
national
disaster
icelands
financial
problems
had
been
brewing
for
some
time
this
past
spring
the
countrys
banks
bloated
with
foreign
deposits
and
debts
began
to
falter
this
fall
as
the
financial
crisis
deepened
the
government
took
over
two
of
the
countrys
three
largest
banks
the
british
government
alarmed
about
the
tens
of
thousands
of
accounts
held
by
its
citizens
companies
local
governments
and
charities
froze
the
british
assets
of
one
of
the
failed
banks
landsbanki
it
also
seized
the
assets
of
kaupthing
singer
ampamp
friedlander
the
british
subsidiary
of
another
icelandic
bank
kaupthing
the
icelandic
government
believe
it
or
not
told
me
yesterday
that
they
have
no
intention
of
honoring
their
obligations
here
alistair
darling
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
declared
the
day
britain
seized
the
assets
the
icelandic
government
disputed
that
saying
it
was
merely
asking
for
time
to
make
good
on
its
obligations
whatever
the
case
reaction
was
immediate
and
severe
particularly
when
brown
said
the
following
day

inaccurately

that
we
are
freezing
the
assets
of
icelandic
companies
in
the
uk
where
we
can
icelands
ambassador
to
britain
sverrir
h
gunnlaugsson
said
in
an
interview
that
this
statement
was
particularly
damaging
there
was
a
perception
in
the
uk
press
and
among
suppliers
that
everything
icelandic
had
been
frozen
he
said
the
word
was
put
out
belatedly
that
this
was
not
the
case
icelanders
say
that
it
is
now
nearly
impossible
to
get
foreign
currency
into
or
out
of
the
country
many
banks
have
refused
even
to
transfer
money
to
iceland
importers
are
having
difficulty
paying
their
foreign
bills
and
exporters
are
having
trouble
getting
paid
by
their
foreign
customers
many
people
in
iceland
are
also
furious
about
what
happened
to
kaupthing
singer
ampamp
friedlander
the
british
governments
seizure
of
its
assets
precipitated
the
immediate
collapse
of
its
parent
bank
kaupthing
which
the
icelandic
government
had
been
propping
up
and
had
hoped
would
survive
kaupthing
was
the
last
best
hope
of
the
icelandic
banking
system
and
it
was
killed
there
and
then
andres
magnusson
an
editorial
writer
for
icelandic
financial
news
said
in
an
interview
this
really
was
the
last
straw
a
lot
of
icelanders
are
asking
excuse
me
whos
the
terrorist
here
the
banks
collapse
had
repercussions
beyond
iceland
and
britain
more
than
8000
depositors
individuals
and
businesses
hold
kaupthing
singer
ampamp
friedlander
accounts
worth
about
134
billion
on
the
isle
of
man
money
they
now
cannot
get
their
hands
on

and
may
never
iceland
is
in
line
to
receive
a
2
billion
loan
from
the
international
monetary
fund
and
is
talking
to
other
scandinavian
countries
it
is
not
entirely
friendless
it
was
recently
offered
a
loan
of
about
52
million
from
the
tiny
faroe
islands
for
which
it
is
very
grateful
gunnlaugsson
said
the
icelandic
government
has
pledged
to
make
good
on
domestic
bank
accounts
but
it
is
still
fighting
with
britain
over
how
much
it
is
obliged
to
pay

and
how
much
it
can
afford
to
pay

to
compensate
customers
with
accounts
in
icesave
landsbankis
british
branch
under
european
regulations
iceland
is
obliged
to
pay
20000
euros
about
25000
to
each
individual
account
holder
in
icesave
but
the
total
gisladottir
the
foreign
minister
said
would
amount
to
about
600
billion
icelandic
kronur

only
about
5
billion
at
todays
collapsed
exchange
rate
but
fully
60
percent
of
icelands
gross
domestic
product
the
compensation
that
we
would
give
would
be
twice
as
much
per
head
as
the
reparations
germany
faced
in
the
treaty
of
versailles
after
the
first
world
war
she
said
that
is
something
we
cannot
afford
the
british
government
has
guaranteed
that
individual
british
account
holders
will
be
compensated
fully
which
is
why
it
is
seeking
to
wrest
as
much
money
as
possible
from
iceland
but
no
such
guarantees
have
been
made
to
the
british
companies
local
governments
charities
and
universities

including
oxford
and
cambridge

that
had
icesave
accounts
that
figure
alone
is
well
over
1
billion
dollars
icelands
key
interest
rate
now
stands
at
18
percent
the
currency
the
krona
has
declined
44
percent
in
the
last
year
danielsson
the
economist
visited
the
country
recently
and
found
the
situation
grave
salaries
are
frozen
food
prices
are
shooting
up
and
they
are
laying
off
people
left
right
and
center
he
said
companies
are
going
bankrupt
all
over
the
place
its
unimaginable
how
bad
it
is
gisladottir
said
britains
decision
had
sent
iceland
back
some
30
or
40
years
to
a
time
when
it
was
an
isolated
poor
country
dependent
mostly
on
its
fishing
trade
this
is
a
major
crisis
she
said
we
havent
been
in
this
situation
for
probably
ever
we
cannot
solve
it
alone
we
need
solidarity
from
partners
from
friendly
countries
and
we
thought
the
uk
was
one
of
them
sens
barack
obama
and
john
mccain
have
stood
or
sat
for
36
debates
endured
thousands
of
interviews
and
spent
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
on
advertisements
and
the
better
part
of
two
years
trying
to
convince
voters
that
they
are
worthy
of
the
presidency
or
at
least
a
vote
but
with
only
days
left
until
election
day
a
small
cluster
of
holdouts

4
percent
according
to
a
new
york
timescbs
news
poll

is
still
wrestling
with
the
who
are
you
voting
for
question
which
raises
a
followup
what
is
up
with
these
people
i
do
not
like
being
an
undecided
said
a
sheepish
doug
finke
a
66yearold
executive
at
an
international
relocation
service
in
louisville
ky
last
time
at
this
point
i
definitely
was
decided
not
this
time
i
find
it
unnerving
doug
finke
a
republican
voted
twice
for
george
w
bush
he
describes
himself
as
an
economic
conservative
and
said
he
had
been
very
impressed
with
sen
john
mccain
it
sure
sounds
as
if
finke
is
leaning
toward
mccain
the
arizona
republican
right
not
so
fast
im
socially
more
liberal
doug
finke
said
i
think
obama
is
bright
and
has
been
very
steady
in
this
campaign
he
added
that
it
would
be
very
exciting
for
the
united
states
to
elect
a
black
president
besides
he
does
not
think
mccains
running
mate
gov
sarah
palin
of
alaska
would
be
ready
to
step
into
the
top
job
if
something
happened
to
mccain
who
finke
pointed
out
is
pretty
old
where
does
this
leave
doug
finke
i
plan
on
doing
a
lot
of
reading
this
weekend
he
said
if
the
country
is
divided
between
red
and
blue
doug
finke
resides
in
a
gray
state
along
with
a
proud

or
embarrassed

corps
of
undecideds
they
are
a
shrinking
cohort
of
confused
procrastinating
indifferent
or
just
plain
indecisive
consumers
of
democracy
doug
finke
lives
in
a
red
state
kentucky
with
his
wife
shelley
who
is
also
a
gray
state
citizen
she
works
out
of
their
home
where
she
helps
manage
her
husbands
second
career
as
a
jazz
trombonist
i
tend
to
be
a
procrastinator
said
shelley
finke
44
who
said
she
operated
best
with
deadlines
she
voted
for
bush
twice
and
describes
herself
as
a
conservative
person
at
heart
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
she
was
suspicious
of
obama
because
of
the
whole
hollywood
thing
but
she
has
since
warmed
to
him
my
opinion
of
obama
has
definitely
risen
during
this
campaign
shelley
finke
said
and
my
opinion
of
mccain
has
fallen
so
it
sure
sounds
as
if
shelley
finke
is
moving
toward
obama
the
illinois
democrat
right
not
so
fast
id
say
im
leaning
towards
mccain
she
said
for
as
awful
as
things
are
with
this
republican
administration
theres
something
about
the
whole
conservative
thing
that
appeals
to
me
put
her
down
as
leaning
mccain
then
but
maybe
ill
vote
for
obama
she
said
how
many
days
are
left
two
as
of
sunday
while
many
people
in
this
campaignsaturated
country
are
relieved
that
the
election
will
soon
be
over
some
of
the
undecideds
figure
whats
the
rush
i
might
flip
a
coin
said
vasilios
gerovasiliou
64
of
concordville
pa
his
two
grown
sons

like
him
veterinarians

are
split
along
party
lines
his
wife
helen
said
she
was
disgusted
with
both
sides
gerovasiliou
who
emigrated
from
greece
35
years
ago
said
there
were
things
he
liked
about
both
mccain
and
obama
but
he
also
believes
that
neither
of
the
candidates
always
speaks
the
truth
and
that
none
of
them
will
be
able
to
do
all
of
the
things
they
are
promising
gerovasiliou
supported
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
loved
bill
clinton
and
pretty
much
vowed
to
support
anyone
not
named
barack
obama
after
he
defeated
clinton
in
the
democratic
primaries
but
the
clintons
endorsement
of
obama
went
a
long
way
time
healed
things
gerovasiliou
said
plus
he
likes
obamas
running
mate
sen
joseph
r
biden
jr
of
neighboring
delaware
who
is
friends
with
a
lot
of
the
greeks
around
here
and
patronizes
the
local
greek
diners
he
likes
mccain
too
however
he
admires
his
service
patriotism
and
grit
and
also
likes
that
palin
comes
from
a
small
town
just
as
he
did
from
one
in
greece
would
he
really
flip
a
coin
no
he
would
not
i
will
just
have
to
make
a
decision
gerovasiliou
said
by
the
end
of
a
15minute
phone
interview
he
sounded
a
little
closer
to
making
one
i
think
i
am
leaning
a
little
bit
to
someone
now
he
said
and
that
would
be
biden
talking
does
not
necessarily
bring
undecideds
closer
to
deciding
the
more
i
chat
the
more
confused
i
get
said
laura
wolpo
a
brooklyn
native
who
lives
in
palm
beach
gardens
fla
she
was
fresh
from
a
golf
outing
that
was
filled
with
political
conversation
and
left
her
head
spinning
people
get
so
wacky
about
this
stuff
she
said
wolpo
76
has
usually
picked
a
candidate
by
the
end
of
the
conventions
that
was
the
democrats
al
gore
in
2000
and
john
kerry
in
2004
obama
i
have
great
misgivings
she
said
we
are
of
the
jewish
faith
she
said
and
i
dont
really
know
his
stance
on
the
middle
east
and
israel
she
also
worries
about
his
share
the
wealth
ideas
and
says
michelle
obama
comes
on
a
little
too
strong
and
someone
should
teach
her
how
to
dress
too
mccain
i
like
the
man
she
said
i
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
him
but
she
has
problems
with
him
too
some
big
ones
first
she
is
a
strong
believer
in
abortion
rights
which
mccain
is
not
the
government
does
not
belong
in
our
bedroom
she
said
and
then
there
is
palin
oh
my
god
wolpo
said
some
of
what
she
says
is
very
stupid
wolpo
vows
to
vote
tuesday
she
raises
the
possibility
of
a
toss
of
the
coin
but
then
rejects
the
notion
when
pressed
wolpo
said
there
was
probably
a
60
percent
chance
she
would
support
mccain
she
does
not
buy
the
obama
campaign
argument
that
mccain
is
just
like
bush
mccain
knows
in
his
heart
that
bush
is
a
loser
she
said
either
way
wolpo
said
her
decision
did
not
keep
her
awake
at
night
i
have
enough
to
worry
about
she
said
explaining
that
her
youngest
son
who
is
in
his
40s
suffered
a
stroke
last
spring
he
has
good
days
and
bad
days
she
said
and
that
puts
everything
else
in
perspective
this
other
thing
is
just
an
election
she
said
on
a
rainy
friday
evening
in
early
august
six
taliban
fighters
attacked
a
police
post
in
a
village
in
buner
a
quiet
farming
valley
just
outside
pakistans
lawless
tribal
region
the
militants
tied
up
eight
policemen
and
lay
them
on
the
floor
and
according
to
local
accounts
the
youngest
member
of
the
gang
a
14yearold
shot
the
captives
on
orders
from
his
boss
the
fighters
stole
uniforms
and
weapons
and
fled
into
the
mountains
almost
instantly
the
people
of
buner
armed
with
rifles
daggers
and
pistols
formed
a
posse
and
after
five
days
they
cornered
and
killed
their
quarry
a
video
made
on
a
cell
phone
showed
the
six
militants
lying
in
the
dirt
blood
oozing
from
their
wounds
the
stand
at
buner
has
entered
the
lore
of
pakistans
war
against
the
militants
as
a
dramatic
example
of
ordinary
citizens
determination
to
draw
a
line
against
the
militants
but
it
says
as
much
about
the
shortcomings
of
pakistans
increasingly
overwhelmed
police
forces
and
the
pellmell
nature
of
the
efforts
to
stop
the
militants
who
week
by
week
seem
to
seep
deeper
into
pakistan
from
their
tribal
strongholds
since
the
events
in
buner
the
inspector
general
of
the
police
in
the
northwest
frontier
province
malik
naveed
khan
has
encouraged
citizens
in
other
towns
and
villages
in
his
realm
to
form
posses
of
their
own
the
hope
is
that
determination
itself
will
deter
taliban
encroachment
building
on
the
august
victory
with
one
phalanx
after
another
of
committed
citizens
but
the
strategy
is
also
a
sign
of
his
desperation
we
are
laying
down
our
lives
khan
said
in
an
interview
in
october
by
the
hundreds
the
police
are
being
targeted
and
killed
he
has
had
to
lower
recruitment
standards
to
fill
out
the
ranks
he
said
because
this
is
war
even
so
he
has
supplemented
his
force
with
what
he
said
were
some
15000
special
police

citizens
whom
he
cannot
pay
but
whom
he
is
willing
to
arm
any
community
which
helps
us
we
give
them
weapons
khan
said
the
army
was
of
no
use
here
there
is
no
other
way
khan
said
pure
military
action
would
create
a
lot
of
devastation
to
the
extent
that
people
would
turn
against
the
government
indeed
after
the
taliban
were
cornered
a
new
peace
committee
composed
of
elders
and
politicians
passed
a
resolution
declaring
buner
a
zone
free
of
both
the
army
and
the
taliban
the
local
police
chief
in
the
buner
district
zubair
shah
a
rising
star
of
the
pakistani
police
force
acknowledged
the
challenges
of
confronting
a
taliban
threat
that
is
more
deeply
ensconced
in
communities
all
over
pakistan
than
had
been
thought
he
is
trying
to
tamp
down
the
taliban
with
a
police
force
that
is
grossly
underpaid
and
frequently
overmatched
by
better
armed
militants
currently
the
police
officers
in
buner
earn
about
onequarter
the
monthly
salary
that
the
taliban
are
offering
shah
said
moreover
given
that
the
police
have
become
a
primary
target
of
the
militants
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
morale
has
plummeted
the
people
are
more
motivated
than
the
police
he
said
in
the
tribal
areas
to
the
west
of
the
buner
district
the
pakistani
army
is
now
encouraging
tribal
militias
known
as
lashkars
as
a
backup
force
against
the
taliban
such
militias
have
a
long
tradition
in
tribal
society
but
even
there
they
have
met
with
little
success
in
the
current
conflict
by
contrast
posses
like
the
one
in
buner
have
not
been
tried
before
in
the
settled
parts
of
pakistan
outside
the
tribal
areas
khan
said
they
have
in
any
case
become
a
necessary
tool
to
help
preserve
the
peace
the
citizens
of
buner
interviewed
in
late
october
after
the
police
arranged
an
escort
to
the
area
where
security
is
still
sketchy
said
they
had
taken
matters
into
their
own
hands
to
keep
not
only
the
militants
at
bay
but
the
army
as
well
in
areas
where
the
army
has
had
to
confront
the
militants
fighting
has
ensued
on
the
scale
of
a
civil
war
displacing
tens
of
thousands
of
people
if
citizens
militias
sound
like
civil
war
already
that
is
precisely
what
the
people
of
buner
say
they
are
hoping
to
avoid
such
wrenching
violence
has
been
the
fate
already
of
the
neighboring
swat
valley
and
of
nearby
bajaur
an
area
of
the
tribal
region
where
the
army
and
militants
have
been
locked
in
heavy
fighting
civilian
casualties
are
high
the
task
of
pushing
back
the
taliban
is
taking
far
longer
than
the
army
had
anticipated
in
swat
the
army
has
been
unable
to
stop
the
burning
of
more
than
100
girls
schools
or
the
murders
of
politicians
and
their
families
about
onethird
of
the
police
force
has
deserted
in
swat
and
some
of
the
deserters
have
joined
the
taliban
even
as
trainers
according
to
senior
police
officials
in
bajaur
more
than
200000
people
have
fled
becoming
refugees
in
appalling
conditions
in
makeshift
camps
the
villagers
in
buner
say
they
would
prefer
to
handle
the
taliban
on
their
own
rather
than
have
the
heavy
hand
of
the
army
come
and
do
it
for
them
they
did
it
with
gusto
later
lining
up
the
bodies
of
their
taliban
victims
at
a
hospital
like
trophies
so
citizens
could
take
a
closer
look
we
dont
want
happening
here
what
is
happening
around
us
said
mohammed
zada
a
retired
bank
manager
and
a
driving
force
behind
the
peace
council
the
people
are
very
unified
so
the
taliban
failed
we
are
dead
set
against
the
army
too
while
the
resolve
of
local
residents
is
heartening
shah
an
expert
in
counterterrorism
understands
better
than
most
pakistanis
what
kind
of
threat
he
is
up
against
he
has
taught
police
investigative
work
with
the
united
nations
in
bosnia
and
was
selected
by
the
us
consulate
in
peshawar
for
a
monthlong
leadership
program
in
the
united
states
he
recently
spent
a
year
in
australia
studying
transnational
terrorism
as
in
many
areas
of
pakistan

from
karachi
to
islamabad
and
from
rural
districts
in
the
north
to
the
cultural
capital
lahore

the
taliban
have
sympathizers
and
workers
in
buner
who
lie
low
in
sleeper
cells
that
can
be
easily
activated
shah
said
soon
after
the
citizen
posse
killed
the
six
taliban
he
said
undercover
work
led
police
officers
to
a
house
where
they
found
a
suicide
vest
packed
with
20
pounds
of
explosives
and
15
pounds
of
ball
bearings
that
discovery
led
to
a
potentially
more
lethal
find
a
full
kit
of
ingredients
for
major
explosions
in
a
house
near
his
police
headquarters
investigators
found
more
than
500
pounds
of
explosives
a
cache
of
30
detonators
10
remotecontrol
devices
dozens
of
battery
cells
a
police
uniform
and
a
motorcycle
shah
said
worryingly
he
said
the
explosives
had
been
methodically
delivered
into
buner
over
time
in
small
parcels
by
motorbike
one
of
the
men
arrested
in
the
case
had
been
friendly
with
the
police
a
shopkeeper
who
prayed
at
the
same
mosque
as
the
police
many
of
the
villagers
in
buner
had
relatives
working
abroad

in
malaysia
in
dubai
and
as
taxi
drivers
in
arlington
va

who
sent
remittances
home
the
relative
wealth
and
a
longstanding
social
cohesion
had
helped
to
fortify
the
community
and
keep
the
taliban
at
bay
under
these
circumstances
the
police
chief
said
people
power
was
his
best
bet
if
the
militants
enter
buner
he
said
all
you
need
to
do
is
go
to
the
mosque
loudspeakers
and
shout
and
people
will
be
mobilized
facing
labor
shortages
back
in
1990
but
ever
wary
of
allowing
in
foreigners
japan
made
an
exception
for
japanesebrazilians
with
their
japanese
roots
names
and
faces
these
children
and
grandchildren
of
japanese
immigrants
to
brazil
would
fit
more
easily
in
a
society
fiercely
closed
to
outsiders
or
so
the
reasoning
went
in
the
two
decades
since
then
despite
periodic
economic
downturns
like
the
current
one
the
number
of
japanesebrazilian
workers
in
japan
has
kept
growing
they
are
clustered
in
industrial
regions
dotted
with
factories
supplying
familiar
companies
like
honda
sanyo
and
toyota
whose
headquarters
gave
this
city
in
central
japan
its
name
but
perhaps
nowhere
in
this
country
do
japanese
and
japanesebrazilians
rub
shoulders
with
such
intensity
as
in
a
public
housing
complex
here
called
homi
estate
built
in
the
1970s
for
young
japanese
families
homi
has
a
population
of
8891
that
is
now
nearly
evenly
split
between
japanese
at
52
percent
and
foreigners
at
48
percent
to
be
honest
toshinori

a
japanese
community
leader
said
i
never
imagined
in
my
wildest
dreams
that
this
would
ever
become
a
multiethnic
neighborhood
a
generation
from
now
more
japanese
are
likely
to
be
making
similar
comments
as
japans
population
ages
and
its
work
force
shrinks
recently
labor
shortages
have
spread
from
factories
to
farms
fishing
boats
hospitals
and
other
areas
prompting
japan
to
open
its
doors
to
temporary
workers
from
china
and
elsewhere
in
asia
as
the
demographic
squeeze
grows
tighter
japan
may
have
to
open
itself
further
to
immigration
experts
say
if
it
is
to
have
the
workers
it
needs
to
remain
a
major
industrial
power
a
homogeneous
and
insular
nation
however
japan
is
notoriously
unwelcoming
to
immigrants
koreans
who
came
here
during
world
war
ii
are
still
treated
as
secondclass
citizens
to
make
itself
an
attractive
destination
for
immigrants
the
experts
say
japan
will
have
to
undergo
a
difficult
cultural
transformation
for

japanesebrazilians

whose

are
growing

did
not

why
the

failed
to

perfectly

seemed

and
they
felt

ive
been
lucky
because
the
japanese
have
been
kind
to
me
said
rita
okokama
40
a
japanesebrazilian
who
has
been
here
18
years
and
owns
padaria
a
small
sandwich
shop
but
others
have
faced
prejudice
for
example
japanese
shop
owners
will
follow
around
japanesebrazilian
customers
because
they
think
theyll
shoplift
a
decade
ago
japanesebrazilians
even
clashed
with
japanese
rightwing
groups
singling
out
foreigners
but
the
situation
began
improving
five
years
ago
as
the
japanese
and
the
japanesebrazilians
learned
to
live
with
one
another
and
organized
joint
events
like
barbecues
said
kunikazu
ihara
65
a
local
ward
leader
another
reason
for
the
improvement
may
be
that
japanese
unwilling
to
live
next
to
japanesebrazilians
simply
moved
if
they
were
surrounded
by
foreigners
especially
those
in
rental
apartments
some
japanese
just
got
out
ihara
said
by
contrast
the
japanese
who
stayed
appeared
committed
to
getting
along
japanese
tend
to
be
insular
and
build
shells
around
themselves
said
kimio
yamamoto
71
a
retired
japanese
engineer
who
has
become
a
familiar
face
at
homis
japanesebrazilianrun
fitness
club
and
foreigners
can
feel
that
right
away
as
he
worked
on
his
pectorals
yamamoto
said
the
japanesebrazilians
had
immediately
made
him
feel
at
home
at
the
club
its
fun
he
said
still
most
adults
keep
a
polite
distance
from
one
another
children
become
amigos
said
fujiwara
the
japanese
community
leader
who
is
taking
portuguese
lessons
and
sprinkles
his
japanese
with
portuguese
words
but
adults
they
dont
become

at
west
homi
elementary
where
japanesebrazilian
children
account
for
53
percent
of
the
196
students
supplementary
japanese
language
classes
are
offered
as
well
as
help
in
other
subjects
partly
as
a
result
japanesebrazilian
children
do
not
drop
out
a
common
problem
in
other
public
schools
where
foreign
children
are
often
bullied
because
of
the
growing
number
of
japanesebrazilian
students
some
japanese
parents
were
wary
of
letting
their
own
children
stay
at
the
school
school
officials
tried
to
persuade
the
japanese
to
keep
their
children
here
by
emphasizing
the
positive
side
effects
of
the
japanesebrazilian
presence
this
is
no
longer
the
era
of
a
homogeneous
people
but
rather
of
a
multiethnic
society
said
mitsuyuki
shibuya
a
school
official
the
new
era
may
be
symbolized
by
a
9yearold
japanesebrazilian
student
named
nicholas
wada
who
has
taken
home
prizes
for
poetry
and
other
subjects
which
his
parents
proudly
display
his
parents
joao

and
silvana
40
came
to
japan
18
years
ago
and
also
reared
a
daughter
veridiana
22
here
this
year
they
built
a
twostory
detached
house
as
a
sign
of
their
commitment
to
japan
my
son
has
no
image
at
all
of
brazil
so
we
built
this
house
for
him
wada
said
in

couples
living
room
nicholas
says
he
doesnt
want
to
go
to
brazil
he
thinks
in
japanese
wada
a
truck
driver
added
like
most
japanesebrazilians

indeed
like
almost
all
immigrants
throughout
the
world

the
wadas
arrived
here
intending
to
stay
only
two
or
three
years
even
if
you
ask
us
now
well
say
were
going
back
in
two
to
three
years
wada
said
uncertain
about
how
long
they
will
stay
in
japan
many
japanesebrazilians
send
their
children
to
private
portugueselanguage
schools
or
keep
them
out
of
school
altogether
going
to
school
is
not
compulsory
for
foreigners
of
the
nearly
33500
japanesebrazilian
children
in
japan
between
5
and
14
years
old
the
ages
of
compulsory
education
about
10000
are
in
japanese
schools
receiving
remedial
japanese
lessons
according
to
government
figures
most
of
the
rest
are
likely
in
portugueselanguage
schools
or
not
attending
school
children
who
do
not
attend
japanese
schools
tend
to
become
isolated
from
japanese
society
said
kiyoe

the
chairwoman
of
torcida
a
private
organization
that
teaches
japanese
to
japanesebrazilian
children
in
homi
even
if
they
intend
to
move
to
brazil
their
understanding
of
that
country
is
also
limited
one

studying
japanese
at
torcida
one
recent
morning
was
bruno
da

whose
japanese
maternal
grandparents
had
immigrated
to
brazil
with
his
parents
bruno
had
moved
to
japan
at
the
age
of
1
but
he
was
unable
to
express
himself
in
japanese
he
said
he
understood
most
of
his
favorite
cartoon
on
television
naruto
but
movies
were
beyond
his
comprehension
i
feel
brazilian
because
i
went
to
a
portuguese
school
bruno
said
if
id
gone
to
a
japanese
school
maybe
id
feel
differently
but
japan
is
also
my
country
i
grew
up
here
brazil
i
think
is
a
dangerous
country
i
mean
id
feel
afraid
to
carry
around

or
almost
a

force
here
in
the
past
year
the

made
changes

including
offering
the
foreign

longer

and
hiring
a
japanesebrazilian
chef
in
its
cafeteria

to
retain
japanesebrazilians
who
might
be

away

betterpaying

honest

work
more
faithfully
than

hiroaki

a

said
repeating
a
common
complaint
among
businesses
that
young
japanese
lacked
the
work
ethic
of
older
japanese
and
tended
to
quit
easily
kouji

the
manager
of
the
factory
said
simply
if
we
consider
the
future
we
just
wont
be
able
to
operate
this
factory
without
japanesebrazilians
tokai
rika
officials
did
not
venture
an
opinion
on
the
countrys
immigration
policies
but
some

homis
residents
did
hiroko
arakawa
52
a
japanese
homemaker
who
was
buying
meat
at
the
japanesebrazilian
supermarket
said
her
son
now
in
junior
high
school
had
had
japanesebrazilian
friends
since
elementary
school
and
she
had
enjoyed
getting
to
know
the
friends
parents
japan
should
open
itself
up
to
immigrants
and
give
them
full
access
to
society
she
said
they
become
sick
and
need
health
insurance
just
like
japanese
she
said
if
we
do
right
by
them
they
wont
want
to
leave
growing
up
in
st
louis
in
the
1950s
and
60s
deddrick
battle
came
to
believe
that
the
political
process
was
not
for
people
like
him

a
struggling
black
man
whose
vote
he
was
convinced
surely
would
not
count
for
much
of
anything
the
thought
became
ingrained
as
an
adult
almost
like
common
sense
and
that
partly
explains
why
at
age
55
he
just
registered
to
vote
for
the
first
time
a
month
ago
the
other
part
of
the
reason
is
sen
barack
obama
this
is
huge
battle
a
janitor
said
after
his
overnight
shift
cleaning
a
movie
theater
this
is
bigger
than
life
itself
when
i
was
coming
up
i
always
thought
they
put
in
who
they
wanted
to
put
in
i
didnt
think
my
vote
mattered
but
i
dont
think
that
anymore
across
the
country
black
men
and
women
like
battle
who
have
long
been
disaffected
apolitical
discouraged
or
just
plain
bored
with
politics
say
they
have
snapped
to
attention
this
year
according
to
dozens
of
interviews
conducted
in
the
last
several
days
in
six
states
they
are
people
like
25yearold
percy
matthews
of
chicagos
south
side
who
did
vote
once
but
whose
experience
was
so
forgettable
that
he
cannot
recall
with
certainty
for
whom
he
cast
a
ballot
or
even
what
year
it
was
now
an
enthusiastic
democrat
he
says
the
old
days
are
gone
and
shandell
wilcox
29
who
registered
to
vote
in
jacksonville
fla
when
she
was
18
then
proceeded
to
ignore
every
election
before
the
current
one
she
voted
for
the
first
time
wednesday
over
and
again
firsttime
and
relatively
new
voters
like
matthews
and
wilcox
far
past
the
legal
voting
age
said
they
were
inspired
by
the
singularity
of
the
2008
election
and
the
power
of
obamas
magnetism
many
also
said
they
were
loath
to
miss
out
on
their
part
in
writing
what
could
be
a
new
chapter
of
american
history

the
chance
to
vote
for
a
black
president
battle
for
one
remembers
growing
up
in
the
pruittigoe
housing
project
in
st
louis
and
how
intimidated
the
adults
were
about
voting
and
that
left
an
impression
on
him
the
older
women
he
knew
were
afraid
to
walk
to
the
polls
he
said
for
fear
of
being
attacked
i
didnt
think
it
was
for
black
people
period
he
said
of
politics
before
the
civil
rights
era
we
didnt
have
any
rights
really
we
were
just
coming
into
voting
and
everything
fastforwarding
to
the
present
he
continued
i
never
thought
that
id
see
this
day
i
never
thought
id
see
the
day
where
an
africanamerican
was
standing
at
the
podium
getting
ready
to
be
president
the
swelling
ranks
of
the
newly
enthusiastic
are
also
the
result
of
extensive
nationwide
voter
registration
drives
and
new
earlyvoting
procedures
in
many
states
which
have
made
the
process
easier
and
more
accessible
david
bositis
senior
political
analyst
at
the
joint
center
for
political
and
economic
studies
in
washington
said
the
states
with
the
largest
increases
in
early
voting
have
been
those
where
the
black
population
is
proportionally
the
highest
in
georgia
for
instance
blacks
represented
a
quarter
of
all
voters
in
the
2004
presidential
election
so
far
this
year
in
early
voting
alone
they
make
up
35
percent
of
all
voters
i
am
fully
expecting
record
black
turnout
bositis
said
its
not
just
a
question
of
obama
as
the
first
black
nominee
its
also
that
blacks
have
suffered
substantially
under
the
bush
years
and
blacks
have
been
the
single
most
antiiraqwar
group
in
the
population
he
added
obama
is
like
the
icing
on
the
cake
but
its
not
just
a
question
of
obama
one
early
voter
in
georgia
was
armento
meredith
43
who
waited
in
line
for
two
hours
at
the
fulton
county
government
building
in
downtown
atlanta
to
vote
for
the
first
time
thursday
its
time
for
a
change
meredith
a
telephone
operator
said
i
want
to
see
something
different
the
result
is
likely
to
be
a
level
of
black
participation
in
the
electoral
process
that
is
higher
than
ever
before
if
sustained
some
of
those
interviewed
said
it
might
also
translate
into
a
reinvigorated
spirit
of
democracy
in
some
communities
where
it
has
been
long
dormant
in
the
black
community
i
see
a
great
many
people
coming
out
who
were
apathetic
since
84
said
bob
law
63
an
activist
in
new
york
city
and
former
radio
host
who
worked
on
the
rev
jesse
jacksons
campaign
for
the
presidency
in
1984
the
first
time
a
black
candidate
was
a
serious
national
contender
but
in
the
years
since
he
said
blacks
enthusiasm
had
waned
people
didnt
vote
before
because
they
really
didnt
think
their
vote
was
going
to
make
a
difference
law
said
whenever
black
voters
felt
like
there
was
a
reason
to
vote
like
it
might
mean
something
theyve
turned
out
that
is
exactly
how
battle
the
janitor
in
st
louis
feels
in
the
past
i
felt
like
democrat
or
republican
it
didnt
matter
who
won
he
said
but
my
guy
obama
i
think
its
going
to
be
a
change
if
he
wins
hes
speaking
my
language
for
some
black
men
and
women
the
sense
of
pride
is
overwhelming
as
is
the
feeling
that
they
are
participating
in
what
could
become
a
touchstone
moment
something
that
children
and
grandchildren
will
want
to
hear
about
id
feel
bad
forever
if
i
didnt
get
out
this
time
said
wilcox
of
jacksonville
a
cafeteria
worker
id
feel
like
i
didnt
do
my
part
to
put
him
in
the
office
how
would
i
explain
that
to
my
little
girl
oh
i
had
something
better
to
do
and
sure
its
partially
because
hes
africanamerican
but
he
also
says
there
will
be
change
and
i
believe
him
timothy
hairston
47
a
bartender
in
brooklyn
ny
who
has
never
voted
before
shared
that
point
of
view
i
wanted
to
be
a
part
of
a
historical
moment
to
say
that
i
was
involved
in
history
in
the
making
that
i
was
an
active
participant
as
opposed
to
someone
on
the
sidelines
rooting
for
change
but
not
involved
in
the
process
of
making
change
he
added
of
obama
i
think
its
a
testament
to
his
campaign
that
he
can
inspire
at
the
end
of
the
day
no
matter
what
party
you
vote
for
i
think
every
once
in
a
while
there
are
inspirational
moments
that
call
for
people
to
wake
up
from
their
deep
sleep
and
become
alive
and
get
involved
and
i
think
barack
at
the
very
least
is
an
inspirational
figure
for
some
coming
back
to
political
life
was
a
slow
process
that
unfolded
over
months
others
said
they
were
struck
by
something
in
obamas
life
or
what
he
stands
for
and
conversion
was
immediate
wilcox
saw
some
of
her
own
biography
reflected
in
obamas
they
were
both
born
to
single
mothers
and
raised
mostly
by
their
grandparents
in
modest
settings
wilcox
said
she
felt
validated
motivated
and
inspired
all
at
once
when
she
first
heard
obamas
life
story
during
the
primary
season
i
began
to
think
that
we
had
a
lot
of
life
features
in
common
she
said
it
gave
me
hope
bianca
williams
20
a
hair
stylist
in
brooklyn
said
the
campaign
had
changed
her
life
after
seeing
obama
in
the
first
debate
she
decided
to
go
back
to
community
college
parttime
after
seeing
his
success
i
started
thinking
maybe
i
could
help
my
community
like
he
did
she
said
if
he
could
do
it
then
i
could
do
it
it
woke
me
up
careerwise
it
just
gave
me
the
willpower
to
go
on
that
is
also
true
for
matthews
who
works
in
a
chicago
coffee
shop
not
too
long
ago
he
said
he
lied
to
his
mother
about
having
voted
in
an
election
just
so
that
she
would
stop
nagging
him
to
get
out
and
vote
what
a
difference
this
year
has
made
he
said
he
watched
the
party
conventions
and
three
of
the
four
presidential
and
vice
presidential
debates
he
has
followed
coverage
of
the
candidates
in
the
local
papers
he
voted
in
the
primary
and
he

goose
bumps
he
said
for
18yearold
darnell
harris
of
cleveland
a
private
in
the
marines
the
legal
voting
age
could
not
come
fast
enough
im
excited
that
the
first
time
i
get
to
vote
its
for
barack
he
said
and
echoing
many
others
he
said
that
race
is
only
part
of
the
reason
obama
cares
about
everybody
whether
theyre
white
black
chinese
whatever
hes
not
just
for
one
little
group
for
some
new
voters
family
and
peer
pressure
certainly
played
a
role
most
of
my
life
i
didnt
want
to
get
involved
with
anything
political
said
damien
henderson
a
26yearold
merchant
seaman
but
everywhere
i
go
lately
people
are
talking
about
barack
obama
i
could
be
standing
in
line
at
a
grocery
and
somebodys
going
to
ask
me
what
i
think
about
barack
obama
henderson
said
he
started
paying
attention
and
fell
for
obamas
charisma
he
voted
for
the
first
time
monday
for
obama
how
did
it
feel
to
cast
that
first
vote
it
actually
felt
really
good
he
said
people
come
up
to
me
in
the
grocery
store
and
say
how
did
we
get
suckered
into
this
all
i
can
tell
them
is
we
thought
we
were
making
the
smart
choice

marc

an

school
board
member
in
kenosha
wis
on
a
snowy
day
two
years
ago
the
school
board
in
whitefish
bay
wis
gathered
to
discuss
a
looming
problem
how
to
plug
a
gaping
hole
in
the
teachers
retirement
plan
it
turned
to
david
w
noack
a
trusted
local
investment
banker
who
proposed
they
borrow
from
overseas
and
use
the
money
for
a
complex
investment
that
offered
big
profits
every
three
months
youre
going
to
get
a
payment
he
promised
according
to
a
tape
of
the
meeting
but
would
it
be
risky
there
would
need
to
be
15
enrons
for
the
district
to
lose
money
he
said
the
board
and
four
other
nearby
school
districts
ultimately
invested
200
million
in
noacks
deal
most
of
it
borrowed
from
an
irish
bank
without
realizing
it
the
schools
were
imitating
hedge
funds
across
the
country
new
york
subway
officials
were
also
being
wooed
by
bankers
officials
were
told
that
just
as
homebuyers
had
embraced
adjustablerate
loans
new
york
could
save
money
by
borrowing
at
lower
interest
rates
that
changed
every
day
for
some
of
the
deals
the
officials
were
encouraged
to
rely
on
the
same
irish
bank
as
the
wisconsin
schools
during
the
gogo
investing
years
school
districts
transit
agencies
and
other
government
entities
were
quick
to
jump
into
the
global
economy
hoping
for
fast
gains
to
cover
growing
pension
costs
and
budgets
without
raising
taxes
deals
were
arranged
by
armies
of
persuasive
financiers
who
received
big
paydays
but
now
hundreds
of
cities
and
government
agencies
are
facing
economic
turmoil
far
from
being
isolated
examples
the
wisconsin
schools
and
new
yorks
subway
system
are
among
the
many
players
in
a
financial
fiasco
that
has
ricocheted
globally
the
bank
at
the
center
of
their
saga
named
depfa
is
now
in
trouble
the
wisconsin
schools
are
on
the
brink
of
losing
their
money
confronting
educators
with
possible
budget
cuts
interest
rates
for
new
yorks
subways
are
skyrocketing
and
contributing
to
budget
woes
that
have
transportation
officials
considering
higher
fares
and
delaying
longplanned
track
repairs
and
the
banks
problems
have
threatened
the
stability
of
its
parent
company
in
munich
forcing
german
officials
to
intervene
with
a
multibilliondollar
bailout
to
stop
a
chain
reaction
that
could
freeze
germanys
economic
system
i
am
really
worried
said
becky
velvikis
a

teacher
at

elementary
in

wis
one
of
the
districts
that
invested
in
noacks

if
millions
of

are
gone
what
happens
to

or
the
construction
paper
and
pencils
and
supplies
we
need
to
teach
the
trail
through
wisconsin
new
york
and
europe
illustrates
how
this
financial
crisis
has
moved
around
the
world
so
fast
why
it
is
so
hard
to
tame
and
why
cities
schools
and
many
other
institutions
will
probably
struggle
for
years
the
local
papers
and
radio
shows
call
us
idiots
and
now
when
i
go
home
my
kids
ask
me
dad
did
you
do
something
wrong
said
shawn
yde
the
director
of
business
services
in
the
whitefish
bay
district
this
is
something
ill
regret
until
the
day
i
die
selling
risk
whitefish
bays
school
district
did
not
intend
to
become
a
hedge
fund
it
and
four
nearby
districts
were
just
trying
to
finance
retirement
obligations
that
were
growing
as
health
care
costs
rose
noack
the
local
representative
of
stifel
nicolaus
ampamp
co
a
st
louis
investment
bank
had
been
advising
wisconsin
school
boards
for
two
decades
helping
them
borrow
for
new
gymnasiums
and
classrooms
his
father
had
taught
at
an
area
high
school
for
47
years
all
six
of
his
children
attended
milwaukee
schools
noack
told
the
whitefish
bay
board
that
investing
in
the
global
economy
carried
few
risks
according
to
the
tape
whats
the
best
investment
its
called
a
collateralized
debt
obligation
or
a
cdo
noack
said
he
described
it
as
a
collection
of
bonds
from
105
of
the
most
reputable
companies
that
would
pay
the
school
board
a
small
return
every
quarter
were
being
very
conservative
noack
told
the
board
composed
of
lawyers
salesmen
and
a
homemaker
who
lived
in
the
affluent
milwaukee
suburb
soon
whitefish
bay
and
the
four
other
districts
borrowed
165
million
from
depfa
and
contributed
35
million
of
their
own
money
to
purchase
three
cdos
sold
by
the
royal
bank
of
canada
which
had
a
relationship
with
noacks
company
but
noacks
explanation
of
a
cdo
was
very
wrong
noack
who
through
his
lawyer
declined
to
comment
had
attended
only
a
twohour
training
session
on
cdos
he
told
a
friend
the
schools
200
million
was
actually
used
as
collateral
for
a
complicated
form
of
insurance
guaranteeing
about
20
billion
of
corporate
bonds
that
investment

known
as
a
synthetic
cdo

committed
the
boards
to
paying
off
other
bondholders
if
corporations
failed
to
honor
their
debts
if
just
6
percent
of
the
bonds
insured
went
bad
the
wisconsin
educators
could
lose
all
their
money
if
none
of
the
bonds
defaulted
the
schools
would
receive
about
18
million
a
year
after
paying
off
their
own
debt
by
comparison
the
cdos
offered
only
a
modestly
better
return
than
a
35
million
investment
in
ultrasafe
treasury
bonds
which
would
have
paid
about
15
million
a
year
with
virtually
no
risk
the
boards
as
part
of
their
deal
received
thick
packets
of
documents
ive
never
read
the
prospectus
said
marc
hujik
a
local
financial
adviser
and
a
member
of
the
kenosha
school
board
who
spent
13
years
on
wall
street
we
had
all
our
questions
answered
satisfactorily
by
dave
noack
so
i
wasnt
worried
wisconsin
schools
were
not
the
only
ones
to
jump
into
such
complicated
financial
products
more
than
12
trillion
of
cdos
have
been
sold
to
buyers
of
all
kinds
since
2005

including
many
cities
and
government
agencies

an
increase
of
270
percent
from
the
four
previous
years
combined
according
to
thomson
reuters
selling
these
products
to
municipalities
was
pretty
widespread
said
janet
tavakoli
a
finance
industry
consultant
in
chicago
they
tend
to
be
less
sophisticated
so
bankers
sell
them
products
stuffed
with
junk
from
the
wisconsin
deal
the
royal
bank
of
canada
received
promises
of
payments
totaling
about
112
million
according
to
documents
stifel
nicolaus
made
about
12
million
noacks
total
salary
was
about
300000
a
year
according
to
someone
with
knowledge
of
his
finances
and
depfa
received
interest
on
its
loans
in
separate
statements
the
royal
bank
of
canada
and
stifel
nicolaus
said
board
members
signed
documents
indicating
they
understood
the
investments
risks
both
companies
said
they
were
not
financial
advisers
to
the
boards
but
merely
sold
them
products
or
services
stifel
nicolaus
said
its
relationship
with
the
boards
ended
in
2007
noack
now
works
for
a
rival
firm
everyone
knew
new
york
guys
were
making
tons
of
money
on
these
kinds
of
deals
said
hujik
of
the
school
board
it
wasnt
implausible
that
we
could
make
money
too
a
bank
goes
global
by
the
time
depfa
financed
the
wisconsin
schools
investment
it
had
already
become
an
emblem
of
the
new
global
economy
it
was
founded
86
years
ago
as
a
sleepy
german
lender
and
for
most
of
its
history
had
focused
on
its
home
market
but
in
2002
a
new
chief
executive
gerhard
bruckermann
moved
depfa
to
the
freewheeling
financial
center
of
dublin
ireland
to
take
advantage
of
low
corporate
taxes
he
soon
pushed
the
company
into
sao
paulo
brazil
mumbai
india
warsaw
poland
hong
kong
dallas
new
york
tokyo
and
elsewhere
depfa
became
one
of
europes
most
profitable
banks
and
was
famous
for
lavish
events
and
large
paychecks
in
2006
top
executives
took
home
the
equivalent
of
33
million
at
current
exchange
rates
bruckermann
was
a
gregarious
leader
who
joked
that
he
hoped
to
make
all
employees
into
millionaires
he
divided
his
time
between
a
london
home
and
a
vast
farm
in
spain
where
he
grew
exotic
medicinal
plants
and
his
success
fueled
an
arrogance
former
colleagues
say
bruckermann
once
told
a
trade
publication
that
depfa
unlike
german
banks
understood
how
to
benefit
from
the
global
economy
with
our
efforts
we
are
like
the
oneeyed
man
who
becomes
king
in
the
land
of
the
blind
he
was
quoted
as
saying
bruckermann
who
left
the
bank
earlier
this
year
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
an
interview
but
as
depfa
grew
other
european
banks
began
competing
with
the
firm
so
executives
stretched
into
riskier
deals

the
sort
that
would
eventually
send
shockwaves
across
europe
and
the
united
states
some
of
bruckermanns
employees
grew
concerned
about
deals
like
one
struck
in
2005
with
the
metropolitan
transportation
authority
of
new
york
the
agency
overseeing
the
city
and
suburban
subways
buses
and
trains
for
years
municipal
agencies
like
the
metropolitan
transportation
authority
of
new
york
the
agency
overseeing
the
city
and
suburban
subways
buses
and
trains
had
raised
money
by
issuing
plainvanilla
bonds
with
fixed
interest
rates
but
then
bankers
began
telling
officials
that
there
was
a
way
to
get
cheaper
financing
bankers
said
that
cities
like
homebuyers
could
save
money
with
adjustablerate
loans
where
the
payments
started
low
and
changed
over
time
what
they
did
not
emphasize
was
that
such
payments
could
eventually
skyrocket
such
borrowing

known
as
variablerate
bonds

also
carried
big
fees
for
wall
street
the
pitches
were
very
successful
municipalities
issued
twice
as
many
variablerate
bonds
last
year
as
they
did
a
decade
earlier
but
variablerate
bonds
had
a
hitch
many
investors
would
purchase
them
only
if
a
bank
like
depfa
was
hired
as
a
buyer
of
last
resort
ready
to
acquire
bonds
from
investors
who
could
find
no
other
buyers
depfa
collected
fees
for
serving
that
role
but
expected
it
would
rarely
have
to
honor
such
pledges
depfas
salespeople
traveled
the
world
encouraging
officials
to
sign
up
for
variablerate
loans
and
bureaucrats
and
politicians
including
some
in
new
york
jumped
in
by
2006
depfa
was
the
largest
buyer
of
last
resort
in
the
world
standing
behind
29
billion
of
bonds
issued
that
year
alone
it
backed
a
200
million
bond
issued
by
the
mta
but
as
depfa
grew
it
became
more
reliant
on
enormous
shortterm
loans
to
finance
its
operations
those
loans
cost
less
and
thus
helped
the
bank
achieve
higher
profits
but
only
when
times
were
good
indeed
some
employees
were
worried
about
that
debt
in
2007
even
as
the
global
economy
was
softening
one
of
germanys
biggest
lenders
hypo
real
estate
purchased
depfa
for
78
billion
the
ceos
cut
was
more
than
150
million
he
then
left
the
company
to
grow
oranges
on
his
spanish
estate
the
investments
falter
last
march
the
delicate
web
tying
milwaukee
dublin
and
manhattan
became
an
anchor
dragging
everyone
down
yde
the
director
of
business
services
for
the
whitefish
bay
district
began
receiving
troubling
messages
indicating
the
districts
investments
were
declining
worried
he
started
coming
into
his
office
at
dawn
before
the
hallways
of
whitefish
bay
high
school
filled
with
students
as
the
sun
rose
yde
searched
for
explanations
by
the
light
of
his
computer
screen
he
googled
cdos
he
called
bankers
in
london
and
new
york
each
person
referred
him
to
someone
else
then
notices
arrived
saying
that
the
bonds
insured
by
whitefish
bays
cdos
were
defaulting
it
became
increasingly
likely
that
the
districts
money
would
be
seized
to
pay
off
other
bondholders
most
if
not
all
of
the
200
million
would
probably
be
lost
as
other
districts
received
similar
notices
panic
grew
for
some
boards
interest
payments
on
borrowed
money
were
now
larger
than
revenue
from
the
investments
officials
began
quietly
warning
that
they
might
have
to
dip
into
school
funds
this
is
going
to
have
a
tremendous
financial
impact
said
robert
f
kitchen
a
member
of
the
west
alliswest
milwaukee
school
board
officials
say
some
districts
may
have
to
cut
courses
like
art
and
drama
curtail
gym
and
classroom
maintenance
or
forgo
replacing
teachers
who
retire
problems
were
emerging
elsewhere
as
well
depfas
executives
were
realizing
that
bonds
all
over
the
world
were
declining
in
value
exposing
the
company
to
the
possibility
they
would
have
to
make
good
on
their
pledges
as
a
buyer
of
last
resort
and
depfa
was
still
borrowing
billions
each
month
to
cover
its
shortterm
loans
by
autumn
the
shortterm
debt
of
the
bank
and
its
parent
company
hypo
totaled
81
billion
then
in
midseptember
the
american
investment
bank
lehman
brothers
went
bankrupt
shortterm
lending
markets
froze
up
ratings
agencies
including
standard
ampamp
poors
downgraded
depfa
citing
the
companys
difficulties
borrowing
at
affordable
rates
that
set
off
a
crisis
in
germany
where
officials
worried
that
depfas
sudden
need
for
cash
would
drag
down
its
parent
company
and
set
off
a
chain
reaction
at
other
banks
the
german
government
and
private
banks
extended
64
billion
in
credit
to
hypo
to
stop
it
from
imploding
we
will
not
allow
the
distress
of
one
financial
institution
to
endanger
the
entire
system
angela
merkel
the
german
chancellor
said
at
the
time
that
crisis
spread
almost
immediately
to
the
mta
begin
optional
trim
the
transportation
authority
guided
by
gary
dellaverson
a
rumpled
cigarillosmoking
chief
financial
officer
had
375
billion
of
variablerate
debt
outstanding
about
200
million
of
that
debt
was
backed
by
depfa
when
the
bank
was
downgraded
investors
dumped
those
transportation
bonds
because
of
worries
they
would
get
stuck
with
them
if
depfas
problems
worsened
depfa
was
forced
to
buy
150
million
of
them
and
bonds
worth
billions
of
dollars
issued
by
other
municipalities
then
came
the
twist
depfas
contracts
said
that
if
it
bought
back
bonds
the
municipalities
had
to
pay
a
higherthanaverage
interest
rate
the
new
york
transportation
authoritys
repayment
obligation
could
eventually
balloon
by
about
12
million
a
year
on
the
depfa
loans
alone
on
its
own
that
cost
could
be
absorbed
by
the
agency
but
as
the
economy
declined
the
mta
had
lost
hundreds
of
millions
because
tax
receipts

which
finance
part
of
its
budget

were
falling
and
its
ability
to
renew
its
variablerate
bonds
at
low
interest
rates
was
hurt
by
the
trouble
at
depfa
and
other
banks
the
transportation
authority
now
faces
a
900
million
shortfall
according
to
officials
it
is
fairly
breathtaking
dellaverson
told
the
mtas
finance
committee
this
is
not
a
tolerable
longterm
position
for
us
to
be
in
in
a
recent
interview
dellaverson
defended
new
yorks
use
of
variable
bonds
variablerate
debt
has
helped
mta
save
millions
of
dollars
and
weve
been
conservative
in
issuing
it
he
said
but
there
are
risks
which
we
work
hard
to
mitigate
usually
it
works
but
whats
happening
today
is
a
total
lack
of
marketplace

a

tell
the

they

things
are
so
upbeat
in

that

can
feel

it

in

here
on

in

still
in

some
say
they
are
worried
about

about
how
a

in

we

40
years

as
a

ohalloran

ohalloran
said
and
i
dont
care
how
cold
it
is
or
how
long
i
have
to
wait
it
feels
too
historic
she
said
the
possibility
that
obama
would
be
elected
was
all
part
of
the
same
thing
she
was
fighting
for
in
the
1960s
my
reason
for
being
there
as
a
young
woman
was
because
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
see
this

it
is
a

interlude
here
at

on
the

border
where
this
summer
a
dispute
over
sovereignty
became
the
most
volatile
international
confrontation
in

in
20
years
cambodian
troops
occupy

is
in

is
most
easily
reached
from
the
high

the

who
claim
parts
of
the
territory
around
the
temple
are
mostly
out
of
sight
in
the
hills
or
in
camps
nearby
in

but
the
cambodian
government
seems
to
be
digging
in
for
a
long
siege
a
new
budget
expected
to
be
approved
in
the
coming
week
would
double
the

military
budget
to
500

our

more
organized
better

the

here
gen
chea

a
man
who
looks
to
be
in
his
50s
and
wore
a
white
tank
top
along
with
his
gold
wristwatch
and
held
a
dripping
red
dragon
fruit

claimed
a
great
victory
in
the
little
skirmish
that
took
place
oct
15
they
left
with
their
hands
in
the
air
he
said
of
a
group
of
10
thai
soldiers
whom
the
cambodians
captured
and
returned
he
raised
his
arms
and
shook
them
adding
they
were
trembling
they
thought
we
would
kill
them
other
tales
are
told
on
the
thai
side
and
the
origins
and
outcome
of
the
clash
remain
unclear
soldiers
here
say
that
three
cambodian
soldiers
died
two
by
gunfire
and
one
from
a
heart
attack
the
thais
admit
to
one
death

stone
staircase
that
rises
from

side

along
with

dragons
that
flank

but
nothing
seems
to
have
been
gained
or
lost
in
the
fighting
the
dispute
flared
in
july
when
unesco
the
cultural
agency
of
the
united
nations
declared
the
temple
a
world
heritage
site
based
on
a
cambodian
government
proposal
domestic
politics
in
thailand
fueled
a
nationalist
response
and
troops
artillery
and
tanks
were
moved
into
position
the
confrontation
echoes
with
the
history
of
the
rise
and
retreat
of
empires
over
the
centuries
and
old
fears
and
hatreds
still
burn
between
cambodia
and
its
more
powerful
neighbors
vietnam
and
thailand
the
dispute
also
draws
together
the
tangled
strands
of
more
recent
conflicts
with
roots
in
the
vietnam
war
and
the
brutal
decades
of
massacres
and
civil
war
involving
the
khmer
rouge
of
cambodia
one
chinesemade
85millimeter
artillery
piece
at
the
lip
of
the
precipice
was
brought
to
cambodia
by
invading
vietnamese
soldiers
in
1980
and
it
may
have
been
used
against
american
troops
a
few
years
before
that
since
then
both
khmer
rouge
and
government
soldiers
have
fired
it
as
control
of
preah
vihear
changed
hands
after
the
cambodian
civil
war
ended
a
decade
ago
the
khmer
rouge
were
integrated
into
the
government
army
and
the
combined
force
is
facing
off
now
against
thailand
the
thais
armed
and
equipped
mostly
with
american
weaponry
have
the
advantage
in
firepower
as
well
as
air
cover
from
fighter
jets
their
300000strong
military
is
three
times
the
size
of
the
cambodian
armed
forces
but
the
cambodians
with
their
more
tormented
history
are
more
hardened
soldiers
some
of
them
have
fought
on
one
side
or
another

or
on
more
than
one

since
they
were
boys
in
the
1960s
they
wanted
to
test
us
to
see
if
cambodian
troops
are
easy
to
intimidate

a

they

he
said
of
the
thai
soldiers
they
say
we
have
old
weapons
and
ask
us
if
they
really
fire
according
to
the
cambodian
soldiers
camped
here
the
oct

with

across

some
of

by

over

as
they
called
back

he

12yearold
joann
crow
thought
it
was
an

dad
couldnt
drive
us
to
school
because
it
was
so
hard
to
see
said
crow
now
72
he
had
to
walk
us
to
school
that
wednesday
with
a
flashlight
which
we
thought
was
fun
but
the
next
day
thursday
oct
28
her
grandmother
susan
gnora
62
started
coughing
and
experiencing
chest
pains
it
was
the
same
for
a
lot
of
older
residents
of
this
monongahela
river
valley
mill
town
24
miles
southeast
of
pittsburgh
she
died
the
next
day
thats
when
we
all
got
worried
said
crow
a
retired
child
care
worker
they
tried
to
blame
it
on
asthma
but
we
knew
that
wasnt
true
she
was
always
so
strong
it
was
that
smog
from
the
mills
by
the
time
a
rain
on
oct
31
cleared
the
air
20
people
in
donora
had
died
and
nearly
half
the
town
became
ill
in
one
of
the
worst
air
pollution
disasters
in
the
nations
history
after
decades
of
largely
remaining
silent
about
the
horrors
of
that
week
donora
residents
began
to
open
up
about
it
in
recent
years
placing
a
historical
marker
in
town
on
the
50th
anniversary
over
the
last
two
weeks
they
marked
the
60th
anniversary
with
memorials
for
the
families
of
those
who
died
discussions
with
experts
about
the
lessons
learned
and
the
opening
of
the
donora
smog
museum
with
the
slogan
clean
air
started
here
it
was
the
first
time
that
people
really
understood
that
a
lot
of
air
pollution
in
a
short
period
of
time
could
kill
people
said
dr
devra
davis
director
of
the
center
for
environmental
oncology
at
the
university
of
pittsburgh
and
author
of
when
smoke
ran
like
water
about
air
pollution
she
is
also
a
donora
native
who
was
2
at
the
time
of
the
smog
the
donora
smog
gained
national
attention
and
helped
lead
to
some
of
the
first
local
and
state
pollution
control
laws
and
eventually
the
1970
federal
clean
air
act
we
want
people
to
realize
donora
was
a
big
part
of
the
environmental
movement
said
don
pavelko
a
donora
councilman
who
came
up
with
the
idea
for
the
museum
the
smog
in
donora
over
the
years
had
been
looked
upon
as
a
black
eye
the
older
folks
just
didnt
want
to
talk
about
it
because
they
thought
it
was
bad
publicity
the
museum
in
a
former
chinese
restaurant
brings
together
photographs
old
newspapers
maps
and
copies
of
studies
of
the
smog

has
been
appointed
archivist
and
is
pursuing
oral
histories
of
that
week
paul
c
brown
81
who
worked
in
the
steel
mills
then
remembered
going
to
work
at
the
mill
that
saturday
we
all
thought
it
would
lift
eventually
because
we
were
used
to
the
fog
in
the
valley
he
said
then
i
started
to
hear
about
people
getting
sick
smog
was
not
unusual
in
donora
a
town
of
14000
then
that
was
home
to
the
american
steel
ampamp
wire
co
and
the
donora
zinc
works
plants

both
run
by
the
us
steel
co

that
sat
along
the
river
and
employed
5000
people
but
this
was
different
the
thick
yellowish
acrid
smog
was
the
result
of
an
unusual
weather
inversion

a
pocket
of
warm
stagnant
air

that
sat
over
the
valley
for
five
days
underneath
what
was
essentially
a
lid
on
the
valley
were
sulfuric
acid
nitrogen
dioxide
and
other
poisonous
gases
including
fluorine
that
would
normally
rise
into
the
atmosphere
most
researchers
blame
the
zinc
plant
which
had
long
been
a
source
of
complaints
and
was
responsible
for
the
denuding
of
almost
all
vegetation
within
a
halfmile
of
the
plant
the
actual
toll
from
the
smog
has
never
been
accurately
calculated
davis
said
donoras
mortality
rate
remained
high
for
years
afterwards
there
are
still
lessons
to
be
learned
davis
said
there
are
situations
like
donora
going
on
in
india
and
asia
right
now
the
plants
both
closed
by
1966
and
donora
is
now
a
struggling
town
of
5653
after
the
deadly
smog
us
steel
said
it
was
an
act
of
god
and
never
admitted
any
responsibility
even
after
it
settled
lawsuits
filed
against
it
for
250000
by
the
time
legal
fees
were
taken
out
and
the
money
was
spread
among
the
hundreds
of
victims

both
those
who
died
and
those
who
got
ill

my

said
she
had
enough
left

said
i
just

the
memory
of
it
helps
somebody
else

campaign
offered
on
two
of
the
three
big
cable
news
networks
fox
news
channel
and
msnbc
a
dual
reality
that
is
reflected
on
the
internet
as
well
on
one
polls
that
are
tightening
are
emphasized
over
those
that
are
not
and
the
rest
of
the
news
media
is
portrayed
as
papering
over
questions
about
obamas
past
associations
with
people
who
have
purportedly
antiamerican
tendencies
which
he
has
not
answered
i
feel
like
we
are
talking
to
the
germans
after
hitler
comes
to
power
saying
oh
well
i
didnt
know
ann
coulter
the
conservative
commentator
told
hannity
on
thursday
on
the
other
polls
that
show
tightening
are
largely
ignored
and
the
race
is
cast
as
one
between
an
angry
and
erratic
mccain
whose
desperate
misleading
campaign
has
as
low
as
a
4
percent
chance
of
beating
a
cool
confident
and
deserving
democratic
nominee
hes
been
a
good
father
a
good
citizen
hes
paid
attention
to
his
country
chris
matthews
the
msnbc
host
said
wednesday
night
in
addressing
those
who
might
be
leaning
against
obama
based
on
race
give
the
guy
a
break
and
think
about
voting
for
him
and
perhaps
unsurprisingly
each
campaign
is
often
at
war
against
its
television
antagonist
just
as
the
networks
are
at
war
with
each
other
it
is
a
political
division
of
news
that
harks
back
to
the
way
american
journalism
was
through
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
when
newspapers
had
more
open
political
affiliations
but
it
has
never
been
so
apparent
in
such
a
clearcut
way
on
television
a
result
of
market
forces
and
partisan
sensibilities
that
are
further
chipping
away
at
the
postwatergate
preeminence
of
a
more
dispassionate
approach
the
more
objective
approach
came
as
the
corporate
owners
of
the
networks
pushed
for
higher
profits
and
the
newspaper
industry
consolidated
and
sought
broader
audiences
to
sell
as
many
copies
as
you
could
to
as
many
people
as
you
could
you
became
what
we
considered
objective
said
richard
wald
a
professor
of
media
and
society
at
columbia
university
school
of
journalism
and
a
former
senior
vice
president
at
abc
news
fox
news
channel
was
founded
12
years
ago
with
an
argument
that
the
mainstream
news
media
were
biased
toward
liberals
and
that
nonliberals
were
starved
for
a
fair
and
balanced
television
antidote
by
day
and
openly
conservativeleaning
opinion
by
night
but
it
was
only
in
the
last
couple
of
years
that
msnbc
long
struggling
for
an
identity
and
lagging
established
itself
as
a
liberal
alternative
to
fox
news
channel
in
prime
time
finding
improved
ratings
in
the
mistrust
of
the
mainstream
media
that
had
grown
among
those
on
the
left
during
the
bush
years
and
the
iraq
war
the
presidential
campaign
and
the
partisan
and
ideological
intensity
surrounding
it
has
been
the
perfect
subject
for
both
sides
providing
endless
fodder
to
play
to
the
persuasions
of
their
audience
and
mock
the
views
expressed
on
the
rival
network
the
result
is
a
return
to
a
great
tradition
of
american
journalism
wald
said
basically
you
chose
your
news
outlet
if
it
made
you
happy
if
it
reinforced
all
your
views
indeed
voters
who
primarily
get
their
news
from
web
sites
like
the
huffington
post
by
day
and
msnbc
by
night
and
those
who
primarily
get
theirs
from
the
drudge
report
by
day
and
fox
news
channel
by
night
would
have
entirely
different
views
of
the
candidates
and
the
news
driving
the
campaign
year
at
second
place
in
the
ratings
behind
fox
news
channel
cnn
is
maintaining
a
far
more
traditional
approach
to
news
this
year
when
politicocom
reported
oct
21
that
the
republican
national
committee
had
spent
150000
on
clothing
for
gov
sarah
palin
of
alaska
olbermann
interrupted
his
8
pm
program
on
msnbc
to
promote
the
story
and
discuss
it
as
did
rachel
maddow
whose
program
follows
fox
news
channel
reported
it
first
the
next
morning
on
fox
ampamp
friends
in
a
segment
in
which
the
report
was
described
as
sexist
and
unfair
and
bill
oreilly
and
van
susteren
later
criticized
the
news
media
on
their
programs
for
giving
it
as
much
attention
as
they
had
it
was
ridiculous
oreilly
said
singling
out
the
new
york
times
in
particular
for
covering
the
purchase
that
was
a
role
reversal
from
may
2007
when
news
broke
that
former
sen
john
edwards
had
paid
400
for
a
haircut
out
of
his
democratic
presidential
campaign
account
olbermann
named
hannity
the
worst
person
in
the
world
a
running
feature
on
his
program
for
making
fun
of
edwards
haircut
and
showing
video
of
him
styling
his
hair
before
an
interview
oreilly
had
said
of
edwards
at
the
time
he
runs
around
telling
americans
the
system
is
rigged
while
paying
400
for
a
haircut
this
guy
is
a
oneman
sitcom
tom
rosenstiel
director
of
the
project
for
excellence
in
journalism
at
the
pew
research
center
said
to
some
extent
they
are
reverse
images
of
each
other
the
group
has
studied
the
tone
and
content
of
the
electionyear
coverage
and
found
that
mccain
has
been
the
subject
of
more
negative
reports
in
general
than
has
obama
on
issues
that
include
assessments
of
their
performances
in
polls
the
debates
and
running
their
campaigns
but
within
that
universe
the
study
found
the
number
of
positive
reports
on
mccain
at
fox
news
was
above
the
average
of
the
news
media
at
large
and
the
number
of
negative
reports
about
obama
was
higher
too
the
study
found
that
the
mix
of
positive
and
negative
was
roughly
equal
for
them
on
fox
and
the
study
found
that
msnbc
featured
more
negative
reports
about
mccain
than
the
rest
of
the
news
media
and
more
positive
reports
about
obama
cnn
was
more
generally
in
line
with
the
average
rosenstiel
said
fox
news
channel
and
msnbc
showed
ideological
differences
obviously
more
so
at
night
and
executives
at
those
networks
said
that
opinion
was
kept
to
their
primetime
lineups
and
away
from
their
news
reporting
officials
at
the
obama
and
mccain
campaigns
said
in
interviews
last
week
that
they
believed
they
were
treated
fairly
by
the
reporters
assigned
to
them
at
the
two
networks
including
major
garrett
and
carl
cameron
at
fox
news
channel
and
kelly
odonnell
and
lee
cowan
at

nbc
pools
some
political
newsgathering
efforts
with
the
new

times
and
advisers
to
both
campaigns
show
up
for
interviews
on
both
networks
obamas
campaign
aides
said
they
were
pleased
when
shepard
smith
the
fox
news
channel
anchor
this
week
dressed
down
joe
the
plumber
aka
samuel
j
wurzelbacher
for
agreeing
with
a
voter
who
called
a
vote
for
obama
a
vote
for
the
death
of
israel
reporting
that
obama
supported
israel
smith
added
with
exasperation
it
just
gets
frightening
sometimes
and
maddow
is
chilly
toward
obamas
position
that
he
would
attack
sites
inside
pakistan
without
permission
from
pakistans
government
if
there
were
an
opportunity
to
go
after
terrorists
but
officials
at
both
campaigns
also
said
there
had
been
plenty
of
instances
when
they
have
perceived
bias
in
regular
news
coverage
on
fox
news
channel
for
instance
greg
palkot
referring
to
obama
asked
a
guest
do
economists
say
that
in
fact
his
policies
could
drive
a
recession
into
a
depression
the
guest
donald
lambro
of
the
washington
times
responded
well
i
havent
read
that
no
raising
a
report
about
obama
campaign
suspicions
that
mccain
got
an
unfair
peek
at
questions
to
be
asked
of
him
at
a
joint
forum
at
the
saddleback
church
mccains
campaign
wrote
to
nbc
news
in
august
we
are
concerned
that
your
news
division
is
following
msnbcs
lead
in
abandoning
nonpartisan
coverage
of
the
presidential
race
and
sometimes
the
approaches
have
been
noticeable
simply
through
what
the
networks
cover
after
npr
reported
late
last
week
that
a
mccain
supporter
former
secretary
of
state
lawrence
eagleburger
questioned
whether
palin
was
prepared
to
take
the
reins
of
the
presidency
msnbc
mentioned
it
roughly
20
times
over
the
course
of
the
day
cnn
mentioned
it
four
times
and
fox
news
channel
did
one
segment
in
which
it
interviewed
eagleburger
who
apologized
and
said
palin
was
a
quick
study
fox
news
channel
executives
would
not
comment
for
this
article
phil
griffin
president
of
msnbc
agreed
that
at

his

gives
a
decidedly
opinionated
viewpoint
all
of
our
material
is
based
on
fact

our
guys
work
really
hard
on
it
and
the
pointofview
shows
make
their
conclusions
griffin
said
in
this
modern

youve
got
a
variety
of
places
that
look
at

some
you
respect
more

others
others
you
recognize
as
having
a
point
of

some
you
see
as
factual
in
a

way

it
all
blends
together
into
how
you
make
your
decision
for
whats
going
on
the

of
testimony
about
a

stuffed
with

campaign
contributions
bound
for
buenos
aires
a
federal
jury
here
remains
undecided
about
the
role
of
a
venezuelan
businessman
the
businessman
franklin
duran
is
charged
with
conspiracy
and
with
operating
in
the
united
states
as
an
unauthorized
agent
of
a
foreign
government
prosecutors
say
duran
who
owns
a
house
in
the
miami
area
came
to
the
united
states
at
the
behest
of
the
venezuelan
government
to
coerce
a
friend
to
conceal
the
source
and
destination
of
an
800000
cash
contribution
to
the

campaign
of

cristina
fernandez
de
kirchner
who
went

jurors
have
deliberated
for

remain
deadlocked
earlier
this
week
they
sent

lenard
instructed
them
to
continue
deliberating
both
kirchner
and
her
venezuelan
counterpart
president
hugo
chavez
have
denied
any
role
in
the
matter
which
has
made
headlines
in
latin
america
the
jurys
impasse
has
prompted
some
venezuelans
to
speculate
in
news
blogs
and
internet
chat
rooms
that
the
chavez
administration
is
somehow
manipulating
the
jury
to
prevent
a
guilty
verdict
if
he
is
found
guilty
those
that
are
antichavez
will
be
happy
said
laura
weffer
an
investigative
reporter
for
the
leading
venezuelan
newspaper
el
nacional
who
has
covered
the
duran
trial
from
its
inception
in
september
but
if
there
is
a
mistrial
they
will
say
he
bought
the
jurors
among
those
testifying
at
the
trial
was
maria
lujan
telpuk
the
former
argentine
police
officer
who
discovered
the
moneyladen
suitcase
in
the
airport
in
buenos
aires
and
later
capitalized
on
her
fame
by
posing
naked
for
the
latin
american
edition
of
playboy
magazine
during
the
trial
prosecutors
also
played
secretly
recorded
phone
conversations
between
duran
and
others
among
the
conservations
recorded
by
the
fbi
were
those
between
duran
and
his
friend
guido
alejandro
antonini
wilson
who
was
carrying
the
suitcase
filled
with
800000
in
50
bills
when
he
was
stopped
aug
4
2007
stripped
of
the
money
wilson
returned
to
south
florida
where
he
has
a
home
and
approached
the
fbi
to
become
a
witness
for
the
agency
wilson
was
paid
30000
by
the
bureau
for
his
services
according
to
testimony
at
the
trial
durans
lawyers
contend
that
he
became
involved
in
the
case
to
help
wilson
and
not
at
the
behest
of
chavez
or
venezuelan
intelligence
everything
franklin
duran
did
he
did
for
himself
and
for
his
best
friend
in
the

alejandro

ed
shohat
durans
lawyer
said
in
his
closing
remarks
last
week
just
because
the
venezuelan
government
wants
the
same
thing
he
added
doesnt
mean
franklin
duran
is
working
as
an
agent
of
the
venezuelan
government
shohat
had
said
us
prosecutors
pursued
the
case
to
try
to
embarrass

men
have
pleaded
guilty
to
their
roles
in
trying
to
cover
up
the
affair
two
of
the
men
testified
on
behalf
of
the
prosecution
deliberations
could
continue
until
late
next
week
a
defense
lawyer
said
as
the
jurors
will
convene
for
an
abbreviated
session
on
monday
and
be
pardoned
from
court
altogether
tuesday
because
two
jurors
have
a
conflict
that
day
many
of
the
mug
shots
of
drug
traffickers
that
appear
in
the
mexican
press
show
surly
looking
roughnecks
glaring
menacingly
at
the
camera
an
anticorruption
investigation
unveiled
last
week
in
the
mexican
capital
however
made
it
clear
that
not
everybody
enmeshed
in
the
narcotics
trade
looked
the
part
there
was
a
grayhaired
grandfatherly
type
who
was
pushing
70
as
well
as
an
avuncular
figure
with
a
neatly
styled
goatee
and
wirerimmed
spectacles
perched
upon
his
nose
some
of
the
five
men
who
found
themselves
on
the
front
pages
of
newspapers
on
their
way
to
jail
wore
suits
which
made
them
look
more
like
bureaucrats
than
bad
guys
among
the
greatest
challenges
in
mexicos
drug
war
is
the
fact
that
the
traffickers
fit
no
type
their
ranks
include
men
and
women
the
young
and
the
old
and
they
can
work
anywhere
in
remote
drug
labs
as
part
of
roving
assassination
squads
even
within
the
upper
reaches
of
the
government
it
has
long
been
known
that
drug
gangs
have
infiltrated
local
police
forces
now
it
is
becoming
ever
more
clear
that
the
problem
does
not
stop
there
the
alarming
reality
is
that
many
public
servants
in
mexico
are
serving
both
the
taxpayers
and
the
traffickers
the
men
in
suits
it
turns
out
were
both
bureaucrats
and
bad
guys
corrupt
officials
high
up
in
an
elite
unit
of
the
federal
attorney
generals
office
who
were
feeding
secret
information
to
the
feared
beltran
leyva
cartel
in
exchange
for
suitcases
full
of
cash
their
arrest
and
the
firing
of
35
other
suspect
lawenforcement
officials
represents
the
most
extensive
corruption
case
that
this
country
which
knows
corruption
all
too
well
has
ever
seen
and
it
raises
a
question
that
is
on
the
lips
of
many
mexicans
how
does
one
know
who
is
dirty
and
who
is
clean
im
convinced
that
to
stop
the
crime
we
first
have
to
get
it
out
of
our
own
house
president
felipe
calderon
who
has
made
fighting
trafficking
a
crucial
part
of
his
presidency
said
in
a
speech
tuesday
after
the
arrests
were
announced
that
house
is
clearly
dirty
there
is
ample
evidence
that
mexicans
of
all
walks
of
life
are
willing
to
join
the
drug
gangs
in
exchange
for
cash
including
the
farmers
who
abandon
traditional
crops
and
turn
to
growing
marijuana
and
the
accountants
who
hide
the
narcotraffickers
profits
there
was
sporadic
evidence
in
the
past
that
such
corruption
extended
into
highlevel
government
offices
an
army
general
who
commanded
mexicos
antidrug
unit
was
arrested
and
convicted
in
1997
after
the
discovery
that
he
was
working
for
a
drug
lord
on
the
side
in
2005
a
spy
working
for
a
drug
cartel
was
discovered
working
in
the
presidents
office
and
accused
of
feeding
traffickers
information
on
the
movements
of
vicente
fox
then
the
president
but
the
abundance
of
law
enforcement
officials
now
believed
to
be
on
the
take
has
made
calderons
drug
war
all
the
more
difficult
to
execute
traffickers
often
know
beforehand
when
raids
are
going
to
occur
sometimes
dealers
plant
their
people
on
the
teams
that
carry
out
the
raids
to
act
as
saboteurs
the
traffickers
networks
are
not
foolproof
calderons
government
did
manage
to
capture
alfredo
beltran
leyva
a
cartel
leader
in
january
even
though
the
group
was
receiving
inside
information
what
appears
to
have
happened
officials
say
is
that
the
army
carried
out
the
raid
without
involving
the
attorney
generals
office
inadvertently
keeping
the
corrupt
officials
out
of
the
loop
the
cartels
leaders
who
operate
out
of
sinaloa
state
and
have
been
implicated
in
the
killing
of
a
top
police
commander
in
mexico
city
were
described
in
local
press
accounts
as
being
furious
that
their
government
moles
had
not
informed
them
of
the
raid
still
the
reach
of
the
drug
networks
is
so
extensive
that
even
winning
a
court
conviction
against
a
kingpin
is
not
always
enough
to
claim
victory
many
prison
wardens
and
guards
have
shown
themselves
to
be
corrupt
allowing
prominent
detainees
not
only
to
operate
their
crime
networks
from
their
cells
but
also
to
use
their
illicit
drug
proceeds
to
be
as
comfortable
as
possible
behind
bars
paying
for
everything
from
pizza
to
prostitutes
the
cartel
leaders
sometimes
even
use
their
money
to
escape
the
most
notorious
case
was
in
2001
when
joaquin
guzman
loera
the
countrys
most
wanted
drug
lord
managed
to
slip
out
of
a
maximum
security
prison
in
a
laundry
cart
the
porous
nature
of
mexican
penitentiaries
has
prompted
calderon
to
increase
the
number
of
transfers
of
drug
lords
to
the
us
prison
system
the
united
states
has
already
filed
the
paperwork
to
extradite
one
of
the
officials
accused
last
week
of
corruption
the
official
miguel
colorado
gonzalez
68
was
a
top
manager
in
the
government
organizedcrime
office
known
by
the
spanish
acronym
siedo
calderon
is
not
the
first
president
to
try
to
root
out
corruption
president
ernesto
zedillo
reorganized
the
nations
federal
police
at
least
twice
each
time
traffickers
quickly
infiltrated
the
force
and
bought
off
leading
officials
his
successor
fox
tried
and
failed
to
clean
up
law
enforcement
as
well
calderons
efforts
have
been
sustained
enough
that
the
traffickers
have
begun
a
vicious
counterattack
so
far
this
year
nearly
4000
people

including
police
officers
soldiers
criminals
and
civilians

have
been
killed
in
an
extraordinary
wave
of
violence
linked
to
organized
crime
the
latest
corruption
scandal
has
prompted
calderons
attorney
general
to
order
a
restructuring
and
purging
of
his
office
and
specifically
of
siedo
which
was
formed
from
another
agency
that
was
shut
down
after
being
infiltrated
by
drug
spies
the
government
has
ordered
more
liedetector
tests
for
officials
in
delicate
posts
beefedup
background
checks
and
better
salaries
for
underpaid
police
officers
but
the
amount
of
cash
that
the
traffickers
throw
around

which
jorge
chabat
a
security
analyst
calls
enough
money
to
buy
part
of
the
state

makes
government
salaries
seem
laughable
clearly
the
government
cannot
compete
peso
for
peso
in
some
cases
finding
out
who
has
strayed
from
the
straight
and
narrow
should
be
a
simple
matter
of
following
the
money
colorado
gonzalez
is
reported
to
have
bought
four
luxury
vehicles
in
one
year
expensive
jewelry
was
found
in
his
home
his
bank
account
was
bulging
in
tuesdays
speech
a
clearly
frustrated
calderon
said
the
fight
to
clean
up
mexico
depended
on
citizens
putting
their
country
first
and
respecting
the
law
above
all
else
he
suggested
that
the
small
bribes
so
often
demanded
by
the
officer
on
the
beat
and
accepted
by
the
public
as
normal
for
infractions
real
and
imagined
were
not
disconnected
from
the
government
official
receiving
millions
of
dollars
in
drug
profits
we
need
a
stronger
society
a
society
that
lives
the
principle
of
legality
with
conviction
that
encourages
promotes
spreads
and
educates
its
children
with
values
calderon
said
in
other
words
there
has
to
be
a
line
people
will
not
cross
even
for
a
suitcase
full
of
cash
and
so
just
how
far
have
we
come
as
a
rough
gauge
last
week
i
watched
a
movie
i
hadnt
seen
since
it
came
out
when
i
was
a
teenager
in
1967
back
then
guess
whos
coming
to
dinner
was
hollywoods
idea
of
a
stirring
call
for
racial
justice
the
premise
a
young
white
woman
falls
madly
in
love
with
a
black
man
while
visiting
the
university
of
hawaii
and
brings
him
home
to
san
francisco
to
get
her
parents
blessing
dad
a
crusading
newspaper
publisher
and
mom
a
modern
art
dealer
are
wealthy
white
liberals

katharine
hepburn
and
spencer
tracy
no
less

so
surely
there
can
be
no
problem
complications
ensue
before
everyone
does
the
right
thing
though
the
film
was
a
boxoffice
smash
and
received
10
oscar
nominations
even
four
decades
ago
it
was
widely
ridiculed
as
dated
by
liberal
critics
the
hero
played
by
the
first
black
hollywood
superstar
sidney
poitier
was
seen
as
too
perfect
and
too
white

an
impossibly
handsome
doctor
with
johns
hopkins
and
yale
on
his
resume
and
a
nobelworthy
career
fighting
tropical
diseases
in
africa
for
the
world
health
organization
what
couple
would
not
want
him
as
a
soninlaw
hes
so
calm
and
sure
of
everything
says
his
fiancee
he
doesnt
have
any
tensions
in
him
she
is
confident
that
every
single
one
of
their
biracial
children
will
grow
up
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
and
theyll
all
have
colorful
administrations
what
a
strange
movie
to
confront
in
2008
as
the
world
knows
barack
obamas
own
white
mother
and
african
father
met
at
the
university
of
hawaii
in
dreams
from
my
father
he
even
imagines
the
awkward
dinner
where
his
mother
introduced
her
liberalish
parents
to
her
intended
in
1959
but
whats
most
startling
about
this
archaic
film
is
the
sole
element
in
it
that
proves
inadvertently
contemporary
faced
with
a
black
man
in
the
mold
of
the
poitier
character

one
who
appears
so
calm
and
without
tensions

white
liberals
can
make
utter
fools
of
themselves
when
joe
biden
spoke
of
obama
being
clean
and
articulate
he
might
have
been
recycling
spencer
tracys
lines
of
41
years
ago
bidens
gaffe
though
particularly
naked
prefigured
a
larger
pattern
in
the
extraordinary
election
campaign
that
has
brought
an
africanamerican
to
the
brink
of
the
presidency
our
political
and
news
media
establishments

fixated
for
months
on
tracking
down
every
unreconstructed
bigot
in
bluecollar
america

have
their
own
conspicuous
racial
myopia
with
its
own
set
of
stereotypes
and
cliches
they
consistently
underestimated
obamas
candidacy
because
they
often
saw
him
as
a
standin
for
the
twodimensional
character
poitier
had
to
shoulder
in
guess
whos
coming
to
dinner
its
why
so
many
got
this
election
wrong
so
often
there
were
countless
ruminations
in
print
and
on
television
asking
the
same
two
rhetorical
questions
is
he
black
enough
and
is
he
tough
enough
the
implied
answer
to
both
was
usually
no
the
brownskinned
child
of
biracial
parents
wasnt
really
black
and
wouldnt
appeal
to
black
voters
who
were
overwhelmingly
loyal
to
the
wife
of
americas
first
black
president
and
as
a
former
constitutional
law
professor
obama
was
undoubtedly
too
lofty
an
intellectual
to
be
a
political
street
fighter
too
much
of
a
wuss
to
land
a
punch
in
a
debate
too
ethereal
to
connect
to
real
americans
he
was
adlai
stevenson
michael
dukakis
or
bill
bradley
in
dark
face

no
populist
pugilist
like
john
edwards
the
list
of
mistaken
prognostications
that
grew
from
these
flawed
premises
is
long
as
primary
season
began
we
were
repeatedly
told
that
hillary
clintons
campaign
was
the
most
battletested
and
disciplined
with
an
invincible
organization
and
an
unbeatable
donors
network
poor
obama
had
to
settle
for
the
ineffectual
passion
of
the
starryeyed
internetfixated
college
kids
who
failed
to
elect
howard
dean
in
2004
when
clinton
lost
in
iowa
no
matter
obama
could
never
breach
the
firewalls
that
would
wrap
up
her
nomination
by
super
tuesday
neither
the
clinton
campaign
nor
the
many
who
bought
its
spin
noticed
the
takenoprisoners
political
insurgency
that
obama
had
built
throughout
the
caucus
states
and
that
serves
him
to
this
day
once
obama
wrested
the
nomination
from
clinton
by
surpassing
her
in
organization
cash
and
black
votes
he
was
still
often
seen
as
too
wimpy
to
take
on
the
republicans
this
prognosis
was
codified
by
karl
rove
whose
punditry
for
the
wall
street
journal
and
newsweek
has
been
second
only
to
jon
stewart
and
stephen
colbert
as
a
reliable
source
of
laughs
this
year
rove
called
obama
lazy
and
over
the
summer
he
predicted
that
his
fundraising
had
peaked
in
february
and
that
hed
have
a
serious
problem
winning
over
hispanics
well
obama
was
lazy
like
a
fox
and
is
leading
john
mccain
among
hispanics
by
2
to
1
obama
has
also
pulled
ahead
among
white
women
despite
the
widespread
predictions
that
hed
never
bring
furious
hillary
supporters
into
the
fold
but
certainly
the
single
most
revelatory
moment
of
the
campaign

about
the
political
establishment
not
obama

arrived
in
june
when
he
reversed
his
position
on
taking
public
financing
this
was
a
huge
flipflop
if
no
bigger
than
mccains
on
the
bush
tax
cuts
but
the
reaction
was
priceless
suddenly
the
political
world
discovered
that
far
from
being
some
exotic
hothouse
flower
obama
was
a
pol
from
chicago
up
until
then
it
rarely
occurred
to
anyone
that
he
had
to
be
a
ruthless
competitor
not
merely
a
sweettalking
orator
to
reach
the
top
of
a
political
machine
even
rougher
than
the
clinton
machine
he
had
brought
down
whether
that
makes
him
more
black
or
more
white
remains
unresolved
early
in
the
campaign
the
black
commentator
tavis
smiley
took
a
lot
of
heat
when
he
questioned
all
the
rhetoric
much
of
it
from
white
liberals
about
obama
being
postracial
smiley
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
such
thing
in
america
as
race
transcendence
he
is
right
of
course
america
can
no
sooner
disown
its
racial
legacy
starting
with
the
original
sin
of
slavery
than
it
can
disown
its
flag
its
built
into
our
dna
obama
acknowledged
as
much
in
his
landmark
speech
on
race
in
philadelphia
in
march
yet
much
has
changed
for
the
better
since
the
era
of
guess
whos
coming
to
dinner
thanks
to
the
epic
battles
of
the
civilrights
movement
that
have
made
the
obama
phenomenon
possible
as
mark
harris
reminds
us
in
his
recent
book
about
late1960s
hollywood
pictures
at
a
revolution
it
was
not
until
the
year
of
the
movies
release
that
the
warren
court
handed
down
the
loving
decision
overturning
laws
that
forbade
interracial
marriage
in
16
states
in
the
films
final
cut
theres
still
an
outdated
line
referring
to
the
possibility
that
the
young
couples
nuptials
could
be
illegal
as
obamas
parents
marriage
would
have
been
in
say
virginia
in
that
same
year
of
1967
lbjs
secretary
of
state
dean
rusk
offered
his
resignation
when
his
daughter
a
stanford
student
announced
her
engagement
to
a
black
georgetown
grad
working
at
nasa
johnson
didnt
accept
it
obamas
message
and
genealogy
alike
embody
what
has
changed
in
the
decades
since
when
he
speaks
of
red
and
blue
america
being
seamlessly
woven
into
the
united
states
of
america
it
is
always
shorthand
for
the
reconciliation
of
black
and
white
and
brown
and
yellow
america
as
well
demographically
thats
where
america
is
heading
in
the
new
century
and
that
will
be
its
destiny
no
matter
who
wins
the
election
this
year
still
the
country
isnt
there
yet
and
should
obama
be
elected
america
will
not
be
cleansed
of
its
racial
history
or
conflicts
it
will
still
have
a
virtually
allwhite
party
as
one
of
its
two
most
powerful
political
organizations
there
will
still
be
white
liberals
who
look
at
obama
and
cant
quite
figure
out
what
to
make
of
his
complex
mixture
of
idealism
and
hardknuckled
political
cunning
of
his
twin
identities
of
international
sojourner
and
conventional
middleclass
overachiever
after
some
20
months
were
all
still
getting
used
to
obama
and
still
for
that
matter
trying
to
read
his
sometimes
ambiguous
takes
on
both
economic
and
foreign
affairs
what
we
have
learned
definitively
about
him
so
far

and
what
may
most
account
for
his
victory
should
he
achieve
it

is
that
he
had
both
the
brains
and
the
muscle
to
outsmart
outmaneuver
and
outlast
some
of
the
smartest
people
in
the
country
starting
with
the
clintons
we
know
that
he
ran
a
brilliant
campaign
that
remained
sane
and
kept
to
its
initial
plan
even
when
his
republican
opponent
and
his
own
allies
were
panicking
all
around
him
we

he

county
republican

chairman
since
1999
and
with
his
encyclopedic
knowledge
of
the
neighborhoods
and
demographics
of

he
built
the
grassroots
effort
that
pushed
george

bush
to
victory
here
and
statewide
in
2000
and
2004
but
this
year
oliver
said
the
challenge
is
tougher
part
of
it
is
the
collapse
of
the
economy
of
the
western
world
he
said
part
is
the
competition
a
campaign
by
sen
barack
obama
that
has
poured
more
money
and
people
into
the
state
than
sen
john
mccain
has
even
the
most
seasoned
republicans
now
acknowledge
that
they
face
an
uphill
fight
this
is
as
difficult
an
environment
for

as
theres
been
since
watergate
said
george

manager

charlie
crist
a
republican
oliver
agrees
and
like
many
republicans
trying
in
the
final
days
to
push
their
party
to
victory
he
says
he
has
found
inspiration
in
mccain
the
perseverant
prisoner
of
war
who
came
from
behind
to
seize
the
republican
nomination
the
current
call
to
arms
is
simple
if
anyone
can
pull
it
off
its
john
mccain
as
serious
as
icelands
economic
situation
already
was
britain

their
old
friend
nato
ally
and
trading
partner

made
it
immeasurably
worse
in
the
view
of
icelands
government
its
citizens
and
even
some
outsiders
the
troubles
between
the
countries
began
three
weeks
ago
when
britain
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
using
its
2001
antiterrorism
laws
to
freeze
the
british
assets
of
a
failing
icelandic
bank
that
appeared
to
brand
iceland
a
terrorist
state
i
must
admit
that
i
was
absolutely
appalled
the
icelandic
foreign
minister
ingibjorg
solrun
gisladottir
said
in
an
interview
describing
her
horror
at
opening
the
british
treasury
departments
home
page
at
the
time
and
finding
iceland
on
a
list
of
terrorist
entities
with
alqaida
sudan
and
north
korea
among
others
the
immediate
effect
was
to
trigger
an
almost
complete
freeze
on
any
banking
transactions
between
iceland
and
abroad
said
jon
danielsson

economist
at
the
london
school
of

when
youre
labeled
a
terrorist
nobody
does

with
you
the
icelandic
prime
minister
geir
h
haarde
accused
britain
of
bullying
a
small
neighbor
and
said
the
action
was
very
out
of
proportion
and
an
online
petition
signed
so
far
by
more
than
20
percent
of
icelands
population
said
the
british
prime
minister
gordon
brown
had
sacrificed
iceland
for
his
own
shortterm
political
gain
thereby
turning
a
grave
situation
into
a
national
disaster
icelands
financial
problems
had
been
brewing
for
some

past
spring
the
countrys

bloated
with
foreign
deposits

debts
began
to
falter
this
fall
as
the
financial
crisis
deepened
the

of

banks
the
british
government
alarmed
about
the
tens
of
thousands
of
accounts
held
by

on

icelands
ambassador
to
britain
sverrir
h
gunnlaugsson
said
in
an
interview
that
this
statement
was
particularly
damaging
on
a
rainy
friday
evening
in
early
august
six
taliban
fighters
attacked
a
police
post
in
a
village
in
buner
a
quiet
farming
valley
just
outside
pakistans
lawless
tribal
region
the
militants
tied
up
eight
policemen
and
lay
them
on
the
floor
and
according
to
local
accounts
the
youngest
member
of
the
gang
a
14yearold
shot
the
captives
on
orders
from
his
boss
the
fighters
stole
uniforms
and
weapons
and
fled
into
the
mountains
almost
instantly
the
people
of
buner
armed
with
rifles
daggers
and
pistols
formed
a
posse
and
after
five
days
they
cornered
and
killed
their
quarry
a
video
made
on
a
cell
phone
showed
the
six
militants
lying
in
the
dirt
blood
oozing
from
their
wounds
the
stand
at
buner
has
entered
the
lore
of
pakistans
war
against
the
militants
as
a
dramatic
example
of
ordinary
citizens
determination
to
draw
a
line
against
the
militants
but
it
says
as
much
about
the
shortcomings
of
pakistans
increasingly
overwhelmed
police
forces
and
the
pellmell
nature
of
the
efforts
to
stop
the
militants
who
week
by
week
seem
to
seep
deeper
into
pakistan
from
their
tribal
strongholds

the
events
in
buner
the
inspector
general

police
in

northwest
frontier
province
malik
naveed
khan
has
encouraged
citizens
in
other
towns
and
villages
in
his
realm
to
form

their
own

is
that
determination
itself
will
deter
taliban
encroachment
building
on
the
august
victory
with
one
phalanx
after
another
of
committed
citizens

the
strategy
is
also
a
sign
of
his
desperation

to
lower

standards

the

is

said
he
was
confident
of
victory
in
every
state
the
democrats
won
in

and
that
changing
demographic
is
one
reason
sen

holds
a
narrow

in

here
as
both

battle
for
the

obama
the
democratic
presidential
nominee
and
gov

the
republican
vicepresidential

here
in

reminders
of

dueling

in

a

presidential
candidate
has
not

but
the

the

my

wilder
a

sees
a

the

campaign
may
be
down
in
some
polls
by
doubledigit
margins
in
pennsylvania
which
has
not
voted
republican
in
a
presidential
race
since
1988
yet
the
campaign
knows
it
must
take
the
state
if
it
wants
to
win
the
white
house
and
it
is
taking
a
page
from
sen

rodham
clintons
playbook
to
try
to
do
so
to
that
end
sen
john
mccain
has
poured
20
million
in
advertisement
purchases
here
more
than
any
other
state
by
a
long
shot
still
he
is
swamped
by
obama
who
has
spent
34
million
here
the
candidate
has
come
to
the
state
more
than
16
times
since
early
june
and
his
running
mate
gov
sarah
palin
continues
to
stump
here
in
the
campaigns
waning
days
even
joe
the
plumber
campaigned
for
mccain
at
a
popular
south
philadelphia
cheese
steak
haunt
last
week
but
to
go
to
sen
barack
obamas
headquarters
in
center
city
is
to
see
what
mccain
is
up
against
the
office
is
jammed
with
more
than
50
volunteers
on
computers
and
on
the
phones
preparing
for
an
orchestrated
getoutthe
vote
drive
even
a
television
crew
from
indonesia
was
there
to
film
it
adding
to
a
palpable
sense
of
excitement
by
contrast
at
a
nearby
mccainpalin
office
there
was
not
a
single
volunteer
a
reflection
how
mccain
is
concentrating
on
drawing
votes
in
more
rural
areas
of
pennsylvania
still
the
state
has
long
posed
a
challenge
to
obama
and
the
time
and
money
spent
by
the
mccain
campaign
has
put
obama
on
the
defensive
clinton
won
by
a
comfortable
margin
here
in
the
democratic
primary
and
took
more
than
70
percent
of
the
votes
in
some
of
the
conservative
western
counties
all
this
has
given
the
mccain
campaign
hope
that
it
might
have
a
chance
in
this
reliably
democratic
state
as
other
republican
strongholds
slip
away
the
key
to
a
mccain
victory
is
threefold
to
highlight
his
maverick
image
among
moderate
swing
voters
in
the
philadelphia
suburbs
to
hold
onto
republican
strongholds
in
the
southcentral
part
of
the
state
which
are
mostly
white
and
conservative
protestant
and
to
win
big
in
the
western
coal
region
where
clinton
gained
support
from
progun
workingclass
voters
but
mccain
is
up
against
determined
obama
volunteers

the

in

has
not

for

in
one
of
the
biggest
surprises
of
this
long

season
obama
has
pulled
even
in
the

with

the

propelled

toward
his

this

and
his

hoped
that
his
nonconformist
brand
of
republicanism
would
be
an
easy
sell
for
the
general
election
in

however
sen

the

has
taken
a
commanding
lead
in

here
still

are
a
capricious
bunch
as

surprise
victory
over

in
the

proved
obama
had
a
doubledigit
lead
in
some
polls
going
into
the
primary
in
january
and
his
startling
defeat
is
reason
for
some
to
believe
that
mccain
still
has
a
shot
to
that
end
mccain
is
returning
to
the
state
this
weekend
new

has

twice
said

at

despite
new
hampshires
longtime

for

the
state
has
been
trending
democratic
for
years
research
by
the
university

suggests
that
a
third
of
the
states
electorate
is
new
since
2000
when
george
w
bush
defeated
al
gore
here
the
research
found
that
more
than
half
of
these
new
voters
are
democrats
so
why
should
mccain
bother
returning
to
the
state
his
theme
of
obama
meaning
higher
taxes
really
resonates
here
donahue
said
no

what
the
polls
say
the
week
before
the
election
new
hampshire
voters
make
their
final
decision
in
the
last

days
mccain
knows
it
and
thats
why
hes
coming

too
think
the

is
closer
than
it
seems
one
of

surrogates
former

is
to

here
sunday
and
in

warned

not
to
get
complacent
ray

of

said
it
was
undertaking
the
largest
getoutthevote
effort
in
state
history
with
more
than
3000
volunteers
canvassing
neighborhoods
and
working
phones
buckley
said
the
effort
would
focus
on
bluecollar
cities
won
by
clinton
in
january
including
nashua
manchester
and
rochester
the
republicans
were
also
homing
in
on
areas
that
embraced
clinton
with
a
betterorganized
betteroiled
machine
than
even
bush

had
said
fergus
cullen

an

this

with

and
wideopen
spaces
is
not
used
to
seeing
presidential
candidates
but
this
year
many
montanans
have
been
pleasantly
surprised
sen
barack
obama
has
run
an
aggressive
campaign
here
spending
about
160000
a
week
on
advertising
and
visiting
the
state
five
times
during
the
campaign
including
spending
the
fourth
of

in

that
kind
of
attention
is
unheard
of
he
has
a
real
shot
pat
williams
a
former
longtime
democratic
congressman
from
montana
said
of
obama
part
of
it
is
his
incessant
traveling
in
montana
and
the
lack
of
a
single
footprint
by
mccain
but
there
is
one
unpredictable
factor
that
may
help
decide
the
race
ron
paul
the
libertarian
texas
congressman
running
on
the
constitutional
party
line
here
pauls
supporters
here
asked
if
they
could
put
his
name
on
the
ballot
he
agreed
then
changed
his
mind
but
his
request
to
be
taken
off
the
ballot
came
too
late
now
polls
show
him
drawing
4
percent
and
he
is
particularly
popular
among
conservative
voters
in
this
independentminded
state
just
the
kind
of
voters
sen
john
mccain
the
republican
presidential
nominee
needs
with
polls
suggesting
a
close
race
the
republicans
are
mounting
a
lastminute
push
the
republican
national
committee
was
planning
to
spend
300000
to
400000
in
these
final
days
of
the
race
most
of
it
on
television
advertising
some
republicans
think
montana
will
be
an
uphill
battle
for
obama
the
democratic
nominee
particularly
because
of
the
issue
of
gun
control
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
given
his
radical
view
on
guns
that
hes
doing
as
well
as
he
is
said
joe
balyeat
a
republican
state
senator
and
gunrights
supporter
i
think
mccain
will
win
hunting
and
shooting
sports
are
a
way
of
life
here
while
obama
has
said
he
would
not
take
guns
away
from
people
balyeat
thinks
otherwise
the
last
time
a
democrat
won
a
presidential
election
in
montana
was
bill
clinton
in
1992
and
that
victory
was
chalked
up
to
ross
perots
presence
in
the
race
and
his
siphoning
of
a
substantial
number
of
votes
from
the
elder
president
george
bush
but
the
current
president
bush
carried
the
state
by
20
percent
in
2000
and
2004
obama
has
worked
hard
to
win
the
state
and
his
work
has
gone
beyond
just
visiting
he
has
opened
19
campaign
offices
here
while
mccain
has
none
those
offices
are
a
base
for
obamas
drive
to
turn
out
sympathetic
voters

missouri

to
be
fighting
for

in

including
those

normally
hostile
to
a
liberal

sen
john
mccain
has
also
campaigned
heavily
here
as
has
his
running
mate
gov
sarah
palin
and
polls
show
the
race
in
missouri
tighter
than
anywhere
in
the
nation
the
tradition
here
is
for
democrats
to
run
up
majorities
in
st
louis
and
kansas
city
and
republicans
to
dominate
in
the
dozens
of
rural
counties
in
between
leaving
both
parties
to
fight
over
the
suburbs
around
the
two
big

that
is
a
pattern
that
thanks
to
pocketbook
issues
would
seem
to
benefit

he
has
put
the

but
obama
faces

in
that
three
of

themselves
as
evangelical
christians
compared
with
about
a

mccain
won

narrowly
receiving
less
than
a
third
of
the
vote
and
narrowly
defeating

gov
mike
huckabee
of

so
a

question
especially
in

the
state
is
whether
the
religious
right
will
put
aside
its
reservations
about
mccain
and
vote
for
him
or
stay
home
huckabee
and
mitt
romney
have
been
campaigning
vigorously
for
their
former
rival
but
it
could
prove
decisive
if
even
a
few
evangelicals
defect
to
obama
who
has
also
been
wooing
them
that
is
why
mccain
is
counting
on
social
conservatives

on

sen
barack
obamas
campaign
began
broadcasting
two
commercials
here
in
a
sign
of
its
renewed
hopes
that
georgia
could
be
truly
competitive
in
this
election
it
was
a
swift
turnaround
the
campaign
initially
had
georgia
on
its
wish
list
but
just
two
months
ago
it
went
off
the
air
here
and
moved
out
some
of
its
paid
staff
members
sen
john
mccains
campaign
meanwhile
treated
georgia
as
an
automatic
win
but
then
came
the
reports
from
early
polling
stations
people
were
waiting
more
than
four
hours
in
some
places
to
cast
their
ballots
and
35
percent
of
them
were
black
by
the
time
early

closed
on
friday
more
than
17
million
of
georgias
56
million
registered
voters
had
cast
their
ballots
and
many
of
them
were
in
leftleaning
urban
counties
in
and
around
atlanta
where
support
for
obama
is
at
a
fever
pitch
i
feel
like
this
is
the
year
out
of
every
other
year
in
history
that
georgia
could
go
for
a
democrat
said
triniece
britt
a
client
relations
manager
at
a
mortgage
company
and
an
obama
supporter
who
was
waiting
in
a
fourhour
line
to
vote
on
friday
people
are
hungry
for
something
different
people
want
change
so
bad
that
theyll
wait
as
long
it
takes
what
remains
to
be
seen
is
the
demographics
of
the
turnout
on
election
day
analysts
are
not
certain
if
it
will
be
overwhelmingly
white
or
if
it
will
more
closely
mirror
the
demographics
of
the
electorate
which
is
29
percent
black
keeping
black
turnout
high
if
its
anything
close
to
30
percent
in
the
end
that
would
give
obama
a
big
chance
said
alan
abramowitz
a
political
science
professor
at
emory
university
the
long
lines
at
early
polling
stations
have
also
raised
concerns
that
the
voting
system
is
not
equipped
to
handle
an
expected
surge
on
election
day
matt
towery
a
republican
political
consultant
and
pollster
said
he
would
not
be
surprised
if
the
margin
of
victory
in
georgia
came
down
to
10000
or
20000
votes

well
within
battleground
range
just
six
years
ago
he
noted
the
state
was
controlled
by
democrats
but
lately
the
partys
base
has
not
turned
out
because
barack
obama
is
running
he
has
brought
that
democratic
voting
base
back
out
towery
said
if
georgia
votes
at
full
strength
then
its
a
highly
competitive
state
he
added
you
cannot
be
the
fastestgrowing
state
in
the
nation
for

and
be
drifting

moriarty
said
my

hes

he
has
never
voted
for
a
democrat
in
his
entire
life
until
tuesday
perhaps
no
state
in
recent
presidential
politics
is
more
resonant
than
florida
which
democrats
would
love
to
recapture
after
two
consecutive
defeats
that
included
the
bitter
recount
of
2000
and
florida
is
a
state
that
sen
john
mccain
must
win
to
capture
the
presidency
but
after
coasting
through
the
summer
mccain
the
republican
nominee
now
finds
himself
falling
behind
in
many
recent
polls
sen
barack
obama
the
democratic
presidential
nominee
has
a
litany
of
structural
advantages
to
help
him
retake
florida
for
the
democrats
with
only
days
to
go
the
obama
campaign
has
more
of
just
about
everything

and

democratic
edge
over
republicans
up
from
280000
in

none
of
this
is

of

in

an
unpredictable
state
every

since

50
of
them
shows
a
gap
of
single

between
the
candidates
which
could
be
closed
by
any
number
of
lastsecond
surprises
mccain
who
spent
time
stationed
here
in
the
navy
has
recently
revived
what
had
been
a
flagging
effort
on
oct
23
he
crisscrossed
florida
from
daytona
beach
to
sarasota
hammering
energetically
on
an
economic
theme
telling
audiences
that
obamas
tax
increases
would
put
even
more
people
out
of
work
with
unemployment
in
florida
at
its
highest
rate
in
14
years
the
message
will
no
doubt
be
heard
the
state
and
national
republican
party
has
also
amplified
the
argument
with
television
advertisements
and
one
particularly
blunt
mailer
that
said
barack
obamas
solution
is
to
take
more
of
your
money
but
according
to
analysts
and
voters
the
shift
toward
economic
issues
amounts
to
mccain
playing
on
the
democrats
turf
putting
florida
once
again
in
the
crosshairs
of
both
campaigns
we
need
to
bring
our
best
game
these
last
couple
days
before

the

is
that
a
big
piece
of
the
election
is
already
over
the

heavy
emphasis

46

of

john
mccain
is
still
trying
to
costume
barack
obama
as
a
dangerous
enigma
but
in
an
odd
and
remarkable
reversal
it
is
mccain
who
is
the
enigma
even
though
he
entered
the
race
with
one
of
the
best
brands
in
american
politics
and
it
is
obama
who
sashayed
onto
the
trail
two
years
ago
as
an
aloof
and
exotic
mystery
man
with
a
slim
record
and
a
strange
name
now
coming
across
as
the
steadier
brand
the
mccain
campaign
specializes
in
erratica
while
the
obama
campaign
continues
to
avoid
any
dramatica
mccain
pals
around
with
joe
the
plumber
and
leaves
tito
the
builder
to
sarah
palin
exactly
the
kind
of
inane
campaign
silliness
that
the
mccain
formerly
known
as
maverick
would
have
mocked
mercilessly
hes
getting
a
little
traction
on
taxes
as
he
latches
on
to
every
possible
scary
image
about
obama

except
the
suggestion
that
the
democrats
gray
hart
schaffner
marx
suits
are
red
before
he
was
bubbled
by
bushies
mccain
was
one
of
the
most
known
and
knowable
quantities
in
american
politics
for
most
of
his
long
public
career
he
prided
himself
on
his
openness
with
the
press

he
even
allowed
some
reporters
to
watch
the
results
of
januarys
new
hampshire
primary
in
his
hotel
suite
in
nashua
he
relished
spending
all
day
being
challenged
by
voters
and
reporters
last
summer
tapped
out
and
unable
to
afford
a
paid
staff
of
political
professionals
he
talked
freely
telling
reporters
he
would
have
a
white
house
that
would
be
the
polar
opposite
of
the
secretive
and
dismissive
bushcheney
operation
he
imagined
weekly
press
conferences
and
talked
of
subjecting
himself
to
a
version
of
british
question
time
in
congress
while
acknowledging
he
was
a
tech
tyro
he
promised
to
try
a
google
as
he
called
searching
the
web
to
put
government
spending
online
so
citizens
could
birddog
it
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
spin
a
dream
of
a
west
wing
in
which
he
would
cut
back
on
his
secret
service
so
he
wouldnt
feel
so
constrained
in
the
end
the
bullet
or
sarge
as
mccain
calls
his
replacement
campaign
manager
steve
schmidt
was
the
one
who
did
the
shackling
turning
the
vibrant
and
respected
mccain
into
a
shell
of
his
former
self
schmidt
abruptly
cut
off
the
oxygen
supply
to
mccains
brain
no
more
of
the
oldest
established
permanent
floating
craps
game
of
press
confabs
no
more
audiences
that
werent
vetted
for
friendliness
no
more
of
mccains
trademark
insouciant
mocking
the
process
even
as
he
participated
in
it
whether
it
was
the
five
years
he
spent
in
a
hole
in
hanoi
or
just
his
gregarious
makeup
mccain
seemed
to
feed
off
of
the
company
of
people
who
interested
him
be
it
reporters
voters
or
the
pols
in
his
posse
like
joe
lieberman
and
lindsey
graham
unlike
obama
he
who
walks
alone
mccain
always
rejected
the
solitary
in
favor
of
the
social
but
ever
since
sgt
schmidt
put
capt
mccain
into
a
sterile
brig
on
the
trail
the
candidate
has
become
a
question
mark
why
would
he
repeat
that
oblivious
line
about
the
fundamentals
of
the
economy
being
strong
saying
it
once
in
august
and
again
in
september
why
would
he
threaten
to
not
show
up
for
a
debate
after
denouncing
obama
for
not
rising
to
the
challenge
of
joint
town
halls
so
that
he
could
go
to
washington
and
play
the
shining
knight
if
he
had
no
plan
and
no
prospect
for
success
why
did
he
allow
his
campaign
to
become
a
host
body
for
a
bush
virus
looking
for
someplace
to
infect
after
working
so
hard
to
erase
the
image
of
what
senate
aides
called
the
bush
hug
mccain
inexplicably
hugged
bushies
surrounding
himself
with
mercenaries
trained
in
the
same
rovian
tactics
that
tore
up
his
family

and
tore
apart
his
campaign

in
2000
why
did
a
politician
who
once
knew
how
to
play
the
game
so
well
who
was
once
so
beloved
by
people
of
very
different
political
stripes
allow
his
campaign
to
get
whiny
angry
vengeful
and
bitter
why
palin
her
latest
instant
classics
came
friday
when
she
entered
a
rally
in
york
pa
to
the
tune
of
thriller
and
when
a
conservative
radio
station
broadcast
an
interview
in
which
she
accused
reporters
of
threatening
her
first
amendment
rights
by
attacking
her
for
negative
campaigning
that
she
feels
justifiably
calls
out
obama
on
his
associations
why
did
he
allow
his
staff
to
put
palin
on
a
couture
catwalk
in
a
tincup
economy
and
then
when
the
price
tags
were
exposed
trash
her
as
a
diva
and
whack
job
thus
becoming
the
rare
republican
campaign
devoured
by
democraticstyle
vicious
infighting
the
ultimate
riddle
is
this
why
doesnt
mccain
question
why
he
has
become
a
question
mark
after
weeks
of
testimony
about
a
suitcase
stuffed
with
illegal
campaign
contributions
bound
for
buenos
aires
a
federal
jury
here
remains
undecided
about
the
role
of
a
venezuelan
businessman
the
businessman
franklin
duran
is
charged
with
conspiracy
and
with
operating
in
the
united
states
as
an
unauthorized
agent
of
a
foreign
government
prosecutors
say
duran
who
owns
a
house
in
the
miami
area
came
to
the
united
states
at
the
behest
of
the
venezuelan
government
to
coerce
a
friend
to
conceal
the
source
and
destination
of
an
800000
cash
contribution
to
the
2007
campaign
of
an
argentine
presidential
candidate
cristina
fernandez
de
kirchner
who
went
on
to
win
the
election
jurors
have
deliberated
for
seven
days
but
remain
deadlocked
earlier
this
week
they
sent
a
note
to
judge
joan
a
lenard
saying
they
were
at
an
impasse
lenard
instructed
them
to
continue
deliberating
both
kirchner
and
her
venezuelan
counterpart
president
hugo
chavez
have
denied
any
role
in
the
matter
which
has
made
headlines
in
latin
america
the
jurys
impasse
has
prompted
some
venezuelans
to
speculate
in
news
blogs
and
internet
chat
rooms
that
the
chavez
administration
is
somehow
manipulating
the
jury
to
prevent
a
guilty
verdict
if
he
is
found
guilty
those
that
are
antichavez
will
be
happy
said
laura
weffer
an
investigative
reporter
for
the
leading
venezuelan
newspaper
el
nacional
who
has
covered
the
duran
trial
from
its
inception
in
september
but
if
there
is
a
mistrial
they
will
say
he
bought
the
jurors
deliberations
could
continue
until
late
next
week
a
defense
lawyer
said
as
the
jurors
will
convene
for
an
abbreviated
session
on
monday
and
be
pardoned
from
court
altogether
tuesday
because
two
jurors
have
a
conflict
that
day
heres
what
strikes
me
this
election
eve
i
cant
remember
a
presidential
campaign
that
was
so
disconnected
from
the
actual
challenges
of
governing
that
will
confront
the
winner
the
morning
after
when
this
election
campaign
began
two
years
ago
the
big
issue
was
how
and
for
how
long
we
continue
nationbuilding
in
iraq
as
the
campaign
comes
to
a
close
the
big
issue
is
how
and
at
what
sacrifice
we
do
nationbuilding
in
america
unfortunately
youd
barely
know
that
from
the
presidential
debates
watching
them
in
the
context
of
the
meltdown
of
the
financial
system
was
like
watching
a
game
show
where
the
two
contestants
were
kept
offstage
in
a
soundproof
booth
and
brought
out
to
address
the
audience
without
knowing
the
context
since
the
last
debate
john
mccain
and
barack
obama
have
unveiled
broad
ideas
about
how
to
restore
the
nations
financial
health
but
they
continue
to
suggest
that
this
will
be
largely
painfree
mccain
says
giving
everyone
a
tax
cut
will
save
the
day
obama
tells
us
only
the
rich
will
have
to
pay
to
help
us
out
of
this
hole
neither
is
true
we
are
all
going
to
have
to
pay
because
this
meltdown
comes
in
the
context
of
what
has
been
perhaps
the
greatest
wealth
transfer
since
the
bolshevik
revolution
in
russia
in
1917
says
michael
mandelbaum
author
of
democracys
good
name
it
is
not
a
wealth
transfer
from
rich
to
poor
that
the
bush
administration
will
be
remembered
for
it
is
a
wealth
transfer
from
the
future
to
the
present
never
has
one
generation
spent
so
much
of
its
childrens
wealth
in
such
a
short
period
of
time
with
so
little
to
show
for
it
as
in
the
bush
years
under
george
w
bush
america
has
foisted
onto
future
generations
a
huge
financial
burden
to
finance
our
current
tax
cuts
wars
and
now
bailouts
just
paying
off
those
debts
will
require
significant
sacrifices
but
when
you
add
the
destruction
of
wealth
that
has
taken
place
in
the
last
two
months
in
the
markets
and
the
need
for
more
bailouts
you
understand
why
this
is
not
going
to
be
a
painless
recovery
the
bush
team
leaves
us
with
another
debt

one
to
mother
nature
we
have
added
tons
more
co2
into
the
atmosphere
these
last
eight
years
without
any
mitigation
effort
as
a
result
slowing
down
climate
change
in
the
next
eight
years
is
going
to
require
even
bigger
changes
and
investments
in
how
we
use
energy
given
that
new
york
times
columnists
are
not
allowed
to
formally
endorse
candidates
and
given
that
the
context
of
this
election
has
changed
so
much
from
the
policy
positions
the
candidates
started
with
all
i
can
suggest
is
that
you
vote
for
the
candidate
with
these
character
traits
first
we
need
a
president
who
can
speak
english
and
deconstruct
and
navigate
complex
issues
so
americans
can
make
informed
choices
we
have
paid
an
enormous
price
for
having
a
president
who
could
not
explain
and
reassure
us
during
this
financial
meltdown
we
wasted
a
huge
amount
of
time
pretending
that
we
could
punish
wall
street
without
punishing
main
street

when
in
fact
they
are
intricately
intertwined
a
major
money
market
fund

reserve
primary

failed
in
september
because
the
extra
interest
it
offered
customers
derived
in
part
from
the
785
million
in
highyielding
lehman
brothers
commercial
paper
and
notes
it
was
holding
depositors
who
told
their
congressmen
to
just
let
that
greedy
lehman
brothers
fail
were
shocked
to
discover
this
meant
that
their
own
money
market
would
be
frozen
no
we
dont
need
a
president
defending
greed
on
wall
street
but
we
do
need
one
who
can
explain
that
we
are
all
in
the
same
boat
that
a
leak
at
one
end
can
sink
everyone
and
that
while
we
must
regulate
we
dont
want
to
kill
risktaking
and
the
rewards
that
go
with
that

which
are
essential
to
growing
our
economy
second
we
need
a
president
who
can
energize
inspire
and
hold
the
country
together
during
what
will
be
a
very
stressful
recovery
we
have
to
climb
out
of
this
financial
crisis
at
a
time
when
the
baby
boomers
are
about
to
retire
and
going
to
need
their
social
security
and
eventually
medicare
we
are
all
going
to
be
paying
the
government
more
and
getting
less
until
we
grow
out
of
this
hole
third
we
need
a
president
who
can
rally
the
world
to
our
side
we
cannot
get
out
of
this
crisis
unless
china
starts
consuming
more
and
unless
europe
keeps
lowering
interest
rates
everyone
is
interconnected
and
everyone
is
still
looking
to
america
to
lead
so
bottom
line
please
do
not
vote
for
the
candidate
you
most
want
to
have
a
beer
with
unless
its
to
get
stonecold
drunk
so
you
dont
have
to
think
about
this
mess
were
in
vote
for
the
person
youd
most
like
at
your
side
when
you
ask
your
bank
manager
for
an
extension
on
your
mortgage
vote
for
the
candidate
you
think
has
the
smarts
temperament
and
inspirational
capacity
to
unify
the
country
and
steer
our
ship
through
what
could
be
the
rockiest
shoals
our
generation
has
ever
known
your
kids
will
thank
you
the
supreme
court
specializes
in
law
not
lexicography
but
it
will
soon
have
to
consider
the
meaning
of
that
most
versatile
of
fourletter
words
the
oxford
english
dictionarys
three
core
entries
on
the
word

noun
verb
and
interjection

are
about
six
times
as
long
as
this
article
that
doesnt
count
about
30
derivations
and
compounds
all
colorful
and
many
recent
the
nimble
word
the
dictionary
tells
us
can
help
express
that
a
person
is
incompetent
that
another
is
not
be
meddled
with
that
a
situation
has
been
botched
that
one
does
not
have
the
slightest
clue
and
in
a
recent
addition
that
someone
has
enough
money
to
be
able
to
quit
an
unpleasant
job
you
know
the
word
i
mean
a
central
question
in
the
case
of
federal
communications
commission
v
fox
television
stations
to
be
argued
tuesday
is
whether
every
permutation
of
the
word
evokes
sex
and
thus
runs
afoul
of
indecency
regulations
which
prohibit
the
broadcasting
of
material
that
depicts
or
describes
sexual
or
excretory
activities
or
organs
given
its
core
meaning
the
commission
told
the
court
any
use
of
the
word
has
a
sexual
connotation
even
if
the
word
is
not
used
literally
thus
when
the
pop
star
bono
emphasized
his
glee
at
receiving
a
golden
globe
award
in
2003
by
saying
his
victory
was
really
really

insert
a
form
of
the
word
here

brilliant
the
commission
contended
there
was
a
sexual
element
so
too
when
cher
on
another
awards
show
used
the
word
to
propose
something
that
ought
to
be
done
to
her
critics
and
there
was
sex
in
the
air
the
commission
said
when
nicole
richie
at
a
third
awards
show
veered
from
these
scripted
comments
have
you
ever
tried
to
get
cow
manure
out
of
a
prada
purse
its
not
so
freaking
simple
richie
did
not
say
manure
and
she
did
not
say
freaking
bono
cher
and
richie
all
made
sexual
references
and
all
were
indecent
the
commission
says
it
hardly
seems
debatable
the
commission
wrote
in
2006
that
the
words
power
to
intensify
and
offend
derives
from
its
implicit
sexual
meaning
as
one
of
the
most
vulgar
graphic
and
explicit
words
for
sexual
activity
in
the
english
language
the
federal
appeals
court
in
new
york
disagreed
as
the
general
public
well
knows
judge
rosemary
s
pooler
wrote
for
the
majority
last
year
fourletter
words
are
often
used
in
everyday
conversation
without
any
sexual
or
excretory
meaning
bonos
exclamation
pooler
added
is
a
prime
example
of
a
nonliteral
use
that
has
no
sexual
connotation
in
support
of
that
proposition
she
cited
remarks
from
president
bush
about
the
need
to
get
hezbollah
to
stop
doing
uh
stuff
and
vice
president
dick
cheney
urging
sen
patrick
leahy
to
start
doing
something
not
biologically
possible
a
dissenting
judge
pierre
n
leval
agreed
that
many
people
who
use
the
most
adaptable
curse
word
do
not
intend
to
refer
to
sex
he
gave
examples
a
student
who
gets
a
disappointing
grade
on
a
test
a
cook
who
burns
the
roast
or
a
driver
who
returns
to
his
parked
car
to
find
a
parking
ticket
on
the
windshield
but
whatever
the
speakers
intentions
leval
added
a
substantial
part
of
the
community
and
of
the
television
audience
will
understand
the
word
as
freighted
with
an
offensive
sexual
connotation
the
commission
on
the
other
hand
has
not
been
entirely
consistent
swearing
in
saving
private
ryan
the
steven
spielberg
war
movie
not
indecent
swearing
by
blues
masters
and
others
in
a
music
documentary
produced
by
martin
scorsese
indecent
swearing
on
the
the
early
show
on
cbs
not
indecent
because
the
bad
word
was
part
of
a
bona
fide
news
interview
protected
by
the
first
amendment
the
foulmouthed
subject
of
said
bona
fide
news
interview
a
contestant
on
survivor
vanuatu
thirty
years
ago
the
supreme
court
allowed
the
commission
to
censor
george
carlins
famous
seven
dirty
words
monologue
it
justified
the
decision
by
saying
that
broadcasting
was
uniquely
pervasive
and
uniquely
accessible
to
children
peter
chernin
the
president
of
news
corp
which
owns
fox
said
much
had
changed
since
the
decision
in
the
carlin
case
fcc
v
pacifica
foundation
that
decision
he
said
is
an
artifact
of
a
world
without
the
internet
or
cable
television
programming
neither
of
which
is
subject
to
government
indecency
regulation
the
government
is
turning
a
blind
eye
to
99
percent
of
the
content
thats
being
delivered
chernin
said
viewers
who
subscribe
to
cable
switch
between
regulatory
regimes
by
changing
channels
he
said
leaving
broadcasters
at
an
inexplicable
competitive
disadvantage
even
in
the
pacifica
case
the
court
moved
cautiously
it
emphasized
carlins
repetitive
deliberate
use
of
swear
words
and
left
open
the
question
of
whether
an
occasional
expletive
would
be
considered
indecent
in
other
settings
the
court
has
protected
vulgarity
in
1971
for
instance
the
court
ruled
that
it
was
not
obscene
to
say
about
the
vietnam
draft
what
cher
said
about
her
critics
such
expression
must
be
in
some
significant
way
erotic
before
it
crosses
the
line
into
obscenity
justice
john
marshall
harlan
wrote
for
the
majority
in
cohen
v
california
it
cannot
plausibly
be
maintained
that
this
vulgar
allusion
to
the
selective
service
system
would
conjure
up
such
psychic
stimulation
judicial
opinions
about
salty
language
like
sermons
about
sin
are
the
work
of
amateurs
jesse
sheidlower
the
editor
at
large
of
the
oxford
english
dictionary
is
a
professional
i
spent
much
of
last
year
revising
the
oeds
entry
on
it
sheidlower
said
of
the
word
in
an
interview
the
other
day
sheidlower
is
also
preparing
a
third
edition
of
his
book
on
the
subject
the
fword
that
euphemism
according
to
the
dictionary
first
appeared
in
1973
in
this
newspaper
the
power
of
the
word
to
shock
is
in
decline
sheidlower
said
largely
because
its
core
meaning
has
been
blurred
the
word
he
said
has
been
around
since
the
late
15th
century
and
almost
all
of
the
nonsexual
uses
are
quite
recent
say
late
victorian
or
later
the
word
has
seldom
been
in
any
event
the
most
offensive
one
around
words
suggesting
questionable
parentage

bastard
whoreson

were
long
thought
more
offensive
blasphemous
words
have
also
gotten
people
into
more
trouble
these
days
a
racial
slur
can
end
a
career
sheidlower
said
he
had
followed
the
court
case
and
did
not
find
it
difficult
the
outrage
that
the
fcc
pretends
to
feel
is
false
he
said
im
highly
opposed
to
censorship
in
any
form
he
added
this
is
censorship
having
said
that
i
dont
encourage
this
word
to
be
very
commonly
broadcast
at
all
times
whenever
anyone
feels
like
it
on
friday
the
supreme
court
turned
down
a
request
from
cspan
for
prompt
access
to
an
audiotape
of
tuesdays
argument
the
court
which
occasionally
grants
such
access
gave
no
reasons
but
foxs
lead
lawyer
has
said
that
he
will
not
be
relying
on
euphemisms
chicago
is
bracing
for
a
gigantic
crowd
this
week
in
grant
park
the
citys
iconic
front
yard
where
sen
barack
obama
has
chosen
to
spend
election
night
as
many
as
70000
people
are
expected
to
attend
an
event
for
local
supporters
all
available
tickets
were
swept
up
days
ago
and
thousands
of
people
have
applied
to
be
on
a
waiting
list
thousands
more

maybe
as
many
as
a
million
people
mayor
richard
m
daley
has
proudly
suggested

are
expected
to
pile
into
the
downtown
parkland
and
sidewalks
and
streets
surrounding
obamas
official
celebration
this
could
be
a
moment
of
history
right
here
and
its
high
time
for
it
said
patricia
cadagin
who
stood
last
week
peering
through
a
new
fence
around
the
south
end
of
grant
park
one
of
blocks
and
blocks
of
fences
erected
as
part
of
the
elaborate
security
efforts
cadagin
82
who
said
she
had
voted
early
for
obama
will
probably
not
be
here
on
tuesday
night
its
going
to
be
a
big
crowd
and
at
night
and
im
a
small
woman
she
said
will
i
be
here
in
spirit
you
bet
you
chicago
it
seems
is
of
two
minds
about
this
party
many
supporters
in
obamas
hometown
speak
with
pride
of
the
potential
of
seeing
the
first
black
person
claim
victory
in
a
presidential
campaign
here
on
the
edge

about
how
a
huge
crowd
in
this

which
has

like
basketball

might
respond

a
fierce
obama
supporter
seemed
to
suggest
the
more
the
merrier
you
think
im
not
going
to
invite

down
he
told

according
to
the

this
is
a
celebration
a
day
later
city

cautioned

said
the

we
cant
have
mischief
facing
labor

back
in
1990
but
ever
wary
of
allowing
in
foreigners
japan
made
an
exception
for
japanesebrazilians
with
their
japanese
roots
names
and
faces
these
children
and
grandchildren
of
japanese
immigrants
to
brazil
would
fit
more
easily
in
a
society
fiercely
closed
to
outsiders
or
so
the
reasoning
went
in
the
two
decades
since
then
despite
periodic
economic
downturns
like
the
current
one
the
number
of
japanesebrazilian
workers
in
japan
has
kept
growing
they
are
clustered
in
industrial
regions
dotted
with
factories
supplying
familiar
companies
like
honda
sanyo
and
toyota
whose
headquarters
gave
this
city
in
central
japan
its
name
but
perhaps
nowhere
in
this
country
do
japanese
and
japanesebrazilians
rub
shoulders
with
such
intensity
as
in
a
public
housing
complex
here
called
homi
estate
built
in
the
1970s
for
young
japanese
families
homi
has
a
population
of
8891
that
is
now
nearly
evenly
split
between
japanese
at
52
percent
and
foreigners
at
48
percent
to
be
honest
toshinori
fujiwara

a
japanese
community
leader
said
i
never
imagined
in
my
wildest
dreams
that
this
would
ever
become
a
multiethnic
neighborhood
a
generation
from
now
more
japanese
are
likely
to
be
making
similar
comments
as
japans
population
ages
and
its
work
force
shrinks
recently
labor
shortages
have
spread
from
factories
to
farms
fishing
boats
hospitals
and
other
areas
prompting
japan
to
open
its
doors
to
temporary
workers
from
china
and
elsewhere
in
asia
as
the
demographic
squeeze
grows
tighter
japan
may
have
to
open
itself
further
to
immigration
experts
say
if
it
is
to
have
the
workers
it
needs
to
remain
a
major
industrial
power
a
homogeneous
and
insular
nation
however
japan
is
notoriously
unwelcoming
to
immigrants
koreans
who
came
here
during
world
war
ii
are
still
treated
as
secondclass
citizens
to
make
itself
an
attractive
destination
for
immigrants
the
experts
say
japan
will
have
to
undergo
a
difficult
cultural
transformation
for
which
the
japanesebrazilians
pose
an
elementary
test
case
if
even
they
cannot
gain
acceptance
what
chance
will
there
be
forimmigrant
groups
that
may
be
ethnically
racially
religiously
and
nationally
different
from
native
japanese
immigration
is
an
unpopular
and
politically
delicate
topic
but
the
countrys
317000
japanesebrazilians

whose
children
are
growing
up
in
japan
and
in
many
cases
coming
of
age
here

effectively
make
up
japans
largest
immigrant
population
some
audiences
for
the
upcoming
film
milk
about
the
slain
san
francisco
supervisor
and
gay
politician
harvey
milk
will
certainly
be
inspired
by
his
fight
against
proposition
6
a
1978
california
ballot
measure
that
would
have
expelled
gay
teachers
from
the
states
public
schools
others
less
entranced
with
milks
politics
will
no
doubt
be
less
impressed
but
in
california
both
types
of
moviegoers
will
probably
feel
a
sense
of
eerie
familiarity
the
state
is
embroiled
in
a
fight
over
another
numbered
ballot
measure
aimed
at
gays
that
will
be
put
to
voters
on
tuesday
proposition
8
which
would
bar
samesex
marriage
in
many
ways
the
battle
sparked
by
this
latest
proposal
echoes
the
one
that
inspired
milks
most
famous
crusade
its
surreal
said
cleve
jones
a
veteran
civil
rights
activist
who
is
portrayed
by
a
curly
headed
emilie
hirsch
in
the
film
its
like
theres
a
30year
cycle
call
it
life
imitating
milk
or
vice
versa
but
the
parallels
between
the
campaign
chronicled
in
the
movie
and
the
reallife
battle
over
proposition
8
are
striking
social
conservatives
pitted
against
gay
activists
check
a
republican
governor
and
former
movie
star
siding
with
gay
californians
check
close
polls
a
nationally
watched
campaign
the
potential
for
heartbreak
check
check
check
one
of
the
most
obvious
similarities
is
the
role
that
children
have
played
in
both
campaigns
as
political
symbols
in
1978
supporters
of
proposition
6
suggested
that
gay
people
might
aim
to
convert
and
molest
children
recent
advertisements
for
proposition
8
have
asserted
that
gay
marriage
will
be
taught
in
schools
to
young
children
im
all
for
tolerance
everyones
for
tolerance
but
how
do
you
explain
to
a
kindergartener
what
a
bisexual
is
said
sonja
eddingsbrown
a
spokeswoman
for
protect
marriage
the
leading
group
behind
proposition
8
opponents
of
the
ballot
measure
deny
the
school
claim
but
it
isnt
accidental
schools
are
still
there
as
part
of
the
story
because
whatever
their
politics
families
are
conservative
when
it
comes
to
their
kids
said
david
l
kirp
a
professor
of
law
and
public
policy
at
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
no
family
regards
their
kids
as
a
social
experiment
proposition
6
was
hatched
in
california
just
days
after
the
singer
and
antigay
activist
anita
bryant
successfully
led
an
effort
to
overturn
an
antidiscrimination
law
in
miami
in
1977
at
the
films
premiere
in
san
francisco
last
tuesday
the
crowd
hissed
when
bryant
appeared
on
screen
the
2008
battle
has
also
been
influenced
by
forces
beyond
californias
borders
with
both
sides
receiving
major
financial
support
from
groups
based
outside
of
the
state
many
analysts
say
the
critical
factor
in
defeating
proposition
6
was
ronald
reagan
then
the
former
governor
who
said
it
would
be
costly
to
implement
and
infringed
on
the
basic
rights
of
privacy
this
time
around
gov
arnold
schwarzenegger
another
hollywood
republican
has
come
out
against
proposition
8
and
as
in
1978
the
election
on
tuesday
is
likely
to
be
a
nailbiter
a
field
poll
released
last
friday
showed
49
percent
against
proposition
8
and
44
percent
for
the
measure
of
course
not
everyone
buys
into
the
parallels
between
the
two
campaigns
this
is
not
about
the
rights
of
gay
people
in
california
which
are
and
should
be
protected
said
frank
schubert
the
campaign
manager
for
protect
marriage
this
is
about
marriage
for
all
the
similarities
there
are
some
major
differences
between
then
and
now
particularly
the
changed
political
landscape
for
gay
americans
the
2008
vote
in
california
comes
after
a
decision
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
may
to
permit
samesex
marriages
made
california
the
second
state
after
massachusetts
to
do
so
connecticut
has
since
become
the
third
such
notions
were
fanciful
in
milks
time
said
art
agnos
a
former
mayor
of
san
francisco
and
sometime
political
sparring
partner
with
milk
had
someone
said
in
1978
that
you
would
have
the
right
to
marry
your
lover
youd
say
they
were
from
mars
he
said
jones
recalled
that
the
prospect
that
proposition
6

which
threatened
peoples
jobs

could
pass
was
far
more
frightening
i
and
all
of
my
contemporaries
felt
a
real
sense
of
physical
fear
he
said
of
the
1978
vote
i
dont
feel
that
this
time
for
all
that
theres
no
question
passions
are
still
running
fairly
high
at
the
films
premiere
on
tuesday
scores
of
antiproposition
8
protesters
chanted
outside
the
theater
even
as
actors
on
the
screen
inside
shouted
progay
rights
slogans
from
another
era
perhaps
the
biggest
difference
today
is
the
lack
of
charismatic
front
men
like
milk
who
was
assassinated
by
a
fellow
supervisor
dan
white
shortly
after
the
defeat
of
proposition
6
milk
one
of
the
countrys
first
openly
gay
elected
officials
became
the
face
of
the
antiproposition
6
campaign
by
challenging
its
major
sponsor
a
republican
state
senator
from
southern
california
to
a
series
of
debates
such
figures
are
harder
to
find
in
this
generation
of
gay
leaders
said
scott
schmidt
who
is
33
gay
opposed
to
proposition
8

and
a
republican
there
are
no
harvey
milks
in
this
campaign
he
said
sens
barack
obama
and
john
mccain
have
stood
or
sat
for
36
debates
endured
thousands
of
interviews
and
spent
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
on
advertisements
and
the
better
part
of
two
years
trying
to
convince
voters
that
they
are
worthy
of
the
presidency
or
at
least
a
vote
but
with
only
days
left
until
election
day
a
small
cluster
of
holdouts

4
percent
according
to
a
new
york
timescbs
news
poll

is
still
wrestling
with
the
who
are
you
voting
for
question
which
raises
a
followup
what
is
up
with
these
people
i
do
not
like
being
an
undecided
said
a
sheepish
doug
finke
a
66yearold
executive
at
an
international
relocation
service
in
louisville
ky
finke
a
republican
voted
twice
for
george
w
bush
he
describes
himself
as
an
economic
conservative
and
said
he
had
been
very
impressed
with
sen
john
mccain
it
sure
sounds
as
if
finke
is
leaning
toward
mccain
the
arizona
republican
right
not
so
fast
im
socially
more
liberal
finke
said
i
think
obama
is
bright
and
has
been
very
steady
in
this
campaign
he
added
that
it
would
be
very
exciting
for
the
united
states
to
elect
a
black
president
besides
he
does
not
think
mccains
running
mate
gov
sarah
palin
of
alaska
would
be
ready
to
step
into
the
top
job
if
something
happened
to
mccain
where
does
this
leave
finke
i
plan
on
doing
a
lot
of
reading
this
weekend
he
said
while
many
people
in
this
campaignsaturated
country
are
relieved
that
the
election
will
soon
be
over
some
of
the
undecideds
figure
whats
the
rush
i
might
flip
a
coin
said
vasilios
gerovasiliou
64
of
concordville
pa
his
two
grown
sons
are
split
along
party
lines
his
wife
helen
said
she
was
disgusted
with
both
sides
talking
does
not
necessarily
bring
undecideds
closer
to
deciding
the
more
i
chat
the
more
confused
i
get
said
laura
wolpo
a
brooklyn
ny
native
who
lives
in

beach
gardens
fla
wolpo
vows
to
vote
tuesday
either
way
she
said
her
decision
did
not
keep
her
awake
at
night
i
have
enough
to
worry
about
she
said
explaining
that
her
youngest
son
suffered
a
stroke
last
spring
he
has
good
days
and
bad
days
she
said
and
that
puts
everything
else
in
perspective
this
other
thing
is
just
an
election
she
said
an
unscientific
poll
of
109
professional
historians
this
year
found
that
61
percent
rated
president
bush
as
the
worst
president
in
american
history
a
couple
of
others
judged
him
secondworst
after
james
buchanan
whose
incompetence
set
the
stage
for
the
civil
war
more
than
98
percent
of
the
historians
in
the
poll
conducted
through
the
history
news
network
viewed
bushs
presidency
as
a
failure
bushs
presidency
imploded
not
because
of
any
personal
corruption
or
venality
but
largely
because
he
wrenched
the
united
states
out
of
the
international
community
his
cowboy
diplomacy
defriended
the
united
states
he
turned
a
superpower
into
a
rogue
country
instead
of
isolating
north
korea
and
iran
he
isolated
us

and
undermined
his
own
ability
to
achieve
his
aims
so
heres
the
top
priority
for
president
barack
obama
or
president
john
mccain
we
must
rejoin
the
world
there
are
three
general
ways
in
which
we
can
signal
a
new
beginning
and
refriend
our
allies

we
should
not
only
close
the
guantanamo
prison
but
also
turn
it
into
an
international
center
for
research
on
tropical
diseases
that
afflict
poor
countries
it
could
thus
become
an
example
of
multilateral
humanitarianism
the
new
president
should
also
start
a
truth
commission
to
investigate
torture
and
other
abuses
during
the
war
on
terror
this
should
not
be
a
bipartisan
panel
but
a
nonpartisan
one
dominated
by
retired
generals
and
intelligence
figures
like
brent
scowcroft
or
colin
powell
such
a
panel
would
be
respected
as
fair
and
authoritative
in
a
way
that
one
composed
of
bickering
democrats
and
republicans
would
not
and
it
would
underscore
that
we
are
eager
to
return
to
the
norms
of
the
civilized
world

the
new
president
also
should
signal
that
we
will
no
longer
confront
problems
just
by
blowing
them
up
the
military
toolbox
is
essential
but
it
shouldnt
be
the
first
option
for
21stcentury
challenges
you
cant
bomb
climate
change
we
also
have
to
pay
far
more
attention
to
public
diplomacy
and
outreach
our
afghanistan
and
pakistan
policy
is
a
mess
in
part
because
osama
bin
ladens
approval
rating
in
pakistan
34
percent
is
almost
double
americas
19
percent
you
know
we
need
a
new
approach
when
we
lose
a
public
relations
competition
to
a
fugitive
mass
murderer
a
new
approach
means
a
vigorous
effort
for
peace
in
the
middle
east
we
also
need
to
commit
to
negotiating
with
odious
countries
president
clintons
engagement
policy
toward
north
korea
was
a
constant
headache
for
kim
jong
il
was
brutally
repressive
and
tried
to
start
a
secret
uranium
program
but
north
korea
didnt
produce
nuclear
materials
for
a
single
weapon
during
clintons
years
in
office
under
bush
it
has
produced
enough
for
a
half
dozen
so
heres
the
score
clinton
diplomacy
0
weapons
bush
fulmination
6
weapons

we
must
cooperate
with
other
countries
on
humanitarian
efforts
including
family
planning
one
of
the
bush
follies
that
has
bewildered
and
antagonized
our
allies
has
been
the
vacuous
refusal
to
support
family
planning
through
the
un
population
fund
the
upshot
of
the
failure
to
support
contraception
has
been
millions
of
unwanted
pregnancies
and
abortions
its
difficult
to
think
of
any
person
alive
today
whose
policies
have
led
to
more
unnecessary
abortions
worldwide
than
bush
for
all
my
criticisms
though
i
would
rank
bush
more
gently
than
those
historians
i
would
peg
him
as
second
worst
after
buchanan
thats
because
bush
has
begun
effective
foreignaid
programs
against
aids
and
malaria
that
are
saving
millions
of
lives
his
aids
programs
have
transformed
areas
of
southern
africa
but
he
so
antagonized
the
world
that
america
never
gets
adequate
credit
for
this
huge
achievement
look
a
friendlier
more
multilateral
policy
will
not
solve
the
worlds
problems
iran
isnt
going
to
give
up
its
nuclear
program
because
it
likes
us
and
brawn
is
necessary
to
back
up
brains
but
without
global
political
capital
we
dont
have
the
leverage
to
organize
more
muscular
persuasion
without
diplomatic
heavy
lifting
we
cant
credibly
threaten
military
heavy
smashing
in
the
aftermath
of
world
war
ii
the
united
states
led
the
international
effort
to
construct
global
institutions
to
promote
peace
and
prosperity
these
included
the
united
nations
the
world
bank
and
the
international
monetary
fund
and
they
served
our
interests
now
in
the
aftermath
of
the
cold
war
we
need
to
rethink
and
refurbish
this
architecture
for
the
next
half
century
or
more
the
united
states
needs
to
be
a
part
of
the
international
criminal
court
and
should
lead
the
push
for
a
new
climate
change
treaty
for
example
the
new
president
should
be
an
architect
of
this
emerging
order
rather
than
awol
as
the
bush
administration
has
been
for
eight
years
the
united
states
has
been
in
selfimposed
exile
and
that
is
one
reason
bushs
presidency
has
failed
on
so
many
levels
after
tuesday
lets
rejoin
the
world
growing
up
in
st
louis
in
the
1950s
and
60s
deddrick
battle
came
to
believe
that
the
political
process
was
not
for
people
like
him

a
struggling
black
man
whose
vote
he
was
convinced
surely
would
not
count
for
much
of
anything
the
thought
became
ingrained
as
an
adult
almost
like
common
sense
and
that
partly
explains
why
at
age
55
he
just
registered
to
vote
for
the
first
time
a
month
ago
the
other
part
of
the
reason
is
sen
barack
obama
this
is
huge
battle
a
janitor
said
after
his
overnight
shift
cleaning
a
movie
theater
this
is
bigger
than
life
itself
when
i
was
coming
up
i
always
thought
they
put
in
who
they
wanted
to
put
in
i
didnt
think
my
vote
mattered
but
i
dont
think
that
anymore
across
the
country
black
men
and
women
like
battle
who
have
long
been
disaffected
apolitical
discouraged
or
just
plain
bored
with
politics
say
they
have
snapped
to
attention
this
year
according
to
dozens
of
interviews
conducted
in
the
last
several
days
in
six
states
over
and
again
firsttime
and
relatively
new
voters
far
past
the
legal
voting
age
said
they
were
inspired
by
the
singularity
of
the
2008
election
and
the
power
of
obamas
magnetism
many
also
said
they
were
loath
to
miss
out
on
their
part
in
writing
what
could
be
a
new
chapter
of
american
history

the
chance
to
vote
for
a
black
president
the
swelling
ranks
of
the
newly
enthusiastic
are
also
the
result
of
extensive
nationwide
voter
registration
drives
and
new
earlyvoting
procedures
in
many
states
which
have
made
the
process
easier
and
more
accessible
for
some
black
men
and
women
the
sense
of
pride
is
overwhelming
as
is
the
feeling
that
they
are
participating
in
what
could
become
a
touchstone
moment
something
that
children
and
grandchildren
will
want
to
hear
about
id
feel
bad
forever
if
i
didnt
get
out
this
time
said
shandell
wilcox
29
of
jacksonville
fla
a
cafeteria
worker
id
feel
like
i
didnt
do
my
part
to
put
him
in
the
office
how
would
i
explain
that
to
my
little
girl
oh
i
had
something
better
to
do
and
sure
its
partially
because
hes
africanamerican
but
he
also
says
there
will
be
change
and
i
believe
him
on
msnbc
sen
barack
obamas
surge
in
the
polls
was
so
strong
he
was
competitive
in
mccains
home
state
arizona
the
everyman
hero
of
mccains
campaign
joe
the
plumber
failed
to
make
an
expected
appearance
at
a
morning
rally
in
defiance
ohio
and
the
senators
efforts
to
highlight
obamas
association
with
a
professor
tied
to
the
plo
were
amounting
to
nothing
wait
a
minute

not
so
fast
click
things
were
looking
up
for
mccain
the
fox
news
channel
hosts
sean
hannity
and
greta
van
susteren
told
their
viewers
at
roughly
the
same
time
thursday
he
got
a
boost
at
an
afternoon
rally
in
sandusky
ohio
from
none
other
than
joe
the
plumber
who
announced
his
intention
to
vote
for
a
real
american
john
mccain
he
was
gaining
new
ground
in
evertightening
polls
despite
the
overwhelming
bias
against
him
in
the
mainstream
news
media
and
obamas
association
with
a
professor
sympathetic
to
the
plo
was
now
at
the
center
of
the
election
on
any
given
night
there
are
two
distinctly
even
extremely
different
views
of
the
presidential
campaign
offered
on
two
of
the
three
big
cable
news
networks
fox
news
channel
and
msnbc
a
dual
reality
that
is
reflected
on
the
internet
as
well
on
one
polls
that
are
tightening
are
emphasized
over
those
that
are
not
and
the
rest
of
the
news
media
is
portrayed
as
papering
over
questions
about
obamas
past
associations
with
people
who
have
purportedly
antiamerican
tendencies
which
he
has
not
answered
i
feel
like
we
are
talking
to
the
germans
after
hitler
comes
to
power
saying
oh
well
i
didnt
know
ann
coulter
the
conservative
commentator
told
hannity
on
thursday
on
the
other
polls
that
show
tightening
are
largely
ignored
and
the
race
is
cast
as
one
between
an
angry
and
erratic
mccain
whose
desperate
misleading
campaign
has
as
low
as
a
4
percent
chance
of
beating
a
cool
confident
and
deserving
democratic
nominee
hes
been
a
good
father
a
good
citizen
hes
paid
attention
to
his
country
chris
matthews
the
msnbc
host
said
wednesday
night
in
addressing
those
who
might
be
leaning
against
obama
based
on
race
give
the
guy
a
break
and
think
about
voting
for
him
and
perhaps
unsurprisingly
each
campaign
is
often
at
war
against
its
television
antagonist
just
as
the
networks
are
at
war
with
each
other
many
of
the
mug
shots
of
drug
traffickers
that
appear
in
the
mexican
press
show
surlylooking
roughnecks
glaring
menacingly
at
the
camera
an
anticorruption
investigation
unveiled
last
week
in
the
mexican
capital
however
made
it
clear
that
not
everybody
enmeshed
in
the
narcotics
trade
looked
the
part
there
was
a
grayhaired
grandfatherly
type
who
was
pushing
70
as
well
as
an
avuncular
figure
with
a
neatly
styled
goatee
and
wirerimmed
spectacles
perched
upon
his
nose
some
of
the
five
men
who
found
themselves
on
their
way
to
jail
on
the
front
pages
of
newspapers
wore
suits
which
made
them
look
more
like
bureaucrats
than
bad
guys
among
the
greatest
challenges
in
mexicos
drug
war
is
the
fact
that
the
traffickers
fit
no
type
their
ranks
include
men
and
women
the
young
and
the
old
and
they
can
work
anywhere
in
remote
drug
labs
as
part
of
roving
assassination
squads
even
within
the
upper
reaches
of
the
government
it
has
long
been
known
that
drug
gangs
have
infiltrated
local
police
forces
now
it
is
becoming
ever
more
clear
that
the
problem
does
not
stop
there
the
alarming
reality
is
that
many
public
servants
in
mexico
are
serving
both
the
taxpayers
and
the
traffickers
the
men
in
suits
it
turns
out
were
both
bureaucrats
and
bad
guys
corrupt
officials
high
up
in
an
elite
unit
of
the
federal
attorney
generals
office
who
were
feeding
secret
information
to
the
feared
beltran
leyva
cartel
in
exchange
for
suitcases
full
of
cash
their
arrest
and
the
firing
of
35
other
suspect
lawenforcement
officials
represents
the
most
extensive
corruption
case
that
this
country
which
knows
corruption
all
too
well
has
ever
seen
and
it
raises
a
question
that
is
on
the
lips
of
many
mexicans
how
does
one
know
who
is
dirty
and
who
is
clean
im
convinced
that
to
stop
the
crime
we
first
have
to
get
it
out
of
our
own
house
president
felipe
calderon
who
has
made
fighting
trafficking
a
crucial
part
of
his
presidency
said
in
a
speech
tuesday
after
the
arrests
were
announced
that
house
is
clearly
dirty
there
is
ample
evidence
that
mexicans
of
all
walks
of
life
are
willing
to
join
the
drug
gangs
in
exchange
for
cash
including
the
farmers
who
abandon
traditional
crops
and
turn
to
growing
marijuana
and
the
accountants
who
hide
the
narcotraffickers
profits

this

it
does
seem
like
its
an

thats
just
too
steep
within
the

and
the

movement
the
recriminations
have
already
begun
for
reporters
and
editors
at
the
times
responsible
for
news
about
the
election

as
opposed
to
opinions
like
blows

this
is
a
tricky
time
they
have
to
walk
a
careful
line
reporting
what
appears
to
be
current
reality
without
predicting
an
outcome
that
nobody
can
be
certain
of
no
matter
what
polls
indicate
a
lot
is
at
stake
the
newspapers
credibility
and
voters
right
to
decide
the
winner
without
being
discouraged
by
coverage
suggesting
that
the
result
is
inevitable
the
times
and
other
news
media
got
burned
once
before
this
year
in
the
new
hampshire
primary
the
coverage
reflecting
respected
polls
and
what
reporters
thought
they
saw
on
the
ground
strongly
suggested
that
obama
fresh
from
victory
in
the
iowa
caucuses
was
going
to
defeat
hillary
clinton
the
times
published
a
frontpage
article
on
the
day
of
the
voting
that
reported
on
a
possible
shakeup
in
the
clinton
campaign
staff
and
quoted
an
unnamed
supporter
as
saying
were
all
resolved
to
the
probability
that
shes
not
going
to
win
new
hampshire
and
the
mood
has
turned
very
despondent

fatalistic
probably
two
days
later
the
newspaper
was
asking
how
pollsters
and
news
organizations
failed
to
see
the
clinton
victory
coming
now
times
editors
and
reporters
say
they
are
well
aware
of
the
danger
of
getting
too
far
in
front
of
events
still
i
think
the
coverage
over
time
has
created
a
strong
expectation
of
an
obama
victory
and
a
democratic
sweep
in
congress
if
it
does
not
happen
the
times
and
many
other
news
organizations
will
have
a
lot
of
explaining
to
do
the
expectation
has
been
built
bit
by
bit
in
the
times
an
online
video
about
the
fight
for
pennsylvania
that
briefly
mentioned
that
mccain
was
relying
on
christian
voters
and
then
dwelled
at
length
on
obamas
thorough
organizing
to
get
out
his
supporters
a
frontpage
article
about
the
risks
and
rewards
for
democrats
if
they
wind
up
controlling
both
the
white
house
and
congress
an
online
article
about
whether
sarah
palin
turned
out
to
be
a
drag
on
the
republican
ticket
that
one
said
mccain
might
still
win
but
anticipating
that
he
will
fall
short
the
prepostmortems

jill
abramson
the
managing
editor
for
news
said
it
is
difficult
even
when
you
do
the
most
diligent
editing
not
to
leave
the
appearance
of
calling
the
winner
she
said
editors
talk
daily
about
avoiding
stories
with
a
predictive
tone
or
premise
richard
stevenson
the
editor
in
charge
of
campaign
coverage
said
there
is
a
great
degree
of
angst
now
among
republicans
about
their
prospects
for
president
and
down
the
ballot
there
is
a
great
degree
of
optimism
among
democrats
that
all
leads
you
to
a
conclusion
right
now
as
a
snapshot
in
time
that
obama
is
in
a
better
position
than
mccain
is
in
thats
the
reality
and
were
not
going
to
put
our
finger
on
the
scale
to
pretend
otherwise
adam
nagourney
the
chief
political
correspondent
said
i
dont
think
its
over
and
i
think
coverage
that
suggests
it
is
is
irresponsible
still
he
said
youve
got
to
reflect
whats
going
on
whats
going
on
is
that
obama
is
ahead
in
every
national
poll
he
is
drawing
huge
crowds
and
raising
record
amounts
of
money
he
is
leading
or
tied
in
critical
states
that
mccain
must
win
to
have
any
chance
and
mccain
is
saddled
with
an
apparent
recession
an
unpopular
war
and
an
unpopular
president
from
his
party
none
of
which
means
he
cannot
win
nagourney
wrote
a
frontpage
article
on
oct
24
under
the
headline
in
mccains
uphill
battle
winning
is
an
option
that
explored
the
ways
the
republican
candidate
could
prevail
the
article
said
mccain
would
have
to
hold
republican
states
where
obama
has
him
on
the
run
and
either
convert
a
democratic
state
like
pennsylvania
or
pick
up
a
combination
of
swing
states
not
easy
but
not
impossible
either
it
said
the
latest
timescbs
news
poll
on
friday
giving
obama
an
11point
lead
among
likely
voters
nationally
indicated
that
mccain
had
a
long
way
to
go
but
presidential
elections
are
not
decided
by
the
national
popular
vote
they
are
won
state
by
state
and
polls
in
critical
states
have
varied
widely
at
least
10
surveys
of
pennsylvania
voters
were
released
last
week
showing
obamas
lead
anywhere
from
14
to
4
points
larry
harris
of
masondixon
polling
and
research
which
found
the
smallest
obama
margin
said
the
cake
has
not
been
baked
masondixon
has
found
similarly
close
margins
in
florida
virginia
and
other
crucial
states
though
polls
clearly
inform
the
coverage
the
times
has
treated
them
with
great
and
appropriate
caution
in
a
year
when
an
africanamerican
is
atop
one
ticket
for
the
first
time
and
the
outcome
could
depend
on
groups

the
young
minorities

that
traditionally
do
not
turn
out
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
i
have
no
idea
whos
going
to
win
said
janet
elder
the
editor
in
charge
of
polling
what
the
timescbs
poll
can
tell
you
is
what
was
on
the
minds
of
voters
and
nonvoters
on
the
days
we
called
them
there
are
only
two
days
left
until
the
next
president
is
elected
i
think
the
times
would
be
wise
in
the
words
of
my
former
colleague
tom
fiedler
dean
of
the
college
of
communication
at
boston
university
to
forgo
the
temptation
of
the
horse
race
and
focus
on
issues
and
what
the
candidates
are
saying
that
is
just
what
the
paper
did
thursday
with
articles
on
their
positions
on
student
loans
and
summarizing
their
final
stump
speeches
best
not
to
join
blow
on
his
limb
as
abramson
a
former
washington
bureau
chief
told
me
what
i
know
from
politics
is
anything
can
happen
for
the
last
two
decades
the
easiest
way
to
invoke
dovishness
in
israel
has
been
to
utter
the
words
yossi
beilin
the
politician
who
navigated
mutual
recognition
between
israel
and
the
palestine
liberation
organization
in
the
early
1990s
and
has
never
stopped
believing
beilin
has
a
unique
place
in
the
israeli
political
galaxy
admired
and
reviled
for
his
relentlessness
so
it
is
of
some
consequence
that
last
week
as
new
elections
were
announced
and
the
chances
of
a
yearend
palestinianisraeli
agreement
seemed
slim
to
nonexistent
beilin
revealed
that
he
was
leaving
parliament
20
years
after
he
was
first
elected
and
stepping
away
from
political
life
31
years
after
shimon
peres
named
him
the
labor
partys
spokesman
israels
political
landscape
has
changed
drastically
since
the
1970s
peres
now
the
countrys
ceremonial
president
and
beilin
a
member
of
the
declining
leftwing
meretz
party
have
both
abandoned
labor
whose
own
fortunes
have
been
sinking
steadily
still
beilins
decision
to
leave
public
life
and
set
up
a
private
company
offers
a
lens
through
which
to
view
israeli
politics
the
arc
of
his
career
describes
the
fortunes
of
peacemaking
he
said
last
week
that
he
was
leaving
in
triumph
since
his
support
for
an
end
to
occupation
of
palestinian
territories
and
the
creation
of
a
palestinian
state
once
radical
positions
are
today
mainstream
there
is
no
denying
that
shift
in
public
opinion
and
official
policy
but
it
is
impossible
not
to
see
the
move
also
as
a
defeat

of
beilins
understated
style
in
an
overheated
environment
and
of
his
goals
with
no
palestinian
state
on
the
horizon
most
successful
israeli
politicians
resemble
ariel
sharon

openshirted
men
with
strong
military
backgrounds
thick
fingers
and
quick
tempers
but
the
softvoiced
beilin
with
his
cross
gold
pens
and
carefully
knotted
ties
was
a
different
species
one
that
left
israelis
bemused
at
his
political
height
that
mattered
little
since
he
was
less
a
leader
of
the
people
than
a
leader
of
the
leaders
a
behindthescenes
actor
who
persuaded
prime
minister
yitzhak
rabin
in
1993
that
yasser
arafat
wanted
peace
that
feat
was
all
the
more
remarkable
because
as
beilin
noted
in
a
twohour
conversation
in
his
office
last
week
he
and
rabin
never
liked
each
other
it
is
a
tribute
to
beilin

to
his
powerful
intellect
and
keen
interpersonal
skills

that
despite
his
demure
style
and
lack
of
goodoldboy
credentials
his
political
fortunes
rose
remarkably
in
the
1990s
as
the
oslo
peace
process
that
he
set
in
motion
took
over
israeli
politics
in
the
labor
primaries
at
one
point
he
won
the
no
2
spot
twice
he
was
appointed
a
minister
for
a
while
if
you
wanted
to
know
what
was
next
on
israels
geopolitical
agenda
you
consulted
beilin
but
when
peacemaking
reached
a
dead
end
and
the
second
intifada
broke
out
in
late
2000
sending
israel
into
a
fury
of
suicide
bombings
and
fierce
military
counterattacks
that
killed
thousands
beilin
lost
his
sheen
he
was
accused
of
being
a
snakeoil
salesman
responsible
for
luring
israelis
into
the
false
belief
that
they
had
a
peace
partner
the
exotic
fellow
with
the
phd
and
attache
case
was
anathema
beilin
said
he
felt
betrayed
by
the
palestinians
but
that
israel
had
mishandled
things
as
well
he
argued
that
nothing
essential
about
the
situation
had
changed
that
a
deal
remained
possible
he
found
a
new
home
in
meretz
and
continued
his
work
but
he
never
recovered
his
place
in
public
life
even
after
negotiations
with
the
palestinians
again
took
center
stage
three
years
ago
the
new
kadima
party
of
sharon
and
ehud
olmert
came
to
power
and
its
outlook
today
seems
hard
to
distinguish
from
his

although
no
one
feels
a
need
to
give
him
credit
when
olmert
gave
a
departing
newspaper
interview
in
september
he
sounded
exactly
like
beilin
of
the
last
20
years
i
could
not
have
said
it
better
than
he
did
beilin
mused
last
week
i
told
him
that
sometimes
i
read
his
speeches
and
am
not
sure
that
i
didnt
write
them
but
even
beilin
recognizes
that
while
his
successors
may
sound
like
him
they
are
not
taking
his
advice
on
details
and
tactics
he
recoils
for
example
at
arguments
against
yielding
any
part
of
east
jerusalem
to
the
palestinians
israel
is
going
to
pay
a
crazy
price
because
it
is
not
ready
to
give
up
some
palestinian
neighborhoods
in
jerusalem
that
no
jew
has
ever
visited
he
said
yet
giving
up
on
that
means
giving
up
250000
palestinians
who
dont
want
to
live
under
israeli
sovereignty
he
sees
two
clocks
ticking
one
is
demographic
with
the
jewishpalestinian
ratio
in
israel
and
the
palestinian
areas
nearing
5050
the
other
is
geopolitical
what
he
calls
the
growing
threats
and
hatred
toward
israel
in
the
region
our
behavior
he
said
is
costing
us
a
huge
price
because
we
are
giving
the
fanatics
the
best
pretext
beilin
now
60
is
starting
an
israeli
version
of
kissinger
associates
and
says
he
plans
to
stay
involved
as
a
private
citizen
in
peace
efforts
even
as
he
promotes
businesses
across
the
israeliarab
divide
among
those
who
favor
peace
it
is
widely
feared
that
the
most
israel
will
ever
offer
the
palestinians
is
less
than
the
palestinians
will
ever
accept
still
beilin
argues
that
there
is
simply
no
other
choice
than
a
deal
he
notes
with
approval
that
security
cooperation
in
the
west
bank
between
israel
and
the
palestinians
is
growing
with
jordanian
and
american
help
he
argues
for
a
peace
accord
as
soon
as
possible
followed
by
a
ceasefire
with
hamas
in
gaza
despite
what
he
considers
its
vicious
ideology
he
says
he
fervently
hopes
for
a
victory
by
barack
obama

but
also
that
the
economic
and
other
crises
dont
overwhelm
the
new
administration
god
forbid
if
this
conflict
is
marginalized
he
said
if
we
are
marginalized
it
will
be
to
kill
each
other
beilins
colleagues
on
the
left
meanwhile
publicly
mourn
his
departure
and
worry
about
its
symbolism
but
also
recognize
that
it
reflects
reality

saw
the
promised
land

robert
jordan
is
a
leftwing
radical
or
was
modeled
after
several
of
them
he
palled
around
with
terrorists
or
at
least
people
whom
many
americans
of
his
era
and
beyond
so
thought
his
specialty
is
blowing

up

he
is
at

a

for
whom
the
bell
tolls
an
american
fighting
francos
fascists
in
the
spanish
civil
war
and
despite
his
radical
roots
hes
a
literary
sensation
during
this
election
season
sen
barack
obama
told
rolling
stone
that
hemingways
novel
published
in
1940
is
one
of
the
three
books
that
most
inspired
him
as
for
sen
john
mccain
few
men
real
or
fictional
have
influenced
him
as
much
as
jordan
mccain
begins
his
2002
book
worth
the
fighting
for
a
phrase
lifted
from
jordans
dying
soliloquy
with
an
extraordinary
paean

12

he

have
been

ever

even
in

i
knew

if

he
would

he
would
be
strong
he
would
be
tough
he
wouldnt
give
up
mccain
said
in
a
radio
interview
in
2002
and
robert
would
expect
me
to
do
the
same
thing
america
never
embraced
the
more
than
3000
of
its
sons
and
daughters

many
of
them
communists
and
more
than
half
of
whom
were
killed

who
fought
in
spain
between
1936
and
1938
rather
they
were
persecuted
subpoenaed
and
passed
over
for
jobs
when
they
came
home
as
late
as
1984
ronald
reagan
said
that
most
americans
still
believed
they
had
fought
on
the
wrong
side
the
few
veterans
of
that
fight
still
alive
remain
unapologetically
to
the
left
mccain
wont
find
many
votes
among
them
hes
the
very
antithesis
of
what
we
stood
for
said
mark
billings
a
mechanic
during
the
spanish
civil
war
who
now
lives
in
el
cerrito
calif
he
says
he
is
only
guardedly
optimistic
about
obama
how
is
it
then
that
the
radicals
literary
standin
appeals
to
two
mainstream
presidential
candidates
who
agree
on
little
else
well
take
an
author
who
was
politically
skeptical
commercially
savvy
and
damned
good
throw
in
a
movie
starring
gary
cooper
and
ingrid
bergman
add
ignorance
or
amnesia
garnish
with
the
passage
of
time
and
you
get
a
role
model
that
comfortably
serves
two
both
candidates
regard
themselves
as
paladins
of
democracy
and
would
be
reluctant
to
acknowledge
that
their
hero
might
have
been
a
communist
said
paul
preston
of
the
london
school
of
economics
an
authority
on
the
spanish
civil
war
james
benet
of
forestville
calif
who
drove
ambulances
in
spain
agreed
if
robert
jordan
were
alive
hed
be
way
to
the
left
of
those
guys
and
hed
be
a
lot
harder
for
them
to
admire
hemingway
never
revealed
on
whom
he
based
jordan
who
taught
spanish
at
the
university
of
montana
before
heading
to
spain
cecil
eby
of
the
university
of
michigan
proposed
robert
merriman
who
like
jordan
was
a
westerner
and
a
teacher
he
had
studied
economics
in
moscow
but
merriman
who
was
killed
in
1938
was
never
a
guerrilla
behind
enemy
lines
as
jordan
was
three
others
whom
veterans
speculate
could
have
been
models

michael
jimenez
william
aalto
and
irving
goff

were
in
fact
guerrillas
goff
a
new
yorker
who
died
in
1989
actually
blew
up
bridges
but
unlike
merriman
he
never
met
hemingway
he
once
joked
that
he
never
met
ingrid
bergman
either
if
he
had
he
said
i
might
still
be
there
large
swaths
of
jordan
including
his
red
black
blinding
temper
and
his
fathers
suicide
clearly
come
from
hemingway
himself
among
the
americans
in
what
later
became
known
as
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
few
claimed
to
be
jordans
prototype
most
hated
the
book
in
which
hemingway
trashed
the
people
leading
the
fight
for
the
embattled
spanish
republic
particularly
the
soviets
in
the
daily
worker
mike
gold
dismissed
hemingway
as
a
rich
alcoholic
voyeur
a
sportsman
and
a
tourist
the
book
represented
a
picture
so
drastically
mutilated
and
distorted
as
to
slander
the
cause
for
which
we
fought
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
declared
in
an
open
letter
to
hemingway
and
they
hated
robert
jordan
mostly
for
what
peter
carroll
author
of
the
odyssey
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
called
his
extreme
individualism
jordan
was
no
ideologue
nobody
owned
his
mind
nor
his
faculties
for
seeing
and
hearing
hemingway
wrote
when
jordan
dreams
of
marx
it
is
groucho
not
karl
he
fantasizes
about
taking
maria
to
see
a
night
at
the
opera
in
madrid
once
the
fighting
stops
allen
josephs
a
hemingway
scholar
at
the
university
of
west
florida
says
hemingway
created
jordan
as
a
communist
but
changed
his
affiliation
to
antifascist
after
his
publisher
charles
scribner
objected
the
switch
fit
hemingways
own
politics
and
not
coincidentally
made
jordan
more
commercially
acceptable
so
too
surely
did
making
him
a
stately
westerner
rather
than
a
new
york
jew
as
so
many
of
the
americans
hemingway
encountered
in
spain
were
jordans

to
give
his
life
to
a
cause
greater
than
himself
would
appeal
to
anyone
from
mccains
military
background
said
william
braasch
watson
a
hemingway
scholar
and
retired
professor
of
history
at
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
and
that
appeal
watson
added
would
only
have
grown
in
hanoi
where
jordans
long
interior
monologues

questioning
himself
his
character
his
future

would
have
anticipated
mccains
experiences
watson
said
he
could
see
jordans
appeal
to
obama
too
like
jordan
obamas
a
person
with
a
mission
and
a
larger
vision
he
said
he
too
seems
remarkably
selfcontained

somewhat
aloof
even

and
hes
driven
to
accomplish
his
goal
if
mccain
does
not
win
on
election
day
he
may
have
even
more
reason
to
identify
with
robert
jordan
part
of
what
jordan
has
taught
him
mccain
has
said
is
to
accept
your
fate
accept
your
fate
but
no
matter
who
prevails
come
tuesday
one
winner
is
already
clear
the
muchoutoffashion
hemingway
himself
in
the
politicalliterary
world
hes
this
years
comeback
kid
place
an
opponent
in
his
path
and
stephon
marbury
will
skip
past
him
place
an
entire
defense
in
front
of
him
and
marbury
will
find
a
seam
to
the
basket
from
his
earliest
days
as
a
basketball
prodigy
in
coney
island
marbury
has
been
able
to
dribble
pass
or
shoot
his
way
out
of
any
problem
on
the
court
yet
marbury
finds
his
career
at
a
crossroads
and
he
is
missing
the
most
vital
tool
in
a
troubled
athletes
arsenal
an
agent
marbury
has
not
employed
one
in
eight
years
and
it
is
probably
hurting
his
ability
to
break
free
of
the
knicks
and
start
fresh
that
is
at
least
the
view
of
a
number
of
agents
surveyed
last
week
and
it
is
shared
by
many
nba
team
executives
who
are
used
to
resolving
player
conflicts
by
working
through
their
paid
advocates
you
need
someone
who
is
looking
out
for
your
interests
but
is
also
assessing
your
situation
on
multiple
levels
from
your
perspective
said
lon
babby
a
washingtonbased
nba
agent
whose
clients
include
tim
duncan
grant
hill
and
ray
allen
sometimes
you
lose
the
forest
for
the
trees
if
you
dont
have
someone
who
can
step
back
and
analyze
things
with
some
distance
and
perspective
babby
is
not
privy
to
marburys
situation
and
was
speaking
generally
about
the
business
but
he
is
well
versed
in
the
sort
of
playerteam
standoff
that
now
threatens
marburys
career
the
knicks
no
longer
want
marbury
around
coach
mike
dantoni
placed
him
on
the
inactive
list
on
friday
night
and
marbury
has
most
likely
played
his
last
game
in
a
knicks
uniform
yet
he
remains
on
the
roster
because
of
a
practically
untradeable
contract
and
his
refusal
to
negotiate
a
buyout
marbury
is
set
to
earn
219
million
this
season
the
last
year
of
his
deal
such
stalemates
are
not
uncommon
in
the
nba
the
typical
solution
has
the
parties
agree
to
a
slightly
reduced
payout
on
the
premise
that
the
player
will
recoup
the
loss
when
he
signs
with
another
team
often
the
players
agent
has
suitors
lined
up
and
concrete
offers
in
hand
but
marbury
has
not
had
a
certified
player
agent
since
june
2000
when
he
parted
ways
with
david
falk
falk
said
he
resigned
marbury
said
he
fired
him
marbury
has
a
rocky
history
with
agents
he
fired
his
first
agent
eric
fleisher
in
1998
marbury
represented
himself
when
he
signed
his
last
contract
a
fouryear
76
million
extension
with
the
phoenix
suns
that
deal
was
consummated
in
october
2003
three
months
before
the
suns
traded
him
to
the
knicks
because
the
suns
offered
marbury
the
maximum
allowed
under
nba
rules
the
talks
were
fairly
simple
there
wasnt
no
need
for
me
to
use
an
agent
marbury
said
last
week
there
wasnt
no
need
for
me
to
give
somebody
4
percent
or
3
percent
of
my
money
when
i
can
go
do
the
same
thing
that
they
would
go
do
asked
if
he
needed
an
agent
now
to
help
him
find
a
new
team
marbury
said
i
dont
want
to
go
nowhere
i
want
to
stay
right
here
he
declined
to
say
whether
anyone
else
was
advising
him
and
would
not
answer
other
questions
on
the
matter
it
is
rare
for
players
to
represent
themselves
only
eight
current
nba
players
are
without
an
agent
according
to
a
database
compiled
by
draftexpresscom
the
group
includes
gilbert
arenas
who
negotiated
his
contract
with
the
washington
wizards
last
summer
money
matters
aside
marbury
needs
representation
for
some
practical
reasons
said
several
agents
speaking
anonymously
because
marbury
is
not
their
client
the
most
basic
reason
is
this
teams
that
want
to
sign
marbury
have
no
one
to
call
to
gauge
his
interest
a
good
agent
would
know
which
teams
need
a
veteran
point
guard
and
what
they
are
willing
to
pay
with
the
knicks
permission
the
agent
could
solicit
tentative
offers
before
negotiating
a
buyout

or
even
attempt
to
broker
a
trade
perhaps
most
critically
an
agent
could
convince
marbury
that
accepting
less
money
now
is
in
his
best
interest
because
he
can
recoup
the
loss
next
summer
as
a
free
agent
in
general
players
are
poor
judges
of
their
value
sometimes
overestimating
and
sometimes
underestimating
it
two
agents
invoked
the
adage
that
a
man
who
represents
himself
has
a
fool
for
a
client
hes
trying
to
answer
all
the
questions
for
himself
and
he
has
no
sounding
board
a
west
coastbased
agent
said
if
marbury
stands
firm
refuses
a
buyout
and
sits
on
the
bench
all
season
his
market
value
can
only
decline
the
agents
said
marbury
turns
32
in
february
he
has
not
played
a
full
season
since
200405
and
he
has
a
history
of
clashing
with
coaches
and
teammates
you
tell
him
theres
no
future
in
new
york
for
you
an
east
coastbased
agent
said
you
have
two
choices
you
can
buy
out
of
the
contract
and
go
somewhere
else
and
get
a
fresh
start
or
you
can
be
stubborn
and
sit
at
home
and
tell
people
how
great
you
were
in
the
90s
the
absence
of
a
paid
advocate
certainly
hurt
marbury
in
past
skirmishes
with
knicks
management
last
year
marbury
abandoned
the
team
during
a
trip
after
isiah
thomas
then
the
coach
threatened
to
bench
him
marbury
was
docked
one
games
pay
he
filed
a
grievance
with
the
help
of
the
players
union
claiming
that
thomas
gave
him
permission
to
leave
an
agent
might
have
advised
marbury
to
stay
put
while
trying
to
resolve
the
dispute
a
more
aggressive
agent
might
have
immediately
demanded
a
trade
or
a
buyout
agents
also
advise
players
on
personal
finance
business
investments
charity
work
and
medical
issues
most
have
strong
relationships
with
general
managers
and
know
how
to
sell
them
a
difficult
player
agents
also
help
make
their
clients
cases
to
the
news
media
more
than
anything
an
agent
serves
as
a
slightly
detached
adviser
who
can
keep
a
player
focused
on
the
bigger
picture
but
the
advice
is
valuable
only
if
the
player
listens
sometimes
the
east
coast
agent
said
you
have
to
tell
the
client
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
on
tuesday
the
nations
fretful
hopeful
voters
will
finally
have
their
say
and
none
of
the
rigorously
calibrated
polls
or
demographically
incisive
analysts
out
there
can
tell
us
with
any
certainty
what
will
happen
will
one
candidate
win
by
millions
or
lose
by
thousands
if
there
is
a
clear
victor
will
he
be
the
first
black
american
ever
elected
to
the
presidency
or
the
oldest
american
ever
to
win
a
first
term
we
dont
need
to
know
the
answers
to
be
certain
of
this
much
no
matter
the
outcome
it
will
be
the
climax
of
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
presidential
elections
in
this
nations
232year
history
and
the
first
and
the
oldest
capture
only
some
of
what
has
made
it
so
remarkable
whether
judged
by
the
milestones
reached
the
paradigms
challenged
the
passions
stirred
or
simply
the
numbers

the
85
percent
of
americans
who
believe
the
country
is
on
the
wrong
track
or
the
recorddemolishing
640
million
fundraising
mark
that
barack
obama
passed
by
midoctober

the
election
of
2008
actually
warrants
the
sorts
of
adjectives
and
phrases
that
are
often
just
journalistic
tics
epochal
pivotal
historic
onceinalifetime
its
been
so
rich
with
precedent
and
incident

and
so
very
very
long

that
we
have
if
anything
undervalued
and
even
lost
sight
of
its
significance
at
times
in
these
final
hours
theres
some
sense
in
pausing
pulling
back
and
taking
the
broad
measure
of
a
contest
thats
sure
to
affect
not
only
this
countrys
civic
life
but
also
its
emotional
and
psychological
landscape
for
some
time
to
come
much
of
its
impact
boils
down
yes
to
race
and
gender
obama
and
hillary
rodham
clinton
and
sarah
palin
who
could
become
the
nations
first
female
vice
president
in
this
fiercely
waged
election
longstanding
barriers
were
challenged
and
toppled
at
times
to
the
seeming
surprise
of
the
person
doing
the
toppling
think
back
when
obama
took
the
stage
in
iowa
after
his
victory
in
the
states
caucuses
last
january
he
was
not
yet
the
favorite
for
the
democratic
nomination
and
he
was
a
long
way
from
becoming
the
generalelection
frontrunner
in
videotape
from
that
night
you
can
see
and
sense
an
astonishment
and
exhilaration

in
him
around
him

that
seem
almost
quaint
just
10
months
later
they
said
this
day
would
never
come
he
tells
a
euphoric
iowa
crowd
and
not
just
his
eyes
but
the
whole
of
him
twinkles
gleams
they
said
our
sights
were
set
too
high
while
hes
talking
specifically
about
himself
and
his
campaign
troops
its
impossible
not
to
hear
in
his
words
a
statement
about
all
minorities
in
america
for
whom
the
weekbyweek
monthbymonth
advance
of
his
candidacy
would
hold
an
especially
powerful
message
the
writer
tanehisi
coates
observed
that
as
obamas
quest
for
the
presidency
caught
fire
i
knew
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
it
would
be
a
good
year
to
be
black
consider
this
fact
the
most
famous
black
man
in
america
isnt
dribbling
a
ball
or
clutching
a
microphone
coates
continued
in
a
recent
essay
for
time
magazine
he
has
no
prison
record
he
has
not
built
a
career
on
fourletter
words
words
like
hope
change
and
progress
might
seem
like
naive
campaign
sloganeering
in
a
dark
age
coates
further
wrote
but
think
of
the
way
those
words
ring
for
a
people
whose
forebears
marched
into
billy
clubs
and
dogs
whose
ancestors
fled
north
by
starlight
feeling
the
moss
on
the
backs
of
trees
over
the
course
of
a
campaign
that
was
part
therapy
session
part
consciousnessraising
seminar
a
few
of
the
principal
players
took
on
meanings
much
much
larger
than
themselves
obama
and
clinton
became
vessels
for
the
aspirations
and
frustrations
of
entire
classes
of
aggrieved
americans
their
journeys
encouraged
the
airing
of
hurts
and
the
discussion
of
difficult
issues
in
philadelphia
in
march
obama
delivered
a
setpiece
speech
that
sought
to
do
nothing
less
than
explain
centuries
of
racial
enmity
and
move
americans
past
it
in
new
hampshire
in
january
clinton
welled
with
tears
that
became
catalysts
for
a
charged
examination
of
the
treatment
of
women
in
american
life
was
sexism
more
potent
than
racism
this
was
the
sort
of
impossible
question
raised
on
television
shows
and
in
newspapers
at
restaurant
counters
and
kitchen
tables
revolving
around
clinton
in
winter
and
spring
palin
in
summer
and
fall
for
many
of
clintons
supporters
she
was
everywoman
called
on
to
prove
her
toughness
without
wholly
abandoning
her
softness
asked
in
the
end
to
yield
once
more
to
an
ambitious
impatient
man
come
tuesday
will
these
supporters
be
haunted
anew
by
what
might
have
been
and
will
they
be
haunted
more
by
an
obama
victory
or
an
obama
defeat
how
will
some
younger
voters
react
if
mccain
prevails
or
some
older
ones
if
obama
does
in
recent
weeks
the
ire
and
ugly
catcalls
of
some
supporters
of
the
mccainpalin
ticket
have
suggested
a
division
in
this
election
that
goes
well
beyond
tax
policy
or
iraq
strategy
theres
more
generational
cultural
and
stylistic
difference
between
mccain
and
obama
ages
72
and
47
than
between
rivals
in
most
presidential
contests
over
the
last
halfcentury
bill
clinton
and
the
first
president
bush
were
three
years
closer
in
age
and
while
clintons
victory
marked
the
ascension
of
baby
boomers
obamas
election
would
be
emblematic
of
something
more
profound
that
the
multicultural
postracial
society
so
often
discussed
in
the
news
media
but
so
seldom
affirmed
in
public
life
was
now
literally
the
face
of
our
nation
clinton
was
fleetwood
mac
obama
is
indiaarie
candidates
in
many
past
presidential
contests
lacked
life
stories
as
compelling
as
those
of
obama
the
son
of
a
man
from
kenya
and
a
woman
from
kansas
and
mccain
who
endured
years
of
imprisonment
and
torture
in
vietnam
but
these
two
werent
the
only
vivid
characters
in
a
campaign
that
purely
as
narrative
proved
sensational
who
would
have
believed
at
its
start
that
mike
huckabee
was
going
to
outlast
rudy
giuliani
that
john
edwards
pledges
of
support
for
his
seriously
ill
wife
were
going
to
give
way
to
a
public
apology
for
infidelity
that
obama
would
choose
a
running
mate
who
once
described
him
in
terms
of
plausible
aspirants
to
the
white
house
as
the
first
mainstream
africanamerican
who
is
articulate
and
bright
and
clean
that
mccain
would
choose
a
running
mate
who
could
fielddress
a
moose
and
would
take
the
stage
at
the
republican
convention
with
a
pregnant
unwed
teenage
daughter
in
tow
perhaps
thats
one
reason
voters
paid
such
close
attention
in
any
case
the
2008
election
contradicted
any
and
all
claims
that
americans
were
alienated
from
politics
although
cable
news
was
supposed
to
be
moribund
programs
devoted
to
politics
got
some
of
their
best
ratings
in
years
saturday
night
live
sailed
temporarily
into
prime
time
on
the
winds
of
political
parody
an
average
of
about
345
million
viewers
a
night
tuned
into
the
republican
convention
versus
226
million
in
2004
for
the
democratic
convention
viewership
rose
to
an
average
of
302
million
from
204
million
four
years
ago
were
seeing
record
levels
of
interest
in
the
campaign
said
michael
p
mcdonald
a
senior
fellow
at
the
brookings
institution
and
an
associate
professor
at
george
mason
university
who
studies
voting
patterns
mcdonald
cited
evidence
like
new
voter
registration
and
responses
in
polls
that
asked
how
interested
in
the
election
voters
were
and
he
extrapolated
from
that
to
predict
turnout
of
64
percent
which
would
be
the
highest
since
1908
when
he
said
657
percent
of
those
americans
eligible
to
vote
did
he
said
that
just
under
64
percent
voted
in
the
kennedynixon
election
of
1960
adding
that
2008
turnout
could
top
that
one
of
the
most
striking
measures
of
voters
engagement
has
been
obamas
fundraising
built
in
large
measure
on
small
donations
made
over
the
internet
the
final
total
may
well
exceed
700
million
in
the
2004
election
the
presidential
candidates
combined
raised
684
million
before
their
conventions
after
which
president
bush
and
sen
john
f
kerry
took
public
financing
only
mccain
did
that
this
time
and
as
a
condition
has
had
to
limit
his
spending
between
the
convention
and
election
day
to
84
million
obama
broke
an
early
promise
to
take
public
financing
and
thus
evaded
such
limits
he
spent
21
million
on
television
advertising
alone
during
one
week
in
october
if
obama
wins
by
a
wide
margin
on
tuesday
that
victory
will
reflect
more
than
strides
in
race
relations
thirst
for
change
and
the
strength
of
his
appeal
it
will
also
reflect
the
power
of
money
and
it
could
usher
in
the
end
of
generalelection
candidates
participating
in
the
public
financing
system
an
obama
victory
could
redraw
the
political
map
patches
of
red
becoming
blue
or
at
least
purple
swaths
of
the
south
no
longer
conceded
to
republicans
from
the
start
so
many
other
assumptions
have
been
upended
already
a
black
man
with
an
exoticsounding
name
wasnt
supposed
to
flourish
in
an
overwhelmingly
white
state
like
iowa
but
obama
beat
edwards
and
clinton
there
by
8
percentage
points
someone
who
failed
to
win
democratic
primaries
in
new
hampshire
ohio
pennsylvania
california
new
york
and
new
jersey
wouldnt
seem
to
be
on
a
successful
path
to
the
democratic
nomination
but
obama
was
he
hasnt
fit
neatly
into
the
usual
paradigms
and
that
could
manifest
itself
in
some
way
in
tuesdays
voting

if
this
election
like
the
1980
race
between
president
jimmy
carter
and
ronald
reagan
will
reveal
some
new
political
dynamics
and
yield
some
new
political
alignments
are
we
still
the
centerright
country
weve
heard
so
much
about
over
the
last
decade
obamas
success
even
to
this
point
calls
that
into
question
just
as
mccains
triumph
in
the
republican
primaries
raises
doubts
about
the
putative
sway
of
religious
conservatives
within

and
beyond

his
party
the
2008
election
suggests
an
evolving
body
politic
not
a
palsied
one
then
again
its
hard
to
tell
because
what
may
ultimately
be
most
extraordinary
about
this
election
is
its
context
the
country
is
facing
what
is
widely
regarded
as
the
greatest
financial
crisis
since
the
depression
and
thats
not
just
electionseason
hyperbole
america
is
fighting
wars
in
both
iraq
and
afghanistan
and
its
claim
to
global
leadership
is
being
undercut
by
russia
which
defied
the
will
of
the
west
in
invading
georgia
last
summer
and
china
which
staged
an
olympics
that
was
the
envy
of
the
world
the
2008
presidential
election
stands
out
from
so
many
before
it
and
will
have
repercussions
for
so
many
after
it
because
its
a
decision
about
who
can
guide
us
through
the
worst
of
times
were
in
trouble
if
we
get
it
wrong
and
maybe
even
if
we
get
it
right
after
nearly
a
decade
of
running
marathons

19
races
that
add
up
to
4978
pounding
miles

catherine
ndereba
insists
there
is
one
thing
she
cannot
live
without
not
her
coach
not
her
agent
not
even
the
occasional
philly
cheese
steak
her
reward
for
training
90
to
100
miles
a
week
it
is
her
massage
therapist
when
i
was
younger
i
never
used
to
have
a
lot
of
fatigue
in
my
muscles

never
ndereba
36
said
recently
in
norristown
pa
her
training
base
in
the
united
states
but
now
if
i
dont
have
a
massage
at
least
twice
a
week
i
feel
like
i
cant
move
i
dont
feel
old
i
still
feel
like
im
in
my
20s
but
yes
sometimes
there
are
a
few
signs
that
my
body
doesnt
agree
ndereba
a
fourtime
winner
of
the
boston
marathon
and
twotime
olympic
silver
medalist
for
kenya
is
among
the
41
elite
women
in
the
field
for
sundays
new
york
city
marathon
and
many
of
them
have
probably
noticed
uncharacteristically
sore
muscles
or
creaky
joints
their
average
age
is
about
33
one
of
the
oldest
groups
of
elite
women
if
not
the
oldest
in
the
history
of
the
race
organizers
said
twothirds
are
30
or
older
including
the
favorites
paula
radcliffe
34
and
gete
wami
33
nearly
half
are
35
and
older
its
unusual
to
see
so
many
really
good
women
of
that
age
but
this
is
probably
a
fluke
that
they
are
all
so
good
at
once
mary
wittenberg
the
race
director
said
i
do
expect
to
see
a
changing
of
the
guard
because
we
are
probably
looking
at
the
end
of
a
superstar
generation
gete
paula
catherine
are
in
a
class
by
themselves
but
time
is
ticking
she
added
they
are
probably
getting
close
to
the
point
of
diminishing
returns
those
runners
are
not
pioneers
in
racing
marathons

and
often
winning

into
their
30s
at
that
age
many
distance
runners
are
in
their
prime
some
experts
say
because
their
bodies
are
accustomed
to
the
mileage
required
to
train
for
the
262mile
races
many
also
started
running
marathons
only
after
they
had
built
a
foundation
in
shorter
races
to
prevent
burnout
and
injuries
a
widespread
belief
is
that
elite
runners
have
a
limited
number
of
marathons
in
them
so
they
also
tend
to
use
their
time
in
competition
wisely
grete
waitz
was
35
in
1988
when
she
won
her
ninth
new
york
city
marathon
the
year
before
the
british
runner
priscilla
welch
was
a
seemingly
ancient
42
when
she
crossed
the
finish
line
first
this
year
in
beijing
constantina
tomescu
of
romania
won
the
olympic
marathon
at
38
in
september
irina
mikitenko
36
won
the
berlin
marathon
she
began
running
marathons
last
year
she
said
because
she
was
mentally
tough
enough
to
do
so
after
having
two
children
to
some
the
current
wave
of
older
women
succeeding
in
marathons
makes
sense
more
women
are
running
the
distance
these
days
they
say
so
more
they
are
training
at
a
higher
level
more
women
are
also
sticking
with
the
marathon
because
of
the
economic
incentive
said
ryan
lamppa
a
researcher
for
running
usa
a
nonprofit
organization
that
tracks
trends
in
distance
running
top
runners
like
radcliffe
and
her
peers
consistently
receive
sixfigures
appearance
fees
from
bigcity
marathons
agents
and
race
directors
said
so
a
hefty
payday
is
guaranteed
just
for
showing
up
and
finishing
five
of
the
women
in
sundays
field
have
made
at
least
1
million
in
prize
money
in
their
careers
according
to
the
association
of
road
racing
statisticians
the
top
10
women
sunday
will
also
receive
prize
money
first
place
is
worth
130000
of
the
301000
purse
second
place
65000
third
40000
fourth
25000
fifth
15000
and
so
on
down
to
1000
for
10th
place
in
addition
bonuses
ranging
from
5000
to
70000
are
paid
for
reaching
certain
time
standards
twenty
years
ago
though
the
total
womens
purse
in
the
new
york
city
marathon
was
134500
organizers
said
and
a
decade
ago
it
was
165000
if
the
sport
was
back
in
its
amateur
days
you
definitely
wouldnt
see
as
many
30plus
marathoners
than
you
do
now
lamppa
said
i
dont
think
theyre
staying
in
the
sport
purely
for
the
love
of
it
its
a
nice
gig
if
you
can
do
it
long
enough
but
you
know
its
a
painful
gig
too
to
make
a
decent
living
at
marathon
running
in
your
30s
and
40s
lamppa
added
athletes
must
remain
fast
enough
to
finish
in
the
top
10
that
could
be
a
challenge
for
an
aging
athlete
hirofumi
tanaka
an
exercise
researcher
at
the
university
of
texas
said
endurance
athletes
had
the
edge
over
sprinters
as
time
marched
on
he
said
sprinters
peaked
at
22
to
24
and
marathoners
peaked
at
28
to
31
some
marathoners
reach
peak
performance
around
35
he
added
the
trick
is
finding
the
way
to
extend
that
time
frame
highlevel
marathoners
should
be
able
to
do
so
said
vonda
wright
a
professor
of
orthopedics
at
the
university
of
pittsburgh
in
a
study
published
in
march
that
looked
at
male
and
female
american
masters
recordholders
in
distances
from
100
to
10000
meters
for
the
past
50
years
wright
said
she
found
less
than
a
1
percent
decline
per
year
in
performance
as
they
aged
from
30
to
50
the
slowtwitch
muscles
needed
in
endurance
sports
do
not
decline
significantly
until
athletes
reach
their
late
30s
or
early
40s
she
said
but
fasttwitch
muscles
that
sprinters
rely
on
begin
deteriorating
in
their
late
20s
and
early
30s
if
you
are
a
runner
in
your
30s
or
40s
its
really
a
sweet
spot
to
be
in
wright
said
youve
trained
longer
so
your
heart
works
more
efficiently
and
your
lungs
exchange
oxygen
more
efficiently
you
know
your
race
you
know
your
body
biology
might
not
have
taken
over
yet
so
you
dont
see
that
muscle
physiology
decline
that
would
prevent
them
from
being
amazing
that
decline
however
could
happen
any
day

and
there
is
no
telling
when
the
athlete
will
notice
it
waitz
one
of
the
best
female
marathoners
said
from
the
time
she
was
35
until
she
retired
at
38
she
could
sense
her
body
changing
the
end
sneaked
up
on
me
she
said
after
10
years
and
20
marathons
waitz
said
it
took
longer
to
recover
from
races
she
became
injured
more
easily
but
she
said
the
change
in
the
mental
aspect
of
the
marathon
not
the
physical
part
prompted
her
retirement
waitz
said
she
did
not
feel
as
hungry
to
win
as
she
once
had
partly
because
she
sensed
that
her
body
was
not
as
strong
i
always
say
that
there
are
two
ages
of
a
person
a
running
age
and
your
biological
age
she
said
so
after
all
those
marathons
i
was
old
as
a
runner
but
still
young
as
a
person
i
still
felt
fast
but
i
was
not
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
ndereba
a
marathoner
since
1999
said
she
had
no
idea
when
she
would
retire
now
why
would
i
quit
if
i
can
still
finish
in
the
top
five
ndereba
said
why
would
i
quit
when
there
are
people
out
there
so
many
people
who
would
want
to
run
like
catherine
but
they
cant
i
will
run
until
i
feel
i
cant
do
it
anymore
with
her
massage
therapist
she
said
she
still
feels
much
faster
and
stronger
than
she
did
at
26
when
she
made
her
marathon
debut
in
boston
ndereba
said
she
was
in
so
much
pain
after
finishing
sixth
in
that
race
that
she
needed
to
be
carted
off
in
a
wheelchair
so
now
i
dont
need
a
wheelchair
when
i
finish
she
said
with
a
smile
it
shows
that
im
only
getting
better
right
now
that
philadelphia
has
phulfilled
its
phantasies
its
time
for
sports
sympathizers
to
turn
their
bleeding
hearts
to
other
cities
cleveland
and
atlanta
to
name
two
during
the
world
series
the
story
line
was
as
much
about
philadelphia
as
it
was
about
the
phillies
who
had
not
won
it
since
1980
the
world
was
continually
reminded
that
phillys
teams
in
major
league
baseball
the
nfl
the
nba
and
the
nhl
had
not
won
a
championship
since
the
76ers
with
julius
erving
and
moses
malone
took
the
nba
title
in
1983
poor
philly
no
championships
over
that
quartercentury
but
nobody
in
cleveland
and
atlanta
was
feeling
sorry
for
all
those
philly
phans
the
indians
havent
won
the
world
series
since
1948
when
bob
feller
and
bob
lemon
were
in
their
rotation
the
browns
have
never
been
to
the
super
bowl
the
cavaliers
havent
won
the
nba
title
and
in
their
only
two
nhl
seasons
three
decades
ago
the
barons
finished
last
in
their
division
for
all
of
the
braves
15
division
titles
in
atlanta
they
won
only
one
world
series
in
1995
against
the
indians
the
falcons
havent
won
the
super
bowl
the
hawks
havent
captured
the
nba
championship
and
the
thrashers
havent
lifted
the
stanley
cup
before
the
super
bowl
era
the
browns
won
the
1964
nfl
championship
and
three
titles
in
the
1950s
when
paul
brown
was
their
coach
and
otto
graham
their
quarterback
they
also
swept
all
four
allamerica
football
conference
titles
the
indians
won
another
world
series
in
1920
in
atlanta
the
falcons
at
least
reached
the
super
bowl
once
but
lost
the
braves
got
to
the
world
series
four
other
times
but
lost
to
minnesota
once
toronto
once
and
the

the

of

as
well
as
the

five

have
emphasized
that

the

have
never

but
they
won
three
nfl
titles
in
the
50s
and
another
in

the

won

the

even
with

so
if
you
cried
a
river
for
philadelphia
either
the
delaware
or
the

you
now
may
want
to
empty
the
cuyahoga
in
cleveland
or
the
chattahoochee
in
atlanta
leave
it
to
jon
stewart
to
cut
to
the
chase
interviewing
sen
barack
obama
last
week
as
the
campaign
rolled
toward
its
conclusion
the
host
of
the
daily
show
observed
that
being
president
today
looks
considerably
less
appealing
than
when
obama
launched
his
candidacy
two
years
ago
is
there
a
sense
that
you
dont
want
this
stewart
asked
that
you
may
look
at
the
country
and
think
you
know
when
i
thought
i
was
going
to
get
this
it
was
a
relatively
new
car
now
look
at
it
obama
laughed
and
gave
an
earnest
answer
about
having
an
impact
but
did
not
really
address
the
larger
question
just
why
would
anyone
want
this
job
anyway
what
is
it
about
the
psyche
of
wouldbe
presidents
that
makes
them
wake
up
in
the
morning
and
think
it
would
be
gratifying
to
take
on
the
troubles
of
the
world
to
assume
responsibility
for
the
lives
of
300
million
americans
at
a
time
when
their
lives
are
so
precarious
and
particularly
now
in
this
moment
of
maximum
crisis
millions
are
in
danger
of
losing
their
homes
hundreds
of
thousands
have
lost
their
jobs
the
national
debt
is
skyrocketing
the
taliban
is
rampaging
through
afghanistan
pakistan
is
a
nucleararmed
shambles
the
country
is
still
at
war
in
iraq
and
trying
to
avoid
it
with
iran
and
north
korea
russia
has
invaded
a
neighbor
and
much
of
the
world
hates
us
this
is
an
unprecedented
mess
said
ted
sorensen
the
former
counselor
to
president
john
f
kennedy
by
many
measures
no
incoming
president
will
have
inherited
quite
such
a
sack
of
trouble
in
decades
yet
neither
obama
nor
sen
john
mccain
has
expressed
second
thoughts
you
have
to
not
only
have
a
sense
of
confidence
but
a
pretty
big
ego

you
have
to
almost
be
a
fanatic
sorensen
said
you
have
to
look
at
yourself
and
everybody
else
running
for
the
office
and
think
not
only
are
you
as
good
as
they
are
but
you
and
your
ideas
are
better
and
that
you
can
fix
what
nobody
else
can
fix
the
ambition
and
drive
that
propel
politicians
to
high
office
at
a
time
of
tribulations
may
convince
them
that
the
countrys
deep
problems
are
simply
successes
waiting
to
happen
part
of
selfconfidence
is
believing
you
have
special
gifts
and
how
selfish
of
you
not
to
use
them
to
full
capacity
said
alvin
s
felzenberg
a
university
of
pennsylvania
scholar
and
author
of
the
leaders
we
deserved
and
a
few
we
didnt
its
not
a
job
for
ordinary
mortals
it
may
have
been
fairer
in
the
middle
ages
to
have
them
walk
over
hot
coals
than
what
we
put
them
through
now
of
course
this
is
not
yet
the
hotcoals
part
of
the
program
for
two
more
days
obama
and
mccain
can
still
enjoy
the
affirmation
of
the
crowds
to
see
either
on
the
campaign
trail
last
week
surrounded
by
fans
proclaiming
everlasting
love
was
to
taste
the
elixir
of
adulation
that
attracts
politicians
to
the
presidency
even
now
thats
a
pretty
heavy
trip
said
jerrold
m
post
a
professor
of
political
psychology
at
george
washington
university
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
leaders
and
the
people
around
them
is
very
important
its
a
very
heady
experience
and
something
happens
when
you
become
president
yet
even
in
the
best
of
times
the
presidency
can
be
an
enormous
burden
every
american
soldier
killed
abroad
every
house
foreclosed
on
at
home
every
monster
storm
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
the
indian
ocean
ultimately
becomes
his
responsibility
increasingly
that
burden
has
come
to
define
the
job
as
much
as
the
glamour
parents
get
that
a
cnnopinion
research
corp
poll
in
2006
found
that
only
41
percent
of
mothers
and
fathers
would
want
their
child
to
grow
up
to
be
president
compared
with
58
percent
who
would
not
and
that
was
before
things
got
as
crazy
as
they
are
now
think
about
those
beforeandafter
pictures
of
presidents
leaving
office
lets
look
back
at
how
the
vast
majority
in
the
modern
era
have
left
the
white
house
president
kennedy
was
assassinated
lyndon
b
johnson
and
richard
m
nixon
were
driven
from
power
gerald
r
ford
jimmy
carter
and
george
hw
bush
were
repudiated
by
the
voters
bill
clinton
departed
after
his
most
intimate
personal
failings
were
excavated
for
public
examination
george
w
bush
is
leaving
as
the
most
unpopular
commander
in
chief
in
the
history
of
polling
perhaps
the
only
president
lately
who
left
office
reasonably
intact
was
ronald
reagan
who
recovered
from
the
irancontra
scandal
and
found
himself
revered
as
time
passed
the
thing
about
reagan
is
he
was
not
stuck
on
himself
said
david
m
abshire
a
special
counselor
to
reagan
and
now
the
president
of
the
center
for
the
study
of
the
presidency
he
was
not
an
ideologue
and
his
sense
of
humor
was
always
on
himself
in
dealing
with
him
i
was
never
dealing
with
a
big
ego
those
who
think
the
office
does
not
wear
down
presidents
do
not
see
them
with
their
guard
down
critics
consider
president
bush
immune
to
the
devastation
of
the
war
he
launched
but
he
has
met
privately
with
hundreds
of
relatives
of
slain
soldiers
many
of
whom
later
described
him
weeping
and
genuinely
anguished
by
their
pain
for
all
that
bush
still
has
that
gene
that
makes
presidents
want
to
be
president
even
in
dark
moments
he
told
aides
and
businesspeople
this
fall
that
if
the
financial
crisis
was
going
to
happen
he
was
glad
it
happened
on
his
watch
so
he
could
put
the
country
on
a
path
to
improvement
by
the
time
his
successor
takes
office
in
some
ways
obama
has
expressed
similar
sentiments
his
advisers
said
they
warn
him
every
day
that
he
may
be
winning
a
pile
of
manure
if
he
beats
mccain
on
tuesday
but
they
also
hope
that
things
are
so
bad
they
can
only
get
better
obamas
answer
to
stewart
suggested
that
he
sees
an
opportunity
for
an
ambitious
program
that
when
people
are
struggling
for
answers
they
are
less
resistant
to
change
i
actually
think
this
is
the
time
to
want
to
be
president
he
said
you
know
if
you
went
into
public
service
thinking
that
you
could
have
an
impact
now
is
the
time
where
you
can
have
an
impact
ultimately
felzenberg
said
the
motivation
may
come
down
to
posterity
every
president
sees
himself
on
mount
rushmore
maybe
you
have
enough
gumption
to
think
you
can
defy
the
gods
and
come
out
intact
he
said
i
guess
you
have
an
opportunity
for
immortality
people
like
me
still
talk
about
lincoln
and
jefferson
as
if
they
were
still
living
now
and
in
a
way
they
are
every
time
we
talk
about
them
we
bring
them
back
to
life
in
a
sign
that
highend
collectibles
may
withstand
the
economic
downturn
a
nearrecord
price
for
a
rare
postage
stamp
was
set
last
week
at
an
auction
in
new
york
city
a
pink
3cent
stamp
issued
in
1868
and
depicting
george
washington
was
bought
on
wednesday
by
an
anonymous
bidder
for
1035000
including
commission
stamps
of
this
design
are
common
and
usually
worth
only
a
few
dollars
but
what
made
this
one
worth
a
million
dollars
is
a
distinct
wafflelike
grill
pressed
into
the
back
of
the
stamp
as
part
of
a
shortlived
government
experiment
to
prevent
fraudulent
reuse
the
post
office
tried
out
various
sizes
of
grills
and
only
four
3cent
stamps
with
this
type
called
a
bgrill
by
collectors
are
known
to
exist
the
four
were
rediscovered
in
1969
on
a
single
envelope
from
a
letter
mailed
to
germany
the
stamp
is
one
of
the
keys
to
assembling
a
complete
collection
of
american
stamps
this
particular
example
last
sold
at
auction
in
1993
for
85000
another
of
the
four
sold
in
1998
for
155000
wednesdays
buyer
who
bid
by
telephone
was
described
by
the
auctioneer
only
as
a
longtime
serious
collector
who
is
most
likely
trying
to
complete
a
collection
last
week
15
of
the
88
university
of
north
texas
football
players
failed
a
test
for
recreational
or
socalled
street
drugs
the
unusual
part
of
this
story
is
that
the
secondyear
coach
todd
dodge
chose
to
have
his
entire
active
roster
tested
even
though
the
sun
belt
conference
and
ncaa
do
not
require
this
kind
of
testing
other
coaches
around
the
country
have
done
some
targeted
testing
but
a
wholesale
maneuver
like
this
is
rarely
done
and
almost
never
surfaces
as
it
has
at
the
university
in
denton
north
texas
08
entering
saturdays
game
at
western
kentucky
is
off
to
its
worst
start
ever
and
dodge
said
he
saw
the
inconsistent
performances
lack
of
focus
and
mood
swings
of
his
players
as
indications
that
his
team
might
have
a
problem
twentythree
years
of
coaching
had
given
me
pretty
good
intuition
about
consistency
and
inconsistency
dodge
said
in
a
telephone
interview
i
suspected
that
there
may
be
some
uses
of
marijuana
on
our
team
i
felt
that
we
may
have
one
or
two
that
have
really
got
a
problem
and
theyre
crying
out
for
help
and
we
may
have
another
dozen
or
so
that
are
just
starting
to
dibbledabble
in
the
stuff
dodge
said
he
also
felt
that
the
specter
of
testing
could
give
his
players
a
reason
to
say
no
at
the
next
party
they
go
to
the
15
who
tested
positive
will
continue
to
play
and
do
not
face
any
suspensions
they
will
be
randomly
tested
throughout
the
academic
year
and
are
required
to
attend
substanceabuse
counseling
testing
all
88
players
cost
the
university
roughly
2800
brett
vito
a
reporter
for
the
denton
recordchronicle
broke
the
story
which
is
based
on
university
records
obtained
through
the
freedom
of
information
act
according
to
the
article
the
testing
was
done
between
sept
24
and
oct
15
most
division
i
and
ii
athletic
programs
do
some
testing
for
recreational
drugs
but
such
testing
is
usually
done
on
a
small
sampling
of
the
programs
athletes
dodge
said
it
was
only
fair
that
he
tested
the
entire
team
i
didnt
want
them
saying
i
was
picking
on
this
certain
group
or
that
certain
group
or
youre
only
testing
guys
you
didnt
recruit
he
said
the
team
captain
casey
fitzgerald
a
senior
wide
receiver
said
his
coach
called
the
right
play
i
feel
it
was
a
big
step
for
dodge
he
said
by
phone
thursday
he
has
that
responsibility
its
good
to
know
he
was
looking
out
for
people
and
making
sure
if
there
was
a
problem
it
would
be
addressed
fitzgerald
led
the
nation
in
receptions
per
game
with
104
entering
saturdays
games
there
was
a
team
meeting
we
addressed
the
problem
and
the
publicity
that
we
received
he
said
we
just
reassured
each
other
that
were
all
in
it
together
were
going
to
put
this
behind
us
and
try
to
make
everything
good
there
have
been
cynical
reactions
to
the
decision
to
test
his
players
would
dodge
have
done
this
if
the
team
were
80
was
he
trying
to
imply
that
drug
use

not
coaching

was
the
reason
the
team
was
underperforming
my
charge
while
im
here
as
the
head
football
coach
is
to
help
this
football
program
and
this
football
team
reach
its
potential
dodge
said
were
not
close
to
doing
that
right
now
and
if
weve
got
a
bunch
of
em
that
are
smoking
dope
theres
no
way
we
can
get
there
dodge
did
the
right
thing
and
so
did
the
university
in
supporting
him
even
if
there
is
a
double
standard
in
that
most
students
can
use
street
drugs
without
fear
of
being
tested
by
their
university
it
is
very
different
for
athletes
said
the
university
president
gretchen
m
bataille
athletes
have
scholarships
and
they
sign
consent
forms
theyre
basically
recipients
of
100000
worth
of
scholarships
over
a
fouryear
period
with
that
comes
certain
responsibilities
the
consent
form
says
they
can
say
that
they
dont
want
to
be
tested
but
then
theyre
off
the
team
the
high
rate
of
use
among
north
texas
football
players
makes
it
clear
that
a
broader
drugtesting
net
needs
to
be
cast
the
ncaa
has
a
yearround
random
testing
program
for
all
divisions
i
and
ii
athletes
for
steroids
masking
agents
and
amphetamines
according
to
mary
e
wilfert
the
associate
director
of
educational
services
the
ncaa
tests
for
all
drugs

performance
enhancing
and
recreational

only
during
ncaa
championships
drug
testers
for
the
ncaa
just
happened
to
be
on
campus

randomly
testing
20
football
players
for
performanceenhancing
drugs

right
when
dodges
team
was
being
tested
for
moodaltering
drugs
like
marijuana
cocaine
and
methamphetamine
the
ncaa
does
not
mandate
that
its
member
institutions
or
conferences
test
for
drugs
that
are
not
considered
performanceenhancing
this
is
a
mistake
as
dodge
told
his
players
its
not
good
for
us
its
illegal
it
leads
to
worse
things
it
leads
to
incarceration
and
sometimes
it
leads
to
death
how
could
that
be
good
for
our
team
the
difference
between
the
highprofile
sports
teams
on
campus
and
almost
any
other
extracurricular
activity
is
the
public
nature
of
success
and
failure
wins
and
losses

and
how
much
money
and
acclaim
they
bring
to
the
university
the
frustration
of
losing
may
have
contributed
to
the
role
of
drug
use
at
north
texas
sometimes
that
triggers
that
waters
said
of
the
correlation
between
losing
and
recreational
drug
use
and
youve
got
to
be
prepared
whether
its
your
academic
counseling
center
or
whether
its
your
trainers
or
whether
its
your
assistant
coaches
youve
really
got
to
spend
some
additional
time
helping
these
kids
deal
with
the
frustration
winning
is
a
wonderful
thing
losing
is
a
terrible
thing
fitzgerald
said
the
frustration
of
losing
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
choices
that
are
made
away
from
football
it
all
just
boils
down
to
who
you
are
fitzgerald
said
you
can
do
anything
you
want
every
day
its
about
being
smart
and
making
the
right
decisions
north
texas
is
having
a
miserable
season
on
the
field
but
dodges
bold
move
to
hold
his
players
accountable
may
turn
out
in
the
long
run
to
be
his
programs
best
game
plan
theres
nothing
like
game
day
and
after
the
adventure
of
oxford
basketball
tryouts
i
couldnt
wait
to
play
in
a
real
game
that
sense
of
anticipation
was
only
heightened
by
the
trip
to
nottingham
for
our
season
opener
let
me
say
this
the
trip
made
me
miss
the
good
ol
days
when
i
went
to
games
by
bus
all
11
of
us
piled
into
two
european
cars
the
pregame
meal
was
on
the
road
and
consisted
of
a
variety
of
homemade
sandwiches
dan
altschuler
was
just
finishing
his
nutellaandpeanutbutter
special
when
duncan
england
one
of
the
local
students
on
the
team
said
look
its
sherwood
forest
the
americans
in
the
car
went
crazy
in
the
back
of
my
mind
i
was
thinking
if
were
passing
sherwood
forest
on
the
way
to
the
game
whats
waiting
for
us
at
the
gym
there
was
no
way
the
game
could
live
up
to
the
hype
there
was
no
royalty
in
the
crowd

or
even
any
crowd
at
all
and
no
men
in
tights
tried
to
redistribute
points
from
the
team
that
was
winning
to
the
team
that
was
losing
although
the
girl
working
the
scoreboard
tried
once
or
twice
after
the
jump
ball
the
game
was
surprisingly
familiar

made
even
more
so
by
the
presence
of
our
point
guard
jeff
miller
jeff
played
junior
varsity
for
princeton
hes
everything
i
came
to
expect
from
a
princeton
basketball
player
over
four
years
in
the
ivy
league
jeff
is
a
rhodes
scholar
who
has
the
need
to
stop
practice
every
time
anyone
makes
a
backdoor
cut
to
explain
the
proper
angle
toss
in
a
couple
of
princeton
oddities
like
his
insistence
to
shoot
layups
from
the
right
side
with
his
left
hand
and
vice
versa
and
you
have
the
prototypical
princeton
guard
i
never
miss
the
chance
to
give
jeff
a
hard
time
about
his
background
so
when
jeff
closed
out
the
game
with
a
wrongfoot
wronghand
wild
drive
that
drew
a
foul
i
didnt
greet
him
with
cheers
instead
he
heard
thats
so
princeton
his
free
throws
put
the
finishing
touches
on
our
9453
win
the
game
might
have
been
so
princeton
but
the
postgame
was
all
oxford
our
first
tradition
is
to
do
a
cheer
for
the
other
team
against
nottingham
it
was
a
simple
123
nottingham
but
coach
brian
porth
was
so
happy
to
get
his
first
win
that
i
almost
persuaded
him
to
let
us
chant
two
four
six
eight
who
do
we
appreciate
nottingham
nottingham
go
nottingham
the
postgame
cheers
were
nothing
compared
with
the
postgame
celebration
the
festivities
took
place
at
st
vincents
vinnies
is
pure
oxford
it
has
a
dress
code
and
pictures
of
old
students
all
over
the
walls
bill
bradleys
picture
is
front
and
center
by
the
bar
and
everyone
brags
that
he
is
a
better
athlete
than
bill
clinton
who
played
only
on
the
twos
basketball
during
his
rhodes
stint
st
vincents
is
old
school
at
lunchtime
it
is
an
allmale
eating
club
and
the
process
of
becoming
a
member
is
shrouded
in
mystery
you
have
to
be
invited
to
join
but
asking
how
you
receive
an
invitation
is
a
disqualifier
on
wednesday
nights
vinnies
becomes
the
postmatch
gathering
place
all
oxford
sports
play
on
wednesdays
teams
gather
there
for
the
drinks
the
bar
serves
the
appropriate
winter
ales
and
mixed
drinks
but
has
specials
called
pinkies
and
perkies
a
pinky
is
grapefruit
juice
orange
juice
and
five
shots
of
gin
a
perky
is
grapefruit
juice
lemonade
and
five
shots
of
vodka
i
can
attest
firsthand
that
perkies
have
the
power
to
turn
a
couple
of
postgame
drinks
into
an
illadvised
wednesday
night
at
the
euro
club
scene
the
only
problem
the
morning
after
the
nottingham
game
i
had
a
meeting
with
my
masters
supervisor
at
830
but
under
the
influence
of
a
few
perkies
and
buoyed
by
the
good
cheer
of
my
teammates
that
didnt
seem
like
such
an
impediment
my
education
about
english
basketball
continued
until
close
to
4
in
the
morning
i
may
be
only
one
game
in
but
i
have
learned
this
much
about
oxford
basketball
its
the
postgame
traditions
that
count
backdoor
cuts
and
layups
off
the
wrong
feet
may
be
so
princeton
but
too
many
perkies
and
two
hours
of
sleep
before
meeting
with
my
academic
adviser
thats
so
oxford
denver

democrat
barack
obama
has
solidified
his
base
and
picked
up
a
majority
of
unaffiliated
voters
in
colorado
giving
him
a
five
percentage
point
lead
over
republican
john
mccain
according
to
a
new
denver
post
poll
with
only
72
hours
remaining
in
the
presidential
campaign
the
results

in
addition
to
other
statewide
polls
showing
mccain
trailing
obama

indicates
that
the
arizona
senator
faces
substantial
challenges
in
winning
colorado
overall
obama
leads
mccain
49
percent
to
44
percent
colorado
unaffiliated
voters
the
critical
voting
bloc
making
up
more
than
onethird
of
the
electorate
are
backing
obama
57
percent
to
32
percent
four
percent
of
those
polled
however
are
still
undecided
in
a
denver
post
poll
one
month
ago
the
two
candidates
were
tied
with
8
percent
of
voters
undecided
since
then
obama
has
increased
his
lead
over
mccain
among
men
women
independents
and
voters
over
35
years
old
brad
coker
pollster
for
masondixon
polling
ampamp
research
who
conducted
the
poll
for
the
post
said
the
number
of
undecideds
in
colorado
is
smaller
than
in
other
battleground
states
while
those
voters
could
have
an
impact
especially
if
they
all
throw
their
weight
behind
mccain
obama
has
momentum
obama
looks
like
hes
in
good
shape
even
if
all
the
undecideds
break
to
mccain
obama
could
likely
still
hang
on
coker
said
mccain
spokesman
tom
kise
said
in
the
final
few
days
of
a
campaign
polls
are
all
over
the
board
the
only
poll
that
is
going
to
matter
is
the
one
on
election
day
he
said
in
these
last
96
hours

we
are
fully
confident
that
we
will
turn
our
people
out
and
colorado
will
be
a
red
state
on
election
day
in
the
past
44
years
the
state
has
voted
for
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
only
once
bill
clinton
in
1992
so
even
with
a
lead
the
obama
campaign
is
not
taking
the
state
for
granted
the
illinois
senator
attended
a
campaign
rally
in
pueblo
on
saturday
obama
campaign
manager
david
plouffe
said
he
thinks
independent
voters
in
colorado
will
continue
to
break
decisively
for
obama
in
colorado
and
nationally
plouffe
disputed
the
notion
that
undecided
voters
will
trend
en
masse
to
mccain
we
reject
that
90
percent
of
the
undecideds
will
go
for
mccain
plouffe
said
in
a
conference
call
friday
some
states
will
split
evenly
some
will
break
a
little
more
to
him
some
more
to
us
colorado
voters
as
those
in
the
rest
of
the
nation
overwhelmingly
cited
the
economy
as
the
most
important
national
issue
facing
the
country
and
obama
narrowly
edges
out
mccain
on
the
question
of
who
is
best
able
to
handle
economic
issues
he
also
is
ahead
of
mccain
on
environmental
and
publicland
issues
developing
energy
resources
and
improving
health
care
mccain
leads
on
immigration
national
security
cutting
taxes
and
managing
the
war
in
iraq
independent
voters
have
also
sided
strongly
with
the
campaign
of
democratic
senate
candidate
mark
udall
giving
him
a
small
but
stable
lead
in
the
race
for
colorados
open
senate
seat
the
poll
found
the
poll
indicates
that
both
candidates
are
getting
overwhelming
support
from
their
own
party
voters
with
udall
enjoying
a
19point
lead
among
independents
overall
udall
leads
republican
bob
schaffer
by
47
percent
to
43
percent
a
small
drop
from
the
fivepoint
lead
he
enjoyed
in
a
denver
post
poll
a
month
ago
and
one
that
shows
a
significantly
smaller
lead
for
udall
than
other
recent
polls
fourteen
percent
remain
undecided
in
the
senate
contest
the
poll
of
625
likely
voters
was
conducted
on
tuesday
and
wednesday
an
additional
200
unaffiliated
voters
were
also
interviewed
and
are
reflected
in
the
poll
which
has
a
margin
of
error
of
plus
or
minus
4
percentage
points
many
homeowners
who
have
taken
out
home
equity
lines
of
credit
have
learned
in
recent
months
that
these
loans
are
not
as
useful
as
they
initially
seemed
lenders
are
struggling
to
minimize
risk
and
because
they
are
especially
at
risk
to
lose
money
on
residential
real
estate
loans
they
are
cutting
back
on
homeowners
credit
lines
or
freezing
them
altogether
many
people
who
took
out
home
equity
credit
lines
of
100000
on
their
home
and
used
only
say
20000
have
received
letters
informing
them
they
can
no
longer
borrow
additional
money
just
as
their
stock
portfolios
are
dwindling
the
banks
reasoning
typically
is
that
area
property
values
are
dropping
so
the
equity
does
not
actually
exist
to
challenge
the
banks
valuation
of
a
home
a
homeowner
has
little
recourse
but
to
spend
his
or
her
own
money
to
order
an
appraisal

a
potentially
costly
and
futile
approach
but
a
new
countermeasure
is
emerging
take
out
the
money
before
the
bank
puts
it
out
of
reach
in
this
strategy
borrowers
draw
the
maximum
amount
even
if
they
dont
need
it
then
place
the
cash
in
a
liquid
and
safe
investment
vehicle
i
categorize
this
as
liquidity
protection
said
oded
benami
a
senior
loan
officer
with
the
sterling
national
mortgage
company
based
in
great
neck
ny
benami
said
he
had
suggested
to
mortgage
clients
that
they
consider
drawing
down
the
maximum
amount
possible
from
their
home
equity
credit
lines
which
leads
to
a
question
where
to
put
the
money
home
equity
credit
lines
usually
carry
interest
rates
equal
to
or
slightly
lower
than
the
prime
lending
rate
which
banks
charge
their
best
customers
last
week
that
rate
fell
to
4
percent
as
the
government
looked
to
stimulate
the
economy
those
who
withdraw
their
home
equity
should
consider
putting
the
cash
into
a
certificate
of
deposit
a
savings
account
or
a
moneymarket
account
benami
said
these
financial
instruments
are
typically
insured
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
borrowers
can
withdraw
the
money
on
short
notice
and
pay
no
penalties
in
the
case
of
savings
or
money
market
accounts
or
marginal
penalties
for
early
withdrawals
from
cds
unlike
money
market
accounts
money
market
funds
are
not
protected
if
the
depository
fails
shortterm
liquidity
is
a
key
advantage
as
borrowers
may
well
be
using
their
credit
lines
for
college
tuition
bills
or
as
emergency
funds
if
they
lose
a
job
or
face
a
major
home
repair
interest
rates
paid
by
cds
were
at
least
3
percent
last
month
benami
said
so
on
an
equity
line
of
100000
the
annual
cost
of
this
strategy
is
approximately
1000

the
difference
between
a
cost
of
4
percent
and
income
of
3
percent
he
said
the
question
then
is
is
it
worth
it
to
you
to
pay
1000
a
year
to
ensure
100000
worth
of
liquidity
against
the
worst
of
circumstances
for
many
people
the
answer
is
yes
there
are
some
risks
for
borrowers
who
follow
this
approach
first
if
the
value
of
a
home
drops
significantly
and
the
borrowers
have
spent
the
cash
from
their
equity
line
they
can
end
up
owing
more
money
than
their
property
is
worth
in
industry
parlance
the
borrower
is
then
under
water
or
upside
down
the
prospect
of
easy
money
is
also
a
temptation
that
some
borrowers
will
find
difficult
to
resist
but
for
those
with
enough
selfrestraint
not
to
spend
more
than
they
need
withdrawing
the
full
credit
line
may
be
easier
than
having
a
credit
line
rescinded
and
then
finding
another
bank
cc
sabathia
is
probably
going
to
be
a
rich
pitcher
with
a
west
coast
team
or
an
even
wealthier
pitcher
with
the
yankees
first
baseman
mark
teixeira
could
be
added
to
the
mix
in
the
american
league
east
where
the
orioles
the
yankees
and
the
red
sox
covet
him
or
he
could
remain
with
the
angels
outfielder
manny
ramirez
may
keep
hanging
out
in
mannywood
by
staying
with
the
dodgers
four
days

season

when
brad
lidge
fell
to
his
knees
after
guiding
the

to
their
first
world
series
championship

another
season
farcically
called
the
offseason

begin
monday
with
the
general
managers
meetings
in
dana
point
calif
although
free
agents
cannot
sign
with
new
teams
until
nov
14
there
has
been
endless
ruminating
about
where
sabathia
teixeira
and
ramirez
will
end
up
trade
discussions
will
also
intensify
because
pitcher
jake
peavy
of
the
san
diego
padres
and
outfielder
matt
holliday
of
the
colorado
rockies
are
among
those
who
could
be
dealt
although
sabathia
teixeira
and
ramirez
will
receive
the
most
attention
from
the
news
media
because
of
their
status
other
free
agents
can
have
an
impact
these
players
may
not
be
as
dominant
as
sabathia
as
polished
as
teixeira
or
as
fearsome
as
ramirez
but
they
range
from
talented
to
useful
to
fading
here
are
a
dozen
intriguing
free
agents
not
named

manny
or
texas
orlando
hudson
2b
he
is
a
threetime
gold
glove
winner
and
a
strong
influence
in
the
clubhouse
hudson
has
been
injuryprone
but
that
should
not
scare
teams
if
the
mets
ate
most
of
the
18
million
left
on
luis
castillos
contract
and
traded
him
they
could
sign
hudson
still
general
manager
omar
minaya
said
right
now
i
think
castillo
is
going
to
be
our
second
baseman
derek
lowe
p
the
durable
lowe
is
an
appealing
option
for
teams
that
do
not
sign
sabathia
lowe
has
averaged
15
victories
and
208
innings
in
the
last
seven
seasons
and
has
a
333
earned
run
average
in
the
postseason
if
the
huge
offer
the
yankees
will
undoubtedly
make
does
not
sway
sabathia
they
should
take
a
long
look
at
lowe
milton
bradley
dhof
the
good
news
is
he
hit
321
with
22
homers
and
77
runs
batted
in
this
year
the
bad
news
is
he
hit
68
points
higher
at
rangers
ballpark
in
arlington
than
on
the
road
he
has
averaged
just
90
games
a
season
for
the
last
four
years
and
he
is
always
a
threat
to
implode
aj
burnett
p
he
is
expected
to
opt
out
of
his
deal
with
the
blue
jays
and
pursue
another
loaded
contract
when
burnett
is
healthy
scouts
rave
about
his
repertory
he
was
healthy
enough
this
year
to
win
18
games
strike
out
231
and
toss
221
13
innings
all
career
highs
a
team
will
give
burnett
big
money
and
pray
that
he
holds
up
juan
cruz
p
how
much
could
the
mets
have
used
cruz
a
thinasafoulpole
righthander
when
they
were
playing
dialareliever
in
september
cruz
has
a
94mileperhour
fastball
and
struck
out
71
in
51
23
innings
he
is
not
a
closer
but
would
be
a
stellar
addition
to
help
revamp
any
bullpen
jason
giambi
dh1b
he
had
seven
adventurous
years
with
the
yankees
now
it
could
be
time
to
return
to
oakland
a
soft
landing
spot
for
giambi
he
should
be
able
to
crank
out
at
least
one
more
season
of
30
homers
and
a
375
onbase
percentage
raul
ibanez

he
has
knocked
in
338
runs
over
the
last
three
seasons

lowmaintenance
highproduction
player
ibanez
could
improve
a
lot
of
lineups
and
gain
some
acclaim
too
the
rays
the
cubs
and
the
mets
could
use
a
powerhitting
outfielder
jason
varitek
c
before
2008
he
probably
figured
he
might
match
jorge
posadas
54million
contract
not
anymore
while
scott
boras
variteks
agent
offers
him
to
the
tigers
and
others
varitek
should
probably
be
content
with
a
twoyear
contract
at
a
reduced
salary
from
the
red
sox
pedro
martinez
p
he
will
pitch
somewhere
most
likely
not
with
the
mets
martinez
would
be
smart
to
stay
in
the
national
league
where
his
87mph
fastball
will
not
be
so
wimpy
minaya
said
the
mets
would
talk
to
martinez
which
sounded
like
a
polite
goodbye
to
a
pitcher

a
561
era

driven
in
100
runs

more
for

straight

a
patient

has
decent
speed
the
yankees
like
him
but
he
will
be
35
in
march
and
his
statistics
are
slowly
declining
so
they
will
not
offer
him
a
threeyear
deal

some
team
will
joe
beimel
p
a
lefthanded
relief
specialist
he
has
allowed
one
homer
in
his
last
128
innings
barry
bonds
could
never
solve
beimel
why
should
anyone
else
beimel
will
not
command
a
pricey
deal
which
makes
him
even
more
attractive

he
missed
the
postseason
with
an
elbow
injury
and
has
averaged

150
innings

that
is
not
the
prescription
for
a
reliable
no

important
time
every
buyer
should
beware
the

about
to

jimmie
johnson
has
been
so
dominant
lately
that
he
could
wrap
up
his
third
straight
title
in
two
more
races
or
as
early
as
next
sunday
unfortunately
for

gray
there
are
three
races
left
in

gray
is

will
host
the
season
finale
on
nov
16
no
other
track
has
benefited
from
the
chase
for
the
sprint
cup
more
than
homestead
where
the
champion
has
been
determined
the
past
four
years
but
johnson
has
stormed
to
a
183point
lead
over
carl
edwards
heading
into

race
in
fort
worth
if
johnson
leads
by
at

161
points
after
the
nov
9
race
in
phoenix
he
will
win
the
title
no
matter
how
he
does
at
homestead
gray
said
friday
that
he
thought
that
homestead
would
sell
out
the
race
although
he
added
that
he
had
the
same
trouble
selling
tickets
that
track
officials
elsewhere
had
encountered
because
of
the
economic
downturn
the
attendance
at
atlanta
last
sunday
dropped
to
80000
from
100000
though
that
could
also
be
a
sign
of
diminishing
fan
interestits
not
the
best
scenario
for
us
he
said
obviously
wed
like
to
have
a
close
and
exciting
chase
like
weve
had
for
the
last
few
years
there
are
still
two
races
to
go
before
the
finale

646
laps
or
813
miles

so
there
is
time
for
johnson
to
run
into
mechanical
trouble
or
a
fenderbender
why
not
gray
said
laughing
before
quickly
adding
im
just
kidding
kurt
busch
beat
johnson
by
just
eight
points
for
the
first
chase
title
in
2004
four
drivers
had
a
chance
to
win
the
title
going
into
homestead
in
2005
five
drivers
were
in
contention
heading
into
the
final
race
in
2006
last
year
johnson
went
into
homestead
with
a
fourrace
winning
streak
but
a
surmountable
86point
lead
over
jeff
gordon
when
gordon
finished
fourth
johnsons
seventhplace
finish
was
good
enough
for
him
to
clinch
the
title
by
77
points
its
been
real
good
for
us
but
what
were
building
is
an
event
much
like
the
super
bowl
where
it
doesnt
matter
what
drivers
are
in
the
championship
race
when
they
get
here
gray
said
of
the
chase
at
this
point
in
the
history
of
the
super
bowl
it
doesnt
matter
whos
in
the
game
to
maintain
fan
interest
nascar
has
been
promoting
other
competitions
that
are
still
in
play
like
the
nationwide
series
the
rung
below
the
sprint
cup
and
the
manufacturers
championship
which
is
currently
led
by
chevrolet
but
johnson
has
been
so
fast
in
the
chase
with
five
topfive
finishes
in
seven
races
that
it
appears
as
if
he
will
cruise
to
his
third
straight
title
only
one
driver
has
won
three
straight
titles
in
nascars
highest
division
cale
yarborough
in
197678
johnsons
bid
to
match
yarborough
could
be
helped
by
the
locations
of
his
next
two
races
texas
motor
speedway
and
phoenix
international
raceway
johnson
has
finished
first
and
second
in
his
last
two
races
at
texas
and
has
won
his
last
two
races
at
phoenix
johnsons
most
impressive
performance
was
last
sunday
at
atlanta
when
he
took
four
fresh
tires
and
zoomed
to
2nd
place
from
11th
in
the
last
eight
laps
of
the
race
edwards
won
the
race
jimmies
the
last
guy
i
want
to
see
in
my
mirror
with
a
few
laps
to
go
edwards
said
during
a
conference
call
last
week
given
johnsons
dominance
other
drivers
have
been
asked
if
the
points
system
should
be
tweaked

again

to
ensure
that
all
36
races
of
the
season
are
meaningful
something
the
chase
was
supposed
to
have
addressed
i
think
you
could
throw
at
them
whatever
you
want
and
theyre
still
going
to
figure
out
how
to
win
it
matt
kenseth
said
referring
to
johnson
and
his
crew
chief
chad
knaus
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
this
years
race
at
homestead
could
merely
be
a
coronation
for
johnson
but
gray
said
that
might
not
be
such
a
bad
thing
because
johnson
was
poised
to
accomplish
something
that
no
driver
had
done
in
30
years
but
first
hes
got
to
get
through
two
more
races
gray
said
hes
got
a
long
way
to
go
it
happened
again
last
sunday
an
apparent
mistake
by
officials

this
time
it
was
a
muffed
punt
by
the
atlanta
falcons
that
did
not
look
muffed
after
all

probably
changed
the
course
of
a
game
from
there
what
has
become
a
familiar
postgame
ritual
unspooled
the
play
broadcast
repeatedly
in
slow
motion
all
over
the
country
arch
commentary
about
the
officials
competence
the
inevitable
note
from
the
falcons
sent
to
nfl
headquarters
asking
for
an
explanation
mike
pereira
the
leagues
director
of
officiating
always
has
a
full
inbox
from
irate
coaches
owners
and
fans
but
one
spectacularly
blown
call
by
ed
hochuli
the
nfls
highestprofile
official
has
opened
the
floodgates
to
an
unusual
level
of
scrutiny
and
scorn
from
coaches
and
players
in
the
first
half
of
the
season
and
with
each
excruciatingly
detailed
replay
or
gameturning
decision
there
have
been
at
least
three
obvious
ones
so
far
the
angry
chorus
has
grown
louder
creating
a
problem
for
the
nfl
the
statistics
show
that
officiating
is
no
worse
this
year
than
before
but
the
perception
that
there
are
more
bad
calls
resonates
according
to
the
nfls
grading
for
every
100
plays
9764
of
them
were
officiated
correctly
before
sundays
games
because
games
historically
average
a
little
more
than
150
plays
officials
are
averaging
about
four
mistakes
a
game
about
the
same
as
in
2007
when
the
accuracy
rate
was
9778
and
pereira
said
that
in
a
recent
game
he
would
not
say
which
one
a
crew
graded
perfectly

100
percent
correct
on
every
call
and
noncall
ive
never
seen
a
game
that
didnt
have
incomplete
passes
or
fumbles
or
interceptions
pereira
said
once
officiating
gets
in
the
public
eye
then
its
going
to
be
there
for
a
while
no
matter
if
its
better
than
in
the
past
or
worse
officiating
is
a
mental
exercise
that
involves
judgment
that
is
difficult
it
is
imperfect
the
former
baltimore
coach
brian
billick
who
is
now
an
analyst
for
fox
said
criticism
had
ratcheted
up
in
part
because
a
blown
call
leading
to
a
loss
could
result
in
a
coachs
firing
marcellus
wiley
a
former
player
who
now
works
for
espn
said
he
suspected
that
players
had
become
more
outspoken
as
they
had
received
more
guaranteed
money
but
billick
compared
the
officiating
controversies
to
fretting
over
injuries
when
a
star
quarterback
is
hurt
are
there
really
more
or
does
it
just
feel
that
way
one
time
there
was
a
hue
and
cry

this
is
the
worst
year
for
officiating

and
we
went
back
and
looked
and
we
determined
it
had
been
written
five
different
years
said
rich
mckay
the
falcons
president
and
a
member
of
the
nfls
competition
committee
which
oversees
rule
changes
since
we
brought
instant
replay
back
its
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
for
officiating
you
begin
to
scrutinize
plays
at
milliseconds
it
creates
an
unreasonable
and
unreal
standard
that
you
cant
meet
still
hochulis
call
in
the
second
week
of
the
season

he
ruled
that
denvers
jay
cutler
had
thrown
an
incomplete
pass
and
whistled
the
play
dead
negating
what
was
clearly
a
fumble
not
an
incompletion

almost
certainly
cost
san
diego
a
victory
and
it
gave
birth
to
nonstop
officiating
surveillance
when
hochulis
crew
waved
off
a
carolina
interception
return
for
a
touchdown
with
a
roughingthepasser
penalty
on
julius
peppers
there
was
instant
analysis
of
the
calls
accuracy
peppers
was
fined
10000
for
a
helmettohelmet
hit
on
that
play
then
miami
linebacker
joey
porter
angered
by
what
he
perceived
as
bad
calls
by
hochulis
crew
said
im
like
man
its
crazy
that
the
same
referee
staff
from
all
of
this
other
stuff
thats
been
happening
was
out
there
porter
like
other
players
and
coaches
who
have
sounded
off
was
fined
an
indication
of
the
nfls
distaste
for
questioning
the
integrity
of
the
officials

and
for
keeping
such
questions
in
the
public
eye
public
criticism
of
officials
is
prohibited
because
it
serves
the
club
and
the
league
no
good
said
ray
anderson
the
leagues
executive
vice
president
for
football
operations
we
do
it
privately
so
we
can
make
sure
were
responding
to
an
allegation
that
is
presented
in
a
calm
moment
not
in
the
heat
of
battle
where
you
have
just
lost
a
game
but
as
the
scrutiny
rippled
far
beyond
hochuli
kc
joyner
who
breaks
down
game
tape
for
his
annual
scientific
football
guides
and
his
web
site
the
football
scientist
said
he
wondered
if
the
harsh
glare
of
the
spotlight
could
be
affecting
officials
in
a
game
between
minnesota
and
detroit
a
lions
defender
was
called
for
pass
interference
although
replays
indicated
that
the
receiver
was
at
most
barely
touched
and
that
a
flag
should
not
have
been
thrown
the
42yard
penalty
put
the
vikings
in
fieldgoal
position
and
they
won
the
game
when
officials
took
at
least
five
minutes
to
sort
out
an
unusual
call
in
the
arizonadallas
game
a
few
weeks
ago

it
put
dallas
in
position
to
kick
a
tying
field
goal

joyner
became
convinced
that
officials
were
hesitant
to
make
mistakes
a
possibility
acknowledged
by
the
retired
official
jim
tunney
it
can
make
them
gunshy
and
its
very
important
to
work
with
the
crew
in
terms
of
confidence
when
they
walk
on
the
field
tunney
said
its
easy
for
officials
to
get
intimidated
and
in
todays
environment
they
have
to
keep
building
confidence
ive
been
afraid
in
situations
concerned
about
if
im
doing
the
right
thing
one
primary
argument
against
replay
mckay
said
was
that
officials
might
start
secondguessing
themselves
before
making
calls
because
mistakes
would
be
immediately
exposed
but
now
pereira
said
replay
forces
officials
to
improve
historically
33
percent
to
38
percent
of
calls
have
been
overturned
by
replay
he
said
in
the
first
third
of
this
season
he
said
only
19
percent
were
overturned
pereira
said
officials
had
improved
on
calling
sideline
catches
which
might
account
for
the
shift
but
there
is
little
thirst
for
more
calls
to
be
reviewable
the
competition
committee
will
probably
review
the
passfumble
rule
that
tripped
up
hochuli
although
pereira
and
anderson
have
reservations
about
changing
it
because
quarterbacks
could
be
endangered
as
players
pursue
what
may
or
may
not
be
a
fumble
but
there
is
almost
no
chance
that
pass
interference
will
be
reviewable
soon
now
there
are
11
stoppages
for
replay
a
game
if
the
replay
rules
were
broadened
the
average
could
rise
to
four
stoppages
pereira
said
i
think
were
all
happy
the
system
hasnt
been
too
intrusive
he
said
perhaps
so
even
if
it
is
not
perfect
in
the
meantime
pereiras
mailbox
fills
up
while
his
officials
try
to
tune
out
the
din
we
have
criticism
from
the
days
of
officiating
pop
warner
when
parents
yell
at
you
from
sidelines
pereira
said
i
dont
like
it
but
its
not
the
thing
i
focus
on
denver

democrat
barack
obama
has
solidified
his
base
and
picked
up
a
majority
of
unaffiliated
voters
in
colorado
giving
him
a
five
percentage
point
lead
over
republican
john
mccain
according
to
a
new
denver
post
poll
with
only
72
hours
remaining
in
the
presidential
campaign
the
results

in
addition
to
other
statewide
polls
showing
mccain
trailing
obama

indicates
that
the
arizona
senator
faces
substantial
challenges
in
winning
colorado
overall
obama
leads
mccain
49
percent
to
44
percent

up

four
percent
of
those
polled
however
are
still
undecided
in
a

month
ago
the
two
candidates
were
tied
with
8

said
the
number
of
undecideds
in
colorado
is
smaller

states
while
those

could
have
an
impact
especially
if
they

looks

said
in
the

few
days
of

polls
are
all
over

the

day
he
said
in

96

we
are
fully
confident
that
we
will
turn
our
people
out
and
colorado
will
be
a
red
state
on

past
44
years
the
state
has
voted
for
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
only
once
bill
clinton
in

so
even
with
a

the

is
not
taking

for
granted
the
illinois
senator
attended
a

rally
in

obama
campaign
manager
david
plouffe
said
he
thinks
independent
voters
in
colorado
will
continue
to
break
decisively
for
obama
in
colorado
and
nationally
plouffe
disputed
the
notion
that
undecided
voters
will
trend
en
masse
to
mccain
we
reject
that
90
percent
of
the
undecideds
will
go
for
mccain
plouffe
said
in
a
conference
call
friday
some
states
will
split
evenly
some
will
break
a
little
more
to
him
some
more
to
us
colorado
voters
as
those
in
the
rest
of
the
nation
overwhelmingly
cited
the
economy
as
the
most
important
national
issue
facing
the
country
and
obama
narrowly
edges
out
mccain
on
the
question
of
who
is
best
able
to
handle
economic
issues
he
also
is
ahead

thank
you
the
denver
post
the
nfls
crackdown
on
player
safety
has
produced
lots
of
penalties
big
fines
and
a
bit
of
confusion
according
to
the
nfl
it
levied
139
fines
for
playing
rules
violations
in
the
weeks
preceding
the
games
of
oct
26
that
it
said
was
up
marginally
from
last
year
many
of
those
fines
were
for
plays
that
did
not
draw
a
flag
during
the
game
although
according
to
footballoutsiderscom
which
tracks
penalties
calls
for
unnecessary
roughness
through
week
7
were
at
75
way
higher
than
last
years
43
do
the
afterthefact
fines
and
suspensions
undermine
the
officials
if
a
penalty
was
not
called
the
nfl
said
that
those
sanctions
did
not
you
cant
humanly
catch
all
the
things
that
might
happen
particularly
if
its
away
from
the
play
ray
anderson
the
nfls
executive
vice
president
for
football
operations
said
its
no
rap
on
the
officials
that
they
might
not
catch
a
helmettohelmet
hit
at
full
speed
on
the
other
side
of
the
field
the
nfl
also
uses
tape
of
hits
that
draw
fines
as
a
tool
to
teach
officials
what
kind
of
hits
it
wants
penalized
still
when
players
appeal
fines
or
suspensions
their
first
argument
is
obvious
how
can
it
draw
a
fine
if
a
flag
was
not
thrown
that
was
one
of
the
issues
anderson
addressed
when
he
met
with
members
of
the
pittsburgh
steelers
two
weeks
ago
after
several
steelers
players
publicly
questioned
the
emphasis
on
player
safety
safety
troy
polamalu
said
the
fines
for
hits

several
steelers
including
hines
ward
have
been
fined
for
hits
that
did
not
draw
flags

was
turning
the
nfl
into
a
pansy
league
we
understand
its
a
tough
aggressive
game
and
players
have
always
played
tough
anderson
said
he
told
the
steelers
to
the
extent
that
the
play
involves
illegal
techniques
or
hits
that
put
our
players
at
unnecessary
risk
this

and

the
second
kidnapping
of
a

afghan
in

in
the
past
two
months
a

for
the

ministry
in
kabul
said
saturday
the
man
zia
ulhaq
ahadi
a
businessman
and
the

of

anwarulhaq

was
abducted
near
his

on

morning
aziz

the
spokesman
said
the
afghan
consul
general
abdul
khaliq
farahi
was
kidnapped
in
the
same
area
in
september
and
was
reported
freed
a
week
later
kidnappings
have
increased
recently
in
peshawar
as
militants
have
grown
more
powerful
and
as
criminal
gangs
have
taken
advantage
of
the
deterioration
of
law
and
order
in
his
first
year
as
a
starting
running
back
michael
turner
of
the
atlanta
falcons
has
been
all
over
the
place
rushing
for
as
many
as
10
yards
a
carry
week
1
against
detroits
31stranked
rushing
defense
and
as
few
as
22
yards
a
carry
week
6
against
chicagos
sixthranked
rushing
defense
but
with
big
games
against
the
lions
kansas
city
and
green
bay
he
has
shown
that
he
has
the
ability
to
dominate
against
poor
defenses
playing
in
oakland
this
week
turner
will
be
running
against
a
raiders
defense
that
is
26th
against
the
run
and
has
allowed
the
secondmost
rushing
touchdowns
last
week
against
baltimore
oakland
allowed
192
yards
on
the
ground
with
four
backs
gaining
20
or
more
yards
even
accounting
for
his
inconsistency
turner
is
on
pace
for
1497
rushing
yards
and
14
touchdowns
it
is
unlikely
that
the
raiders
will
slow
that
pace
down
edge
to
jaguars
defense
in
a
game
between
a
team
that
cannot
stop
the
pass
rush
and
a
team
that
cannot
rush
the
passer
it
is
hard
to
determine
who
has
the
advantage
but
the
cincinnati
bengals
are
forced
to
start
quarterback
ryan
fitzpatrick
who
has
six
fumbles
and
five
interceptions
in
five
starts
and
has
been
sacked
17
times
even
the
jacksonville
jaguars
should
be
able
to
take
advantage
it
has
been
a
rough
season
for
the
jaguars
defense
which
is
ranked
23rd
in
the
nfl
in
total
defense
and
30th
in
sacks
with
nine
after
finishing
ninth
in
the
league
last
season
no
player
on
the
team
has
more
than
one
and
a
half
sacks
fitzpatrick
has
an
impressive
group
of
receivers
to
throw
to
but
he
has
yet
to
show
the
ability
to
get
the
ball
to
them
an
offensive
battle
in
denver
it
could
turn
into
quite
a
shootout
in
denver
when
jay
cutler
and
the
broncos
host
chad
pennington
and
the
miami
dolphins
cutler
has
been
great
at
home
this
season
with
1033
passing
yards
and
nine
touchdowns
in
four
games
pennington
has
been
hot
with
280
or
more
yards
in
three
consecutive
games
considering
that
each
team
has
struggled
against
the
pass
this
season
miami
is
ranked
25th
denver
28th
this
game
is
shaping
up
to
be
an
offensive
battle
responding
to
a
report
that
a
kenyan
relative
of
sen
barack
obama
was
living
in
the
united
states
illegally
his
campaign
on
saturday
said
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
her
immigration
status
and
that
any
and
all
appropriate
laws
should
be
followed
the
woman
zeituni
onyango
referred
to
as
auntie
zeituni
in
a
passage
in
obamas
memoir
applied
for
political
asylum
in
the
united
states
in
2004
but
a
federal
immigration
judge
rejected
her
request
and
instructed
her
to
leave
the
country
said
a
government
official
with
knowledge
of
the
case
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
because
of
its
sensitive
nature
onyangos
legal
status
was
first
reported
by
the
associated
press
on
friday
the
disclosure
came
as
the
presidential
campaign
hurtled
toward
election
day
on
tuesday
and
it
left
the
obama
campaign
answering
questions
about
what
he
knew
of
her
situation
some
democrats
suggested
that
the
timing
of
the
disclosure
could
have
been
politically
motivated
and
some
immigration
lawyers
said
that
for
government
officials
to
disclose
information
about
an
asylum
applicant
was
unethical
or
perhaps
illegal
people
are
suspicious
about
stories
that
surface
in
the
last
72
hours
of
a
national
campaign
and
i
think
theyre
going
to
put
it
in
that
context
david
axelrod
obamas
chief
strategist
told
reporters
on
saturday
sen
john
mccains
campaign
declined
to
comment
and
neither
mccain
nor
his
running

raised
the
issue
on
the

trail
kelly
nantel
a
spokeswoman
for

agency
said
that
the
matter
had
been
referred
to
the

nantel
said
that
she
could
not
comment
on
the

a

scott

said
the
white

had
no

in
the

onyango
is
the
halfsister
of
obamas
father
and
is
part
of
an
extensive
network
of
paternal
relatives
with
whom
obama
has
had
limited
contact
his
aides
said
obama
who
was
largely
raised
by
his
maternal
grandparents
in
honolulu
first
met
onyango
when
he
traveled
to
africa
as
an
adult
axelrod
said
that
obama
and
onyango
did
not
have
a
real
close
relationship
onyango
attended
the
ceremony
when
obama
was
sworn
in
to
the
us
senate
in
2004
but
campaign
officials
said
the
senator
had
provided
no
assistance
in
getting
her
a
tourist
visa
and
did
not
know
the
details
of
her
stay
at
the
time
of
the
ceremony
onyango
and
another
relative
said
in
interviews
that
they
had
flown
to
the
united
states
from
kenya
to
witness
the
moment
obama
last
heard
from
her
about
two
years
ago
when
she
called
to
say
she
was
in
boston
but
he
did
not
see
her
there

said
the
money
was
being
refunded
it
is
illegal
for
foreign

without

to

donations
aides
said
that
the
donations
came
through
the
normal
channels
and
that
no
one
at
the
campaign
knew
that
onyango
was
related
to
obama
or
of
her

status
the

on

that
onyango
lived
in
public

in

on
friday
the

reported
that
she
was
in
the
country
illegally
and
that
her
case
had
led
to
an
unusual
nationwide
directive
from

bristle
at

told
what
they

take

the
same
thing
nonprofit

do
at
no

this

was
caused
by
a
torrent
of
bad
loans
but
there
has
been
only
a
trickle
of
the
money
and
leadership
needed
from
washington
where
the

has
been
on
bailing

before

at

workshop
at
the
long

in
hauppauge
last

representatives
of

met

explore
ways
to
repair

so
that
families
can
keep
their
homes
for
the
life
of
the

and
not
simply
postpone
inevitable
foreclosures
the
emphasis
was
on
realism
and
honesty
in
a
world
that
jettisoned
both
participants
agreed
that
a
solution
as
big
as
the
problem
had
not
yet
been
devised
lenders
homeowners
and
advocates
are
stuck
with
straightening
out
a
colossal
mess
one
bad
loan
at
a
time
gone
missing
ever
since
sept
11
2001
the
world
has
shuddered
at
the
possibility
of
loose
nuclear
weapons
or
radioactive
material
falling
into
the
hands
of
terrorists
shuddered
and
done
too
little
to
stop
it
mohamed
elbaradei
the
head
of
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
warned
last
week
that
there
has
been
a
disturbingly
high
number
of
reports
of
missing
or
illegally
trafficked
nuclear
material
according
to
agency
figures
there
were
243
incidents
between
june
2007
and
june
of
this
year
fortunately
the
amounts
reported
missing
have
been
small
some
experts
say
that
if
all
the
material
were
lumped
together
it
would
not
be
enough
for
one
nuclear
weapon
that
is
no
consolation
in
a
world
where
so
many
countries
are
eager
to
build
their
own
nuclear
reactors
and
possibly
nuclear
weapons
that
means
that
in
coming
years
there
will
be
even
more
states
with
nuclear
materials
more
scientists
with
nuclear
knowledge
and
more
opportunities
for
terrorists
to
get
their
hands
on
the
material
for
a
bomb
it
is
the
atomic
agencys
job
to
keep
tabs
on
civilian
nuclear
programs
to
ensure
that
states
do
not
misplace
fuel
or
divert
it
to
clandestine
weapons
programs
one
way
to
guard
against
such
a
perilous
future
is
to
ensure
that
the
agency
is
fully
staffed
with
the
best
people
available
and
has
the
money
and
support
it
needs
member
states
must
be
willing
to
increase
their
budget
contributions
so
the
agency
can
refurbish
its
testing
laboratory
invest
in
new
technology
and
hire
additional
nuclear
experts
the
agency
must
also
be
ready
to
take
on
new
tasks
like
administering
a
nuclear
fuel
bank
to
be
the
supplier
of
last
resort
for
countries
that
choose
not
to
get
into
the
risky
reactor
fuel
business
producing
nuclear
fuel
is
the
hardest
part
of
building
a
nuclear
weapon
elbaradei
completes
his
term
at
the
end
of
2009
his
successor
must
be
knowledgeable
politically
skilled

but
less
likely
to
give
iran
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
at
crucial
moments

and
ready
to
help
lead
a
global
campaign
to
secure
dangerous
nuclear
materials
and
constrain
the

nuclear
appetites
president
bush
spent
far
too
much
energy
trying
to
oust
elbaradei
and
far
too
little
on

restraining
the

of
nuclear

barack

supporter
of
obama
a
lot
of
people
here
have
never
done
this
before
and
theyre
a
little
nervous
she
said
but
it
was
not
just
the
fear
of
making
cold
calls
that
was
making
her
guests
unsure
many
spoke
of
being
anxious
as
election
day
drew
closer
feeling
that
as
new
yorkers
their
votes
would
not
count
most
had
come
out
on
a
beautiful
sunday
to
try
to
do
something
to
swing
the
vote
in
the
states
that
matter
from
the
sputnik
bar
in
clinton
hill
brooklyn
to
the
bowery
hotel
in
the
east

in
harlem
supporters
of

gathered
across
the
city
they
made
inkind
donations
of
their
cell
phone
minutes
to
reach
out
to
voters
in
the
more
mottled
states
that
are
likely
to
decide
this
presidential
election
supporters
of
sen
john
mccain
held
a
similar
drive
at
the
campaigns
regional
headquarters
in
woodbridge
nj
a
40minute
drive
from
midtown
about
a
dozen
new
yorkers
most
of
them
from
staten
island
made
the
trip
last
weekend
according
to
stephanie
fila
the
volunteer
coordinator
on
monday
night
supporters
of
mccain
filled
the
phone
room
in
woodbridge
pounding
out
pennsylvania
and
new

area
codes
on

they
sat
close
together
at

a
large

small

leaders
for

decorated
the
walls
on
tuesday
nights
its
veterans
calling
veterans
and
i
come
to
that
too
said
jim
bellina
55
of
skillman
nj
who
served
in
the
navy
he
said
he
was
confident
despite
polls
showing
his
candidate
trailing
let
me
put
it
this
way
this
is
the
fourth
quarter
in
a
football
game
and
were
having
a
tough
time
but
if
you
know
senator
mccain
you
know
he
aint
got
no
quit
if
history
voting
registration
and
polls
are
any
indication
new
york
city
will
vote
democratic
in
tuesdays
presidential
election
as
it
has
every
time
since
1924
when
calvin
coolidge
a
republican
pulled
out
a
victory
in
a
threeway
race
that
saw
democratic
voters
siphoned
off
by
the
progressive
party
as
of
march
1
there
were
28
million
registered
democrats
in
the
city
compared
with
a
little
more
than
half
a
million
republicans
according
to
the
most
recent
numbers
from
the
board
of
elections
the
goal
for
strategists
of
both
parties
is
to
marshal
strong
supporters
here
to
change
minds
and
get
out
the
vote
in
swing
states
were
seeking
to
harness
the
enthusiasm
in
new
york
to
help
out
in
other
states
said
blake
zeff
the
director
of
communications
for
the
obama
campaign
in
new
york
more
than
3000
volunteers
made
roughly
180000
calls
last
weekend
according
to
statistics
provided
by
the
campaign
for
this
final
weekend
the
obama
campaign
said
it
would
be
ramping
up
its
last
call
for
change
effort
creating
a
handful
of
supersize
phone
banks
to
accommodate
hundreds
of
callers
in
addition
to
more
than
20
smaller
sites
in
woodbridge
where
more
than
200000
calls
have
been
made
for
mccain
they
will
be
hammering
away
until
election
day
according
to
the
campaign
new
york
supporters
of
mccain
however
will
not
find
any
official
phone
banks
in
the
city
though
they
might
happen
upon
the
candidate
himself
on
his
way
from
rockefeller
center
to
new
hampshire
on
sunday
morning
after
his
scheduled
appearance
on
saturday
night
live
the
campaign
is
likewise
encouraging
supporters
to
head
to
the
battleground
state
of
pennsylvania
to
knock
on
doors
with
the
end
nearing
the
emotions
of
voters
on
both
sides
seemed
to
be
gathering
strength
some
described
having
troubled
sleep
and
even
more
troubling
dreams
i
had
a
dream
the
other
night
that
obama
won
and
i
woke
up
so
happy
said
melissa
gluck
30
of
forest
hills
queens
who
came
with
a
friend
to
sibblies
house
to
make
calls
but
then
i
felt
a
sense
of
panic
at
a
much
larger
phone
event
for
obama
at
the
bowery
hotel
ralph
stern
83
also
said
he
had
lost
sleep
over
the
impending
election
i
get
a
little
shaky
he
said
making
calls
with
his
wife
arlene
at
a
wicker
table
in
the
lobby
i
get
panicky
jamie
lynn
27
a
waitress
and
college
student
who
lives
in
woodbridge
was
making
calls
on
behalf
of
mccain
she
said
that
for
three
nights
she
had
been
having
trouble
sleeping
nightmares
about
what
would
happen
if
obama
were
elected
in
her
dream
there
were
riots
she
said
she
had
been
making
calls
every
weekday
for
two
weeks
and
would
continue
until
the
election
no
one
seemed
nervous
about
making
dozens
of
cold
calls
to
strangers
in
faraway
towns
whats
the
worst
that
could
happen
said
edward
bishop
63
of
monroe
township
nj
they
hang
up
on
you
or
he
added
i
guess
they
could
say
theyre
voting
for
obama
after
eight
years
of
economic
policies
custommade
for
the
hedge
fund
set
it
is
great
to
hear
the
economic
interests
of
the
middle
class
mentioned
so
often
in
the
presidential
campaign
as
the
candidates
enthuse
about
all
they
intend
to
do
for
this
important
segment
of
american
society
it
would
be
helpful
if
they
also
specify
what
they
mean
by
middle
it
is
puzzling
when
barack
obama
suggests
a
tax
cut
for
a
middle
class
that
earns
all
the
way
up
to
200000
a
year
when
john
mccain
drew
the
border
between
the
middle
class
and
the
rich
at
5
million
a
year
it
brought
to
mind
marie
antoinettes
musings
about
dessert
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
straightforward
middle
the
nations
median
household
income
last
year
was
50233
half
of
all
households
earned
more
and
half
earned
less
some
economists
would
define
the
middle
class
as
those
who
earn
between
75
percent
and
125
percent
of
that

say
households
making
between
37500
and
63000
development
economists
sometimes
define
the
middle
class
as
those
making
more
than
the
bottom
fifth
of
the
population
but
less
than
the
top
fifth
in
this
country
that
would
include
households
making
between
20291
and
100000
of
course
there
are
places

new
york
comes
to
mind

where
150000
a
year
does
not
buy
many
of
the
trappings
of
wealth
the
heavy
use
of
the
term
seems
to
be
more
than
an
appeal
to
peoples
wallets
middle
class
has
become
less
a
position
on
the
income
scale
than
a
state
of
being
according
to
a
poll
by
the
pew
research
center
a
little
more
than
half
of
americans
consider
themselves
middle
class
including
a
third
of
those
who
make
more
than
150000
per
year
for
many
people
to
be
middle
class
is
to
work
hard
to
struggle
to
succeed
often
against
unfair
forces
forget
the
money
praising
and
promising
to
reward
the
middle
class
is
a
way
for
the
candidates
to
stroke
the
selfesteem
of
all
those
who
identify
themselves
as
good
hardworking
americans
and
this
makes
it
a
very
useful
term
mccain
hopes
heavy
use
of
the
term
inoculates
him
against
the
charge
that
he
is
carrying
water
for
the
same
moneyed
set
that
george
w
bush
does
obama
is
hoping
it
can
protect
him
from
charges
that
he
is
too
eager
to
redistribute
the
wealth
of
the
rich
and
those
who
hope
to
be
the
coded
language
also
has
real
costs
one
is
that
it
displaces
necessary
words
like
poverty
these
days
the
candidates
rarely
talk
about
the
poor
except
when
they
are
talking
about
the
risk
that
people
might
drop
out
of
the
middle
class
given
what
is
going
on
in
the
economy
that
fear
might
well
reach
up
to
200000
a
year
while
waiting
for
her
parents
outside
the
pro
shop
songhee
kim
took
her
sand
wedge
and
bounced
a
ball
off
the
toe
then
the
heel
after
a
dozen
bounces
kim
froze
the
ball
on
the
face
of
the
club
and
spun
it
as
if
she
were
a
chef
sauteing
it
by
the
time
the
ball
stopped
spinning
she
held
a
small
crowd
in
her
sway
this
was
how
kim
began
one
of
her
best
weeks
as
a
professional
by
entertaining
lpga
fans
last
month
at
the
samsung

20yearold
south
korean
in
second
place
one
stroke
behind
paula
creamer
and
panicstricken
about
speaking
to
american
reporters
kim
felt
enormous
pressure
to
conduct
her
news
conference
in
english
because
of
lpga
commissioner
carolyn
bivens
shortlived
proposal
that
foreignborn
players
with
two
years
experience
on
the
tour
be
proficient
in
english
or
face
suspension
beginning
in
2009
entertaining
answers
are
not
a
trick
kim
can
pull
out
of
her
bag
growing
up
in
south
korea
she
spent
countless
hours
addressing
a
golf
ball
but
rarely
an
audience
public
speaking
being
a
skill
that
is
not
encouraged
although
kim
speaks
english
well
enough
to
have
been
her
mothers
interpreter
during
the
tournament
she
opted
to
play
it
safe
she
spoke
in
korean
while
an
lpga
official
translated
and
another
chance
to
shine
a
light
on
a
tour
personality
was
lost
in
the
translation
although
language
has
become
a
primary
talking
point
on
the
tour
the
cultural
gap
may
be
wider
than
any
englishspeaking
policy
can
bridge
bivens
has
since
strained
relations
more
by
indicating
that
her
plan
was
also
meant
to
help
the
south
korean
players
shake
their
omnipresent
fathers
by
singling
out
the
south
koreans
bivens
has
reduced
them
to
onedimensional
stock
characters
which
is
like
reading
no
break
in
a
putt
on
a
contoured
green
walking
the
fairways
of
the
lpga
tour
for
two
weeks
one
finds
that
the
south
korean
players
are
an
eclectic
and
varied
lot
who
love
their
parents
facebook
and
pumpkin
pie
they
are
crazy
about
purses
texting
and
practicing
and
manage
to
balance
a
lot
of
complex
relationships
including
their
often
confused
feelings
about
golf
an
evolving
image
the
lpga
tour
is
the
longestrunning
and
most
successful
professional
womens
sports
organization
its
image
has
undergone
more
makeovers
in
its
58
years
of
existence
than
betty

from
dilettante
to

to
pinup
to

and
much
more
recently
to

120

up

this
year
on
the

the

the

comes
as
the

has
recently
lost
four
title
sponsors
and
has
yet
to
complete
a
television
deal
beyond
the
one
with
espn
and
the
golf
channel
that
expires
next
year
when
she
met
with
south
korean
players
in
august
bivens
said
she
had
received
complaints
from
corporate
sponsors
in
the
lucrative
proams
because
some
lpga
players
could
not
schmooze
in
english
after
the
details
of
her
languageproficiency
policy
were
leaked
the
public
outcry
was
louder
than
any
gallery
roar
within
two
weeks
the
lpga
announced
it
was
rescinding
the
threat
of
suspension
but
maintaining
its
expectation

through
its
program
of

and
software
programs

that
playing
members
would
become

english
bivenss
motivation
extends
beyond
the
fiscal
health
of
the
tour
in
a
recent
interview
she
said
her
goal
was
to
help
assimilate
the
south
korean
players
into
a
culture
starkly
different
from
their
own
and
to
emancipate
them
from
what
she
characterized
as
overbearing
fathers
forcing
the
players
to
learn
english
and
threatening
their
livelihoods
was
the
best
way
she
saw
to
accomplish
that
the
language
is
part
of
the
control
the
parents
have
over
their
young
daughters
bivens
said
if
they
dont
even
know

filial
obedience

are

said
there
were
a

on

however
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
just
like
in
any
other

one
has
to
go
and
reclaim
their
independence
learn
who
they
are
as
humans
in

of
their
own
volition
if
someone
is
not
ready
to
leave
the
comforts

they
havent
got
the
strength
to
do
it

feel

it
is
their

the
pressures
that
come
with
being
her
familys
chosen
one
i
really
appreciate
what
my
dad
is
doing
she
said
but
think
about
it
how
youd
feel
if
your
dad
retires
because
of
you
and
your
mom
is
lonely
because
of
you
i
dont
want
everything
to
be
about
me
her
father
who
explained
through
an
interpreter
that
he
travels
with
jang
because
his
presence
keeps
her
from
being
lazy
spoke
of
the
long
absences
from
his
wife
and
two
daughters
and
said
he
experienced
separation
anxiety
the
person
i
feel
most
sorry
for
is
my

he
said
id
like
to
apologize
to

they

han
said
all
the
players
are
the
same
they
practice
practice
practice
they
just
want
to
play
golf
harder
as
children
south
koreans
are
funneled
into
sports
or
schoolwork
the
two
do
not
mix
in
a
culture
that
places
a

on

yoo

is

for

this
kind
of
socializing
is
new
to
the
south
koreans
who
may
even
consider
it
improper
in
their

it
is
unusual
for

to

with

she

this

enraged
floridas

last

by
sending

out

won
and
that

resonated
as

this

ineptitude
saturday
the

will
be
whether

can
sneak
into
one
of

stafford
considered

best
quarterback
prospect

turned

hangover
begins
sunday
morning
a
federal
judge
has
appointed
a
temporary
receiver
for
a
kosher
meatpacking
company
in
iowa
after
a
bank
said
that
the

had
defaulted
on
a
35
million
loan
and
that
it
had
written
14
million
in
bad
checks
the

foreclosure
against

out
in

the

the
suit
says
agriprocessors
had
begun
to
fall
behind
on
the
revolving
loan
during
the
quarter
that
ended
march
31
suggesting
that
its
financial
woes
predated
the
raid
which
decimated
its
workforce
the
bank
asked
the
judge
to
appoint
a
receiver
immediately
saying

owed
188000
to
an
electrical
company
and

more
so
died
oct

in

he
was

los

where
he
had
taught
for
three
decades
in
nearly
20
books
and
scores
of
articles
boime
explored
the
social
and
political
contexts
in
which
art
is
produced
his
work
did
not
neglect
issues
of
style
and
form
the
traditional
province
of
art
criticism
but
it
focused
on
art
as
a
cultural
product

for
good
or
ill

of
the
society
in
which
it
is
made
he
also
sought
to
rehabilitate
one
of
the
most
famous
madmen
of
western
art
training
marxist
and
psychoanalytic
lenses
on
his
subjects
boime
examined
artworks
as
physical
manifestations
of
the
economics
class
divisions
power
structure
and
racial
attitudes
of
their
times
he
was
best
known
for
his
studies
of
19thcentury
european
art
but
his
work
ranged
over
many
genres
among
them
popular
imagery
in
europe
and
america
and
emblematic
national
monuments
like
the
statue
of

and

in

boime
offered
a
new
interpretation
of
a
wellknown
painting
by
a
wellknown
artist
with
a
planetarium
put
at

disposal
he
reconstructed

argued

the

outlandish

clarence
w
spangenberger

who
died
oct
21
in
rhinebeck
ny
at
the
age
of
102

was
the
last
president
of
what
for
many
years
with
its
more
than
60
vessels
was
the
largest
tugboat
company
in
the
united
states
and
maybe
the
biggest
in
the
world
his
death
was
announced
by
stuart
murray
author
of
thomas
cornell
and
the
cornell
steamboat
company
2001
by
the
time
spangenberger
took
over
the
legendary
company
in
1954
cornell
was
struggling
trucks
railroads
and
oceangoing
vessels
were
fast
cutting
into
its
business
spangenberger
known
as
bill
did
everything
he
could
to
stave
off
a
collapse
including
laying
off
hundreds
of
employees
many
of
whom
he
had
known
since
childhood

always
telling
them
in
person
he
even
had
to
let
his
father
the
company
barber
go
after
its
largest
customer
new
york
trap
rock
corp
a
producer
of
crushed
stone
bought
cornell
in
1958
spangenberger
remained
in
charge
of
towing
operations
which
continued
to
be
called
cornell
steamboat
but
his
economies
and
the
introduction
of
powerful
new
kinds
of
tugboats
were
not
enough
to
prevent
cornell
from
going
out
of
business
in
1963
the
company
traced
it
roots
to
the
1830s
when
thomas
cornell
acquired
a
sloop
to
carry
passengers
and
ship
goods
from
rondout
ny
a
port
town
on
the
hudson
that
is
now
part
of
kingston
to
new
york
city
100
miles
to
the
south
but
he
glimpsed
that
steamboats
were
the
wave
of
the
future
and
set
about
building
a
fleet
of
towing
paddlewheelers
that
by
1900
was
the
largest
of
its
kind
in
the
united
states
one
steamer
was
the
famous
norwich
which
was
designed
by
robert
fulton
and
operated
until
1910
cornells
business
empire
included
hotels
railroads
and
an
amusement
park
when
he
died
in
1890
samuel
d
coykendall
took
over
and
converted
the
cornell
fleet
to
propellerdriven
tugboats
his
six
sons
assumed
control
after
his
death
in
1913
spangenberger
was
born
in
kingston
on
dec
9
1905
he
was
the
only
child
of
parents
who
supported
themselves
by
catering
to
the
shipyard
workers
and
boatmen
in
rondout
his
mother
by
selling
bread
from
her
parents
bakery
and
his
father
by
working
as
a
barber
to
the
coykendall
family
and
to
company
executives
spangenberger
graduated
from
new
york
university
with
a
degree
in
business
then
worked
for
standard
oil
co
as
a
sales
representative
he
joined
cornell
in
1933
in
accounts
receivable
then
moved
to
supervising
the
engineers
firemen
and
oilers
of
the
tugs
before
climbing
the
ladder
to
become
president
in
1954
by
that
time
much
of
cornells
business
had
disappeared
the
hudson
had
been
deepened
around
1930
to
allow
oceangoing
ships
to
reach
albany
ending
the
need
to
tow
grain
barges
railroads
and
trucks
could
carry
most
cargo
faster
and
more
efficiently
than
boats
and
refrigeration
had
obviated
the
need
for
natural
ice
and
cornell
had
not
gone
after
the
lucrative
business
of
towing
petroleum
products
well
before
he
became
president
of
cornell
steamboat
spangenberger
had
nudged
the
companys
reluctant
owners
to
convert
steam
vessels
to
oil
power
his
efforts
to
modernize
the
fleet
resulted
in
boats
like
the
rockland
county
which
could
push
21
barges
that
were
tied
three
abreast
and
covered
an
acre
before
then
when
barges
were
towed
end
to
end
they
would
have
extended

whose
corporate
predecessors
dated
to
before

hoped
to
use
cornells
name
spangenbergers
expertise
and
4
million
in
new
barges
to
expand
its
tug
and
barge
business
but
when
sufficient
business
failed
to
materialize
trap
rock
sold
its
barges
and
boats
and
got
out
of
the
business
in
1963
spangenberger
who
left
no
immediate
survivors
liked
to
hike
in
the
catskills
and
dance
to
the
music
of
guy
lombardo
in
elegant
manhattan
hotels
with
his
wife
of
more
than
70
years
the
former
kathleen
m
sharp
who
died
last
year
he
played
tennis
into
his
early
90s
he
worked
to
keep
alive
the
memory
of
the
steamboat
company
he
helped
to
get
the
company
biography
published
and
to
organize
an
exhibit
about
cornell
steamboat
at
the
hudson
river
maritime
museum
in
2001
in
1958
spangenberger
with
clear
delight
showed
a
reporter
for
the
new
york
times
some
yellowed
articles
about
the
company
including
one
from
the
1880s
that
reported
that
it
had
cost
a
shipper
a
dime
a
ton
to
move
cargo
from
new
york
city
to
yonkers
and
twice
that
if
the
destination
was
poughkeepsie
super
bowl
champions
get
celebrity
treatment
for
amani
toomer
of
the
giants
this
meant
an
invitation
to
the
television
talk
show
the
view
such
moments
can
also
be
humbling
whoopi
goldberg
mistakenly
praised
toomer
for
the
spectacular
super
bowl
catch
that
was
made
by
david
tyree
but
toomer
let
the
gaffe
pass
so
as
not
to
embarrass
her
i
let
her
off
the
hook
he
said
in
a
way
the
moment
suited
the
understated
professional
persona
of
toomer
the
senior
giant
who
will
enter
sundays
game
against
the
dallas
cowboys
at
giants
stadium
with
several
franchise
passcatching
records
including
most
receptions
642
and
most
yards
9194
despite
his
longevity
and
accomplishments
toomer

in
his
13th
season

has
never
made
the
pro
bowl
it
was
not
until
this
season
that
he
was
elected
by
his
teammates
as
one
of
five
captains
i
havent
been
a
captain
since
high
school
because
im
kind
of
quiet
and
i
dont
really
say
too
much
toomer
said
i
thought
it
was
pretty
special
they
recognized
the
hard
work
ive
done
toomer
playing
a
position
occasionally
filled
by
outspoken
egotists
sometimes
comes
across
as
reticent
but
he
was
one
of
the
few
giants
to
publicly
discuss
the
recent
problems
involving
plaxico
burress
toomer
said
last
week
that
burress

suspended
for
a
game
earlier
this
season
and
benched
for
a
quarter
last
sunday

had
become
a
distraction
its
not
good
for
the
team
toomer
said
and
its
not
good
for
him
they
play
similar
roles
and
share
playing
time
so
the
situation
could
be
sensitive
toomer
said
he
did
not
confront
burress
but
he
felt
obligated
to
answer
questions
it
is
what
a
captain
does
as
is
usually
the
case
among
athletes
credibility
in
the
locker
room
is
earned
primarily
by
performance
on
the
field
toomer
accrued
more
last
sunday
in
pittsburgh
with
the
giants
trailing
by
5
points
in
the
fourth
quarter
on
a
fourthand6
play
with
a
move
around
a
cornerback
he
got
open
deep
with
a
lastmoment
dive
he
caught
eli
mannings
pass
for
a
30yard
gain
while
eluding
a
safetys
helmetfirst
tackle
the
reception
kept
alive
a
drive
that
helped
lead
to
a
2114
victory
kevin
gilbride
the
offensive
coordinator
said
the
catch
was
huge
somebody
had
to
step
up
and
make
a
big
play
he
said
gilbride
also
praised
toomer
for
the
courage
he
displays
two
days
later
on
his
day
off
toomer
was
in
a
limousine
in
hillsdale
nj
picking
up
chase
strynkowski
a
sixth
grader
at
george
white
middle
school
it
was
part
of
the
nfls
take
a
player
to
school
promotion
to
encourage
physical
fitness
toomer
ate
breakfast
with
strynkowskis
family
teased
chase
lightly
about
his
new
england
patriots
souvenirs
and
rode
with
him
to
school
in
the
limo
when
they
entered
the
principals
office
toomer
removed
his
hat
cant
wear
hats
in
school
toomer
said
my
dad
was
actually
the
principal
at
my
school
i
was
the
principals
son
think
about
that
that
was
in
northern
california
where
the
four
toomer
siblings
were
raised
in
a
suburban
neighborhood
with
a
view
of
the
golden
gate
bridge
his
parents
had
named
him
amani
askari
because
the
words
mean
peace
warrior
in
swahili
amani
first
attended
private
schools
but
his
father
donald
toomer
was
in
charge
of
an
innercity
junior
high
in
san
francisco
according
to
donald
he
decided
to
enroll
amani
in
his
school
when
his
son
said
to
him
at
a
young
age
dad
i
dont
like
black
dudes
i
said
what
donald
toomer
recalled
i
said
well
what
do
you
think
i
am
the
elder
toomer
speaking
in
a
telephone
interview
said
he
grew
up
as
one
of
13
children
in
what
he
called
a
ghetto
in
akron
ohio
he
said
his
mother
was
a
domestic
worker
the
elder
toomer
said
his
son
required
cultural
orientation
about
his
race
i
needed
him
to
go
to
a
public
school
an
innercity
school
to
see
how
other
people

people
of
color

had
to
act
and
react
he
said
i
wanted
him
to
understand
everyone
isnt
as
fortunate
donald
toomer
also
said
he
taught
his
son
to
be
more
aware
of
others
respect
yourself
and
go
out
of
your
way
to
be
aware
of
others
especially
the
little
kids
he
said
amani
excelled
at
his
fathers
junior
high
moved
on
to
a
private
high
school
was
recruited
by
michigan
and
was
drafted
by
the
giants
his
father
who
played
for
woody
hayes
at
ohio
state
used
to
officiate
pac10
games
and
still
operates
a
scoreboard
clock
for
oakland
raiders
games
so
he
had
connections
as
a
teenager
amani
toomer
studied
under
jerry
rice
the
star
of
the
san
francisco
49ers
but
he
had
difficult
adjustments
to
both
college
and
professional
football
in
his
freshman
year
at
michigan
he
called
his
father
and
said
he
wanted
to
transfer
he
said
dad
they
dont
like
me
donald
recalled
they
chased
me
out
of
the
varsity
room
in
his
rookie
year
with
the
giants
toomer
called
his
highschool
coach
on
the
telephone
and
said
coach
they
think
im
a
space
cadet
his
second
giants
coach
jim
fassel
scolded
him
for
poor
training
habits
toomer
got
more
serious
mastered
kung
fu
studied
yoga
and
evolved
into
something
more
than
a
kick
returner
now
he
mentors
players
like
mario
manningham
a
rookie
receiver
from
michigan
who
has
the
locker
next
to
toomers
he
has
been
showing
me
the
ropes
manningham
said
he
leads
by
example
down
the
row
the
secondyear
receiver
steve
smith
said
he
tells
you
to
stay
patient
your
times
going
to

smith
smiled
and
tapped
a
shelf
on
his
locker

smith
said

the
wood
in
this
room
toomer

34
years

manningham
is
22
smith
23
on
tuesday
toomer
stood
with
11year
old
chase
strynkowski
in
front
of
his
gym
class
in
northern
jersey
leading
stretches
and
exercises
and
telling
the
children
to
work
out
for
at
least
one
hour
each
day
be
active
toomer
said
dont
just
sit
around
and
play
the
xbox
live
a
healthy
life
having
just
finished
the
soft
part
of
their
schedule
the
jets
play
at
buffalo
on
sunday
in
their
most
important
game
since
they
lost
in
the
first
round
of
the
playoffs
in
2006
of
course
getting
the
jets
to
acknowledge
the
additional
importance
of
any
game
is
almost
impossible
a
violation
of
coach
eric
manginis
everygamecountsthesame
philosophy
yet
last
week
several
players
for
the
jets
43
used
the
word
big
to
describe
their
american
football
conference
east
game
against
the
bills
52
even
mangini
allowed
this
much
weve
definitely
talked
about
the
fact
that
if
you
want
to
move
forward
you
have
to
win
these
division
games
when
the
jets
made
deals
worth
more
than
100
million
in
the
offseason
on
free
agents
and
traded
for
quarterback
brett
favre
and
nose
tackle
kris
jenkins
they
did
so
with
the
intention
of
winning
games
like
this
one
seven
games
into
their
grand
roster
experiment
the
jets
still
have
no
idea
what
type
of
team
they
are
sometimes
their
running
game
is
effective
other
times
it
goes
nowhere
sometimes
their
passing
game
is
unstoppable
as
it
was
against
the
arizona
cardinals
when
favre
threw
six
touchdown
passes
other
times
it
is
erratic
as
it
was
in
the
jets
past
three
games
when
favre
threw
for
a
combined
seven
interceptions
and
three
touchdown
passes
in
those
games
the
jets
had
a
21
record
with
a
minus8
turnover
ratio
while
playing
against
the
cincinnati
bengals
the
oakland
raiders
and
the
kansas
city
chiefs
they
have
a
combined
417
record
the
defense
has
also
been
inconsistent
in
a
microcosm
of
their
season
the
jets
shut
out
the
cardinals
in
the
first
half
but
gave
up
35
points
in
the
second
despite
their
uneven
play
and
their
loss
to
the
raiders
the
jets
are
in
the
thick
of
the
east
race
trailing
the
division
leaders
buffalo
and
new
england
by
a
game
after
watching
the
bills
on
tape
favre
said
their
record
was
not
a
fluke
he
added
that
a
win
over
the
bills
would
give
the
jets
a
feeling
of
ok
we
could
be
pretty
good
it
will
do
a
lot
for
our
psyche
and
character
but
i
dont
know
if
it
will
put
us
over
the
hump
favre
said
we
have
to
get
over
that
hump
and
if
we
can
do
that
you
know
it
will
be
interesting
entering
this
season
bills
coach
dick
jauron
said
he
felt
each
team
in
the
east
had
improved
with
patriots
quarterback
tom
brady
out
for
the
season
that
improvement
means
the
division
is
wide
open

only
two
games
separate
the
bills
and
lastplace
miami
the
bills
lost
to
the
dolphins
last
week
jauron
acknowledged
that
each
week
coaches
say
they
prepare
the
same
way
but
he
added
that
a
division
game
with
the
playoff
implications
of
this
one
was
emotionally
a
little
bit
different
there
is
a
little
more
bounce
jauron
said
i
dont
know
how
else
to
define
it
its
not
in
terms
of
hours
of
preparation
or
effort
on
the
field
at
practice
there
is
just
a
difference
in
feeling
when
youre
inside
that
division

we

edwards
lauded
the

as
one

although
its

have
benefited
this

from
a
full
slate
of
games
against
the
afc
and
nfc
west
which
are
generally
regarded
as
two
of
the
worst
divisions
in
the
league
the
bills
have
emerged
as
a
contender
largely
because
of
an
offense
that
has
been
together
for
a
while
i
have
a
better
comfort
level
with
this
offense
and
with
these
guys
in

huddle
edwards
said
theyre
not
new
faces
its
the
same
guys
from
last
year
its
the
same
offense
as
last
year
and
its
the

coaches
as
last

the

took
the
opposite
approach
adding

the
results
have
been

rosenthal

its

the
difference
is
that

smith
said
because
of
the
expense
advanced
lighting
systems
are
being
installed
primarily
in
new
buildings
or
offices
being
retrofitted
for
new
tenants
so
changes
to
the
citys
nightscape
will
come
gradually
over
many
years
but
more
and
more
building
owners
are
writing
leases
that
require
tenants
to
pay
for
their
own
electricity
leading
many
tenants
to
install
more
efficient
lights
a
lot
of
the
new
energyefficient
fixtures
were
designed
to
fit
into
the
ceiling
spaces
that
now
hold
older
fixtures
making
the
upgrades
easier
and
cheaper
lights
will
diminish
said
guy
geier
senior
partner
at
fxfowle
an
architecture
and
interior
design
firm
in
manhattan
because
over
10
or
20
years
those
leases
are
going
to
roll
over
and
the
incentive
is
going
to
be
there
to
start
installing
newer
lights
this
is
not
the
first
time
innovations
in
technology
and
construction
have
been
visible
in
the
nightscape
in
the
early
20th
century
many
buildings
lacked
airconditioners
so
they
were
designed
to
have
most
workers
sitting
near
windows
that
meant
the
yellowish
light
from
the
incandescent
bulbs
hanging
above
their
desks
flooded
through
open
windows
into
the
street
as
central
airconditioning
and
fluorescent
lights
spread
after
world
war
ii
architects
could
build
skyscrapers
enclosed
in
glass
which
gave
off
a
cooler
light
at
the
same
time
more
interior
space
was
now
viable
though
lights
there
were
less
visible
from
the
outside
but
as
tall
towers
multiplied
the
volume
of
light
in
manhattan
increased
many
buildings
had
only
a
few
light
switches
on
each
floor
so
if
even
one
person
was
in
the
office
large
swaths
were
aglow
james
sanders
who
used
to
work
for
the
port
authority
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
recalled
arriving
at
work
one
sunday
in
1985
finding
only
two
switches
on
the
entire
84th
floor
of
one
of
the
world
trade
center
towers
and
discovering
that
a
janitor
had
to
be
called
to
flip
one
they
had
to
switch
a
halfacre
of
lights
on
just
for
me
he
said
to
his
bosses
who
were
the
landlords
leaving
lights
on
all
evening
was
in
part
a
symbol
of
power
he
said
these
days
such
landlords
can
light
perimeter
offices
while
keeping
the
center
of
a
building
dark
others
are
installing
more
efficient
led
lights
outside
buildings
in
place
of
older
floodlights
still
others
are

techniques
at

installing

led
fixtures
on
the
clock
tower
in
september
the
fixtures
which
are
meant
to
last
15
years
use
63
percent
less
energy
than
conventional
lights
and
can
be
programmed
to
produce
millions
of
colors
without
the
need
for
filters
like
those
used
at
the
empire
state
or
other
equipment
such
ornamental
statements
will
most
likely
become
more
prominent
as
the
interiors
of

continue
to
dim
over

citys

said
sabedra
the

at

on

its
something
wonderful
and
beautiful
about
the

when
it
transforms
at

its
building
glow
its
glowing

its
a
wonderful
sight
until
recently
few
people
would
have
thought
felipe
massa
a
small
modest
brazilian
would
be
challenging
for
the
formula
one
title
at
the
brazilian
grand
prix
on
sunday
in
the
last
race
of
the
season
massa
trails
the
series
leader
lewis
hamilton
of
mclaren
mercedes
by
7
points
and
will
need
as
much
luck
as
his
ferrari
teammate
kimi
raikkonen
had
last
year
when
he
won
the
race
and
the
championship
by
a
point
but
massa
a
winner
of
five
races
this
season
said
that
did
not
worry
him
i
have
zero
pressure
because
i
have
nothing
to
lose
he
said
the
only
thing
i
am
thinking
about
is
winning
after
that
the
matter
is
not
in
my
hands
but
massa
did
take
a
step
toward
making
his
task
easier
on
saturday
he
delighted
tens
of
thousands
of
fans
packing
his
home
countrys
26mile
interlagos
track
by
winning
the
pole
for
the
race
with
a
time
of
1
minute
12368
seconds
in
his
ferrari
now
he
needs
to
win
and
have
hamilton
finish
sixth
or
lower
ferrari
for
its
part
seems
to
have
always
believed
in
him
he
signed
with
ferrari
in
2002
four
years
before
he
drove
for
the
team
it
is
the
only
such
contract
ferrari
has
given
a
young
driver
another
who
believed
in
him
early
on
was
peter
sauber
the
founder
of
the
sauber
team
who
was
the
first
to
hire
massa
and
raikkonen
in
raikkonen
sauber
saw
formidable
mental
strength
in
massa
he
was
impressed
by
his
natural
abilities
it
has
taken
the
27yearold
massa
years
to
build
his
mental
strength
and
racing
craft
but
he
is
one
of
the
most
complete
drivers
in
the
series
and
he
has
almost
lived
down
his
firstyear
reputation
as
an
erratic
unstable
driver
he
was
20
when
he
began
with
sauber
in
2002
and
he
had
repeated
errors
and
accidents
my
first
year
i
was
really
a
kind
of
a
wild
guy
massa
said
but
i
had
a
very
difficult
car
to
drive
and
i
was
very
young
i
think
i
was
maybe
too
young
to
have
started
straight
away
his
rise
to
the
top
happened
quickly
massa
had
just
won
the
italian
and
european
formula
renault
titles
and
was
about
to
join
the
formula
3000
euro
series
in
italy
when
he
met
with
jean
todt
the
ferrari
director
the
only
thing
he
said
is
that
he
had
heard
about
me
and
he
said
i
need
to
win
the
f3000
championship
first
massa
said
he
won
it
and
todt
signed
him
to
a
contract
from
2002
through
2008
that
deal
was
later
extended
through
2010
but
massa
did
not
race
for
ferrari
until
2006
he
still
had
much
to
learn
after
his
troubled
first
year
with
sauber
massa
took
2003
off
to
test
drive
for
ferrari
hoping
to
improve
his
technical
skills
confidence
and
team
relations
if
you
know
how
to
set
up
the
car
if
you
know
how
to
work
with
the
team
you
know
what
you
need
to
have
a
comfortable
car
to
drive
he
said
that
was
a
big
learning
experience
when
i
was
a
ferrari
test
driver
returning
to
sauber
in
2004
massa
was
indeed
a
better
driver
scoring
12
points
that
year
and
11
points
in
2005
in
2006
he
joined
michael
schumacher
at
ferrari
and
quickly
proved
to
be
as
fast
as
him
massa
got
his
first
victory
at
the
turkish
grand
prix
he
also
learned
from
schumacher
the
way
he
works
as
a
leader
i
think
thats
very
important
for
you
to
grow
inside
the
team
to
work
with
the
team
and
to
say
exactly
what
you
want
to
push
hard
in
every
area
massa
said
last
year
his
first
without
schumacher
was
crucial
ferrari
had
invested
heavily
in
raikkonen
who
was
expected
to
lead
the
team
but
massa
challenged
for
the
title
up
to
the
fourthtolast
race
the
italian
grand
prix
at
monza
in
a
battle
between
him
raikkonen
and
hamilton
after
massa
dropped
out
of
the
monza
race
with
a
broken
suspension
ferrari
decided
he
should
support
raikkonen
even
though
massa
had
a
mathematical
chance
to
win
the
title
i
was
3
points
behind
kimi
he
said
but
the
difference
was
compared
to
the
first
so
if
they
put
me
still
in
the
position
to
be
able
to
win
the
championship
we
were
not
going
to
be
champions
because
kimi
won
by
only
1
point
it
was
the
right
decision
even
so
massa
said
it
was
difficult
to
accept
and
it
became
even
more
difficult
in
the
last
race
massas
home
race
as
with
massa
and
hamilton
this
weekend
hamilton
and
raikkonen
were
separated
by
7
points
massa
had
been
the
fastest
all
weekend
in
so
paulo
but
he
was
forced
to
give
up
the
lead
to
help
raikkonen
win
the
title
he
did
so
ungrudgingly
and
raikkonen
made
it
clear
that
it
was
thanks
to
massa
that
he
won
the
title
we
were
not
really
racing
against
each
other
so
a
big
thanks
to
the
team
a
big
thanks
to
felipe
raikkonen
said
after
the
race
in
2008
many
expected
raikkonen
to
be
even
stronger
he
won
the
second
race
of
the
season
and
massa
failed
to
score
points
in
either
the
first
or
the
second
race
but
massa
won
the
third
race
the
bahrain
grand
prix
finished
second
in
spain
won
in
turkey
and
finished
third
in
monaco
he
has
been
consistent
ever
since
winning
a
total
of
five
races
but
he
also
gained
7
points
because
of
penalties
against
hamilton
and
another
driver
one
of
those
penalties
resulted
in
massas
inheriting
the
victory
in
belgium
after
the
race
was
over
and
he
had
crossed
the
finish
line
in
second
his
quiet
confidence
is
often
misinterpreted
by
his
critics
as
weakness
but
he
said
that
the
low
expectations
made
his
good
results
all
the
sweeter
people
always
put
me
completely
out
of
the
game
and
thats
even
nicer
because
nobody
expects
you
to
do
a
good
job
and
then
you
do
a
better
job
than
everybody
thinks
and
its
nicer
massa
said
by
the
time
polls
open
tuesday
morning
officials
predict
that
as
many
as
35
percent
of
florida
voters
already
will
have
cast
ballots
via
early
voting
or
absentee
ballot
good
thing
thats
nearly
4million

who
can
stay
away
while
the
rest
of

nov
4
electorate
an
estimated
56million
people
votes
the
oldfashioned
way
at
the
precinct
polling
place
early
and
absentee
voters
have
relieved
pressure
on
polling
places
in
advance
of
what
many
say
will
be
a
monumental
turnout
but
a
times
analysis
indicates
that
it
wont
be
enough
to
reduce
long
lines
on
election
day
if
projections
hold
true
the
numbers
of
new
registered
voters
are
so
large
more
than
1million
this
year
and
the
expected
total
turnout
for
the
election
is
so
high
85
percent
of
112million
registered
voters
that
traffic
in
florida
polling
places
still
will
be
heavier
than
it
was
in
2004
in
addition
most
florida
voters
will
be
using
optical
scan
ballots
for
the
first
time
and
election
officials
expect
it
to
take
them
longer
to
vote
on
the
new
system
than
it
did
on
the
old
touch
screen
machines
all
signs
point
to
longer
lines
than
in
2004
when
many
people
waited
an
hour
or
more
to
vote
imagine
if
early
voting
wasnt
there
said
sean
greene
a
manager
for
electionlineorg
an
election
information
project
of
the

on

the
average
florida

saw
718

on

day
2004
thats
60

an
hour
if

projections
hold
true
for
tuesday
the
average

could
see
810
voters
or
67
voters
an

in
pinellas
an

could
go

an

up
four
voters
over
2004
in
miamidade
county
where
there
are
fewer
precincts
per

the

could
increase
by
20

an
hour
theres
an
energy
and
an
excitement
and
an
interest
that
i
have
not
seen
in
my
31
years
doing
this
said
pinellas
supervisor
of
elections
deborah
clark
voters
are
generally
excited
about
a
presidential
election
but
this
is
off
the
charts
experts
credit
big
issues
and
the
prospect
of
electing
the
first
africanamerican
president
or
the
first
female
vice
president
how
you
react
to
the
coming
onslaught
depends
on
your
outlook
some
voting
advocates
wary
of
scaring
people
away
from
the
polls
say
long
waits
are
not
optimal
but
thats
the
price
of
democracy
others
say
excessive
wait
times
are
good
reason
to
worry
about
voters
being
disenfranchised
election
officials
tend
to
take
a
brighter
view
their
attitude
toward
high
turnout
bring
it

got
to

judith

codirector

a
voter
advocacy
group
is
less
optimistic
we
are
not
prepared
for
that
level
of
engagement
in
our
democracy
she
said
these
waits
in
line
are
serious
because
some
voters
do
not
have
the
opportunity
to
wait
she
criticized
elections
officials
in
other
states
who
have
made
light
of
the
long
lines
by
comparing
them
to
waiting
to
buy
coffee
at
starbucks
or
queuing
up
for
a
rollercoaster
ride
voting
is
a
right
brownedianis
said
the
fact
that
theyre
excusing
their
failure
to
prepare
for
this
election
is
inexcusable
ever
since
floridas
famously
flawed
recount
in
2000
elections
have
been
under
a
microscope
the
national
association
of

warns
of

electionlineorg
says
another

may
be
brewing
only
this
one
has
the
potential
to
combine
a

an
insufficient

workers

a

on

electionlineorg
recently
released
a

it
offers
a
preview
of

said
there
was
no

if

he
said
why
not
set
out
some

with
so
many
people
watching

now
its
more
likely
that
problems
that
once

will
be

former

program
eventually
fine
tuned

enhanced
by
karl

every

their

only
improve
we
also
hear
plenty
of
anecdotal
evidence
that
the
combination
of
excitement
over
sarah
palin
and
fear
of
obama
has
the
gop
base
at
least
as
energized
as
its
ever
been
at
this
point
in
2004
the
rolling
average
of
polls
compiled
by
realclearpoliticscom
showed
president
bush
leading
florida
by
06
percent
bush
wound
up
winning
by
5
percentage
points
despite
an
unprecedented
voter
mobilization
effort
by
independently
operating
democratic
groups
as
of
saturday
the
average
of
recent
polls
showed
obama
leading
by
41
percent
lets
also
stipulate
that
florida
has
never
in
modern
history
seen
a
campaign
like
obamas
not
only
dominating
the
airwaves
for
months
but
also
methodically
organizing
every
crevice
of
the
state
with
a
vast
army
of
volunteers
and
paid
staffers
its
organized
like
a
highly
sophisticated
corporation
the
level
of
detail
to
which
things
are
conducted
and
the
discipline
to
ensure
that
detail
is
followed
is
phenomenal
said
former
florida
sen
bob
graham
early
voting
is
also
changing
the
equation
bush
won
florida
by
381000
votes
in
2004
and
the
gops
longstanding
program
of
promoting
mailin
absentee
ballot
voting
ensured
that
when
election
day
arrived
about
150000
more
republicans
had
already
cast
their
votes
than
democrats
republicans
continue
to
beat
democrats
significantly
on
absentee
ballots
but
factor
in
ballots
cast
at
early
voting
sites
and
285000
more
democrats
than
republicans
had
voted
as
of
saturday
morning
a
key
question
is
how
many
of
those
early
voters
would
have
voted
anyway
the
obama
campaign
estimates
that
28
percent
of
the
early
votes
came
from
floridians
who
rarely
or
never
had
voted
a
recent
st
petersburg
times
poll
found
that
mccain
had
a
10point
advantage
among
people
who
said
they
intended
to
vote
on
election
day
mccain
is
in
position
to
win
florida
but
he
has
some
serious
hurdles
to
overcome
quote
of
the
week
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
if
charlie
crist
had
been
picked
as
the
vice
presidential
nominee
we
would
not
be
discussing
the

of

has
to
win
all
the
undecided
states
and
pull
off
a
big
comeback
in
places
like
ohio
pennsylvania
and
virginia
out
of
sheer
cussedness
part
of
me
would
like
to
see
it
not
based
on
platform
or
ideology
at
all
but
just
the
perverse
joy
of
proving
once
again
that
were
not
so
smart
watching
the
entire
punditocracy
shifting
gears
to
explain
the
thing
would
be
high
entertainment
but
this
is
probably
not
going
to
happen
you
can
tell
by
the
lastminute
wave
of
desperate
shrill
stuff
screaming
that
obama
is
a
socialist
a
marxist
a
muslim
a
noncitizen
or
that
busloads
of
black
people
are
invading
the
suburbs
in
hernando
county
last
week
a
flier
went
out
to
70000
homes
featuring
twin
photographs
of
obama
and
osama
bin
laden
this
is
the
year
that
it
did
not
work
there
are
several
reasons
first
rightly
or
wrongly
the
horror
of
911
and
the
subsequent
fear
of
imminent
danger
have
receded
they
have
been
replaced
by
weariness
over
the
prolonged
occupation
of
iraq
and
the
stubborn
unilateralism
that
led
up
to
it
second
our
freespending
freelending
freeborrowing
ways
have
come
home
to
roost
and
the
nation
is
in
a
nasty
mood
third
the
democrats
managed
to
nominate
the
most
inspiring
candidate
since
jfk
and
the
best
counterpuncher
and
organizer
since
bill
clinton
who
understood
that
he
was
not
going
to
win
merely
by
giving
a
nice
speech
the
real
story
of
obamas
campaign
has
been
its
technical
expertise
against
hillary
rodham
clinton
then
the
gop

fourth
the
story
line
of
mccain
war
hero
decent
and
respected
man
steady
veteran
of
the
senate
was
shoved
aside
for
a
retread
of
attack
politics
and
the
choice
of
sarah
palin
which
delighted
only
the
people
already
most
likely
to
vote
for
him
palins
appeal
to
the
proamerican
parts
of
the
nation
was
at
least
one
campaign
cycle
too
late
fifth
the
national
league
won
the
world
series
i
dont
know
why
but
that
means
a
democratic
win
most
of
the
time
i
would
have
thought
it
the
other
way
around
since
the
designated
hitter
obviously
is
a
leftwing
idea
if
obama
wins
he
will
win
in
the
middle
among
that
slice
of
americans
not
wedded
to
party
label
or
predigested
slogans
some
of
these
same
voters
were
willing
to
try
bush
in
2000
and
unwilling
to
switch
to
the
guy
from
massachusetts
in
2004
he
is
likely
too
to
have
an
even
more
democratic
congress
but
this
is
not
a
blessing
it
might
prove
to
be
his
biggest
challenge
in
fact
theres
nothing
worse
than
winning
a
big
election
to
go
right
to
a
partys
head
oh
well

now
ive
gotta

work
on
my
brilliant
explanation

im
wrong
the
frenzied
final
push
to
turn

floridas

had
stars
political
and
otherwise
blitzing
the
state
saturday
get
everybody
in
your
family
anybody
that
can
vote
comedian
chris
rock
exhorted
more
than
1000
people
at
a
probarack
obama
rally
in
the
college
park
area
of
tampa
get
your
retarded
uncle
get
him
to
vote
anybody
you
know
with
an
arm
bring
him
down
forty
miles
north
in
new
port
richey
at
least
5500
people
turned
out
to
see
republican
vice
presidential
nominee
sarah
palin
kick
off
a
threestop
tour
of
central
florida
and
in
miami
and
winter
park
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
stumped
for
obama
remember
florida
were
a
nation
at
war
we
need
somebody
who
talks
about
wars
that
america
is
fighting
and
isnt
afraid
to
use
the
word
victory
we
need
john
mccain
palin
told
the
enthusiastic
crowd
at
sims
park
early
voting
ended
saturday
in
many
florida
counties
except
pinellas
where
voting
continues
today
from
noon
to
4
pm
so
the
campaigns
are
shifting
their
emphasis
to
get
every
possible
vote
tuesday
polls
show
a
tight
race
for
floridas
27
electoral
votes
and
both
sides
are
slicing
and
dicing
the
electorate
to
mobilize
their
supporters
thats
why
palin
was
in
pasco
polk
city
and
ocala
on
saturday
stressing
familiar
republican
themes
of
limited
government
national
defense
and
especially
taxes
she
was
working
to
help
win
these
republicanleaning
areas
with
similarly
big
margins
as
president
bush
did
in
2004
its
why
rock
appeared
in
a
heavily
africanamerican
neighborhood
at
a
little
league
field
a
couple
of
blocks
from
an
early
voting
site
and
its
why
clinton
particularly
popular
with
hispanics
was
in
miami
and
central
florida
its
like
weve
been
in
a
long
long
race
and
we
can
see
the
finish
line
she
told
a
firedup
crowd
outside
old
san
juan
restaurant
in
little
havana
we
cant
let
anybody
stop
us
or
trip
us
up
or
divert
or
distract
us
we
have
to
get
across
that
finish
line
everything
is
at
stake
that
we
care
about
volunteers
handed
out
stickers
that
read
hispanics
for
change
and
arranged
for
buses
to
take
people
to
early
voting
sites
and
to
canvass
neighborhoods
how
many
of
you
have
already
voted
clinton
said
a
sea
of
hands
shot
up
amid
a
roaring
cheer
well
heres
what
i
want
you
to
do
i
want
you
to
make
the
case
for
sen
obama
and
its
not
hard
to
make
it
took
a
democratic
president
to
clean
up
after
the
first
president
bush
its
going
to
take
a

dave
rodgers
58
a
republican
from
holiday
at
palins
rally
discounted
the
polls
showing
mccain
behind
obama
he
said
the
undecided
voters
will
go
for
mccain
because
of
questions
over
the
economy
and
national
security
and
mccains
experience
those
factors
played
into
his
decision
to
back
mccain
after
the
third
debate
even
though
he
had
planned
to
sit
out
the
election
remember
back
to
the
2004
election
we
were
behind
too
rodgers
said
a
masondixon
poll
released
saturday
shows
a
neckandneck
race
in
florida
with
obama
leading
mccain
49
percent
to
47
percent
and
5
percent
undecided
that
means
florida
could
come
down
to
whichever
side
has
the
stronger
voter
turnout
effort
im
very
very
worried
i
have
never
seen
people
so
much
as
now
said
laura
vianello
59
a
republican
activist
who
was
waving
signs
for
mccain
outside
the
cuban
restaurant
versailles
on
saturday
obama
is
much
more
organized
and
i
hate
to
say
that
because
im
a
republican
many
voters
who
turned
out
to
see
chris
rock
sported
obama
is
my
president
tshirts
and
many
of
them
said
they
already
had
voted
rock
joked
during
his
sevenminute
routine
about
the
numerous
houses
owned
by
the
mccains
and
said
the
republican
nominee
cant
relate
to
their
lives
and
struggles
when
you
go
to
somebody
for
help
you
want
somebody
who
can
relate
to
what
you
have
to
say
like
if
i
have
problems
picking
up
women
i
wouldnt
call
brad
pitt
because
he
wouldnt
know
what
i
was
talking
about

matt
garza
being
a
former
teammate
of
yours
you
must
have
watched
the
world
series
with
great
interest
i
watched
but
it
was
a
bad
series
overall
it
wasnt
that
interesting
it
was
a
series
full
of
errors
and
not
a
lot
of
offense
by
the
rays
anyway
chase
utley
and
ryan
howard
did
pretty
well
for
themselves
but
all
in
all
it
wasnt
a
great
series
do
you
keep
in
touch
with
matt
ive
talked
to
him
a
couple
of
times
since
ive
been
down
here
he
and
i
have
been
real
busy
we
havent
had
a
chance
to
really
get
together
and
hang
out
so
your
high
school
team
must
have
been
pretty
good
i
suppose
well
we
actually
went
to
different
high
schools
rival
high
schools
but
we
played
on
the
same
summer
travel
team
together
we
played
in
our
world
series
in
nevada
and
wed
travel
all
over
like
down
to
san
diego
if
you
went
to
rival
high
schools
then
youve
faced
his
pitching
right
i
did
when
i
was
a
freshman
and
he
was
a
junior
i
played
varsity
all
four
years
he
definitely
used
to
throw
the
ball
hard
but
he
couldnt
find
the
strike
zone
to
save
his
life
back
then
i
guess
it
was
his
senior
year
and
once
he
got
to
college
he
really
started
to
develop
what
did
you
think
of
the
way
matt
pitched
this
season
and
how
hes
developed
hes
been
real
successful
i
was
real
proud
to
see
how
far
hes
come
to
see
him
out
there
during
the
playoffs
it
was
amazing
we
played
together
back
in
high
school
now
were
in
the
same
town
watching
our
dreams
come
true
so
how
serious
were
you
about
baseball
i
was
actually
pretty
good
i
played
centerfield
i
was
going
to
be
drafted
coming
out
of
high
school
i
got
offered
good
money
to
stop
playing
football
the
dodgers
wanted
to
draft
me
out
of
high
school
they
offered
me
a
lot
of
money
to
quit
football
but
i
didnt
want
to
so
i
just
left
baseball
alone
i
tried
to
do
it
in
college
but
it
was
bad
timing
and
it
didnt
work
out
which
sport
was
your
first
love
my
first
love
was
always
football
because
i
like
contact
sports
i
just
have
a
lot
of
fun
baseball
isnt
really
a
boring
game
but
its
a
slowdeveloping
game
you
have
to
really
have
a
real
appreciation
for
the
game
to
get
into
it
so
how
much
baseball
do
you
follow
today
i
still
follow
baseball
but
not
like
i
used
to
i
was
a
seattle
fan
back
when
they
had
ken
griffey
jay
buhner
and
edgar
martinez
that
was
my
team
back
then
when
i
started
to
grow
up
i
started
to
follow
boston
a
lot
more
youre
a
long
way
from
home
for
the
first
time
has
it
been
a
big
adjustment
i
was
born
and
raised
in
fresno
i
went
to
fresno
state
all
that
you
dont
have
a
friendly
face
for
miles
my
family
comes
as
much
as
they
can
but
it
hasnt
been
that
much
but
the
whole
family
is
coming
to
see
me
for
the
minnesota
game
nov
16
so
im
looking
forward
to
that
our
first
weekly
question
whats
playing
most
on
your
ipod
nowadays
it
all
depends
on
what
kind
of
mood
im
in
if
im
getting
ready
for
a
game
ill
probably
have
on
rappers
young
jeezy
or
lil
wayne
if
im
just
driving
down
the
road
on
a
relaxed
day
ill
put
on
some
rampampb
but
you
know
what
for
some
reason
ive
been
on
this
oldschool
kick
lately
stuff
like
teddy
pendergrass
lenny
williams
stuff
like
that
and
what
web
site
do
you
visit
most
oh
man
its
a
web
site
that
i
always
said
i
wasnt
going
to
get
into
since
ive
been
here
and
away
from
everybody
i
broke
down
and
got
a
facebook
page
i
was
never
a
facebook
or
myspace
person
i
always
believed
that
those
should
have
the
slogan
breaking
up
a
relationship
near
you
everybody
gets
in
trouble
on
there
i
didnt
want
that
its
like
one
big
gossip
room
isnt
it
yes
if
someone
wants
to
be
nosy
they
can
go
look
on
this
other
girls
page
to
see
if
youre
leaving
messages
on
her
page
or
whatever
and
when
you
have
the
rare
free
moment
away
from
here
how
have
you
spent
your
time
the
rookies
go
bowling

malcolm
a
smith
the
minority
leader
of
the
state
senate
is
promising
something
drastic
by
albany
standards
if
democrats
win
control
of
the
chamber
on
tuesday
he
wants
to
share
power
with
rankandfile
lawmakers
whether
he
will
follow
through
remains
to
be
seen
but
in
an
interview
smith
a
queens
democrat
who
would
be
the
states
first
black
majority
party
leader
if
his
party
gains
control
of
the
senate
listed
a
litany
of
the
sweeping
promises
politicians
make
when
they
stand
outside
the
levers
of
power
he
said
he
would
reinvent
the
senates
committees
which
often
have
little
discernable
authority
and
make
them
work
more
like
committees
do
in
congress
he
said
he
would
move
to
cut
the
senate
majoritys
central
staff
by
at
least
15
percent
or
roughly
100
workers
he
said
he
would
narrow
the
wide
gap
between
the
resources
allocated
to
majority
and
minority
party
members
for
office
budgets
and
he
would
move
quickly
to
introduce
legislation
to
publicly
finance
elections
despite
the
states
fiscal
crisis
senate
republicans
express
confidence
they
will
hold
their
oneseat
majority
in
the
chamber
and
tend
to
roll
their
eyes
at
smith
for
what
they
see
as
empty
political
grandstanding
before
an
election
smith
has
made
headlines
before
for
claims
that
did
not
materialize
including
his
boasts
last
year
that
he
was
close
to
enticing
some
senate
republicans
to
shift
to
his
side
of
the
aisle
even
goodgovernment
groups
are
wary
of
bold
promises
having
been
disappointed
by
the
administrations
of
gov
eliot
spitzer
and
his
onetime
running
mate
gov
david
a
paterson
whose
promises
of
reform
have
not
translated
into
much
tangible
alteration
to
the
way
business
is
done
in
albany
the
changes
that
smith
describes
if
they
actually
came
to
pass
could
recast
the
ofteninscrutable
way
business
has
long
been
conducted
by
both
political
parties
legislative
power
resides
with
the
senate
majority
leader
and
the
speaker
of
the
democraticled
assembly
who
form
the
socalled
three
men
in
a
room
who
run
the
state
alongside
the
governor
deals
among
the
trio
are
typically
worked
out
behind
closed
doors
often
with
little
public
debate
or
influence
from
the
remaining
210
lawmakers
its
time
for
new
york
state
government
to
move
into
the
21st
century
smith
said
it
would
be
more
transparent
more
participatory
from
legislators
to
advocates
to
joe
citizen
he
added
that
his
leadership
was
not
going
to
be
about
exacting
revenge
for
years
of
slights
at
the
hands
of
senate
republicans
who
have
controlled
the
chamber
for
more
than
four
decades
under
smiths
plan
to
change
the
senates
rules
committees
would
have
more
autonomy
to
bring
bills
to
the
floor
and
members
of
a
standing
conference
committee
would
seek
to
negotiate
legislation
with
the
assembly
the
ranking
minority
member
of
a
committee
could
also
put
a
bill
on
a
committees
agenda
and
smith
says
he
would
also
abolish
a
practice
put
in
place
by
republicans
years
ago
that
allows
essentially
secret
voting
on
hostile
amendments
or
motions
to
send
stalled
bills
out
of
committees
he
would
require
committee
members
to
attend
meetings
and
would
discontinue
the
practice
of
holding
committee
meetings
off
the
senate
floor
while
the
senate
was
in
session
he
would
also
end
limits
on
the
ability
of
senators
in
the
minority
to
use
what
are
known
as
discharge
motions
to
force
bills
to
the
floor
if
he
delivered
it
would
be
the
equivalent
of
a
political
earthquake
said
blair
horner
the
legislative
director
of
the
new
york
public
interest
research
group
but
as
we
know
from
the
2006
election
when
spitzer
and
paterson
ran
to
change
albany
and
then
they
didnt
do
anything
talk
is
easy
delivering
is
hard
as
it
stands
minority
parties
in
albany
are
relegated
to
poor
stepchildren
status
take
the
issue
of
office
budgets
the
senate
republicans
spent
445904
on
average
on
their
office
budgets
over
the
six
months
ending
in
march
according
to
a
recent
report
by
the
empire
center
for
new
york
state
policy
a
branch
of
the
manhattan
institute
for
policy
research
by
comparison
the
senate
democrats
spent
274316
on
their
staff
budgets
the
report
showed
senate
republicans
have
accused
smith
of
being
more
concerned
with
process
than
with
issues
that
matter
to
voters
but
their
main
and
most
potent
electoral
pitch
has
focused
more
on
geography
than
policy
a
democraticled
chamber
would
doom
upstate
they
say
because
it
would
leave
all
of
the
levers
of
government
in
the
hands
of
new
york
city
residents
for
the
first
time
in
decades
every
single
leader
would
be
from
new
york
city
dean
g
skelos
the
senate
majority
leader
said
in
an
interview
in
albany
last
month
voters
outside
the
city
he
said
are
concerned
about
regional
balance
and
fairness
so
thats
resonating
throughout
the
state
skelos
who
did
not
comment
for
this
story
is
not
from
upstate
but
from
long
island
though
upstate
members
play
a
predominating
role
in
his
caucus
the
reality
is
that
what
most
people
care
about
is
what
the
legislature
will
do
for
them
said
john
mcardle
a
spokesman
for
skelos
citing
issues
like
a
mandatory
ceiling
on
school
property
taxes
which
smith
has
also
supported
these
are
process
issues
that
the
vast
majority
of
new
yorkers
are
not
focused
on
mcardle
said
they
have
sent
microfilm
clerks
and
security
guards
from
their
desks
in
the
capitol
to
the
hustings
of
eastern
long
island
and
the
buffalo
suburbs
they
have
brought
in
a
dozen
outside
consultants
including
a
firm
that
produced
the
swift
boat
campaign
against
john
kerry
to
cut
advertisements
and
raise
money
they
have
spent
millions
of
dollars
to
fight
for
seats
that
were
once
safely
republican
no
effort
is
being
spared
by
new
york
republicans
in
the
final
days
of
this
election
season
which
will
determine
whether
they
continue
to
control
the
state
senate
their
only
outpost
of
power
in
an
increasingly
democratic
state
even
veterans
like
sen
caesar
trunzo

82
years
old
and
running
against
the
son
of
a
candidate
he
beat
a
quartercentury
ago

are
making
eight
appearances
a
day
to
shake
hands
and
ask
for
votes
we
just
keep
going
along
doing
what
we
have
to
do
and
then
hope
for
the
best
trunzo
said
recently
as
he
rushed
off
to
a
campaign
rally
in
patchogue
on
long
island
its
so
important
that
we
control
the
new
york
state
senate
republicans
have
held
a
majority
in
the
senate
for
all
but
one
of
the
last
70
years
outlasting
governors
and
presidents
watergate
and
jack
abramoff
seemingly
immune
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
national
politics
the
senate
majority
has
helped
republicans
garner
millions
of
dollars
for
their
campaigns
and
10
times
that
in
state
aid
for
their
mostly
suburban
or
rural
districts
it
has
been
the
partys
storehouse
of
institutional
knowledge
the
career
springboard
for
generations
of
politicians
and
operatives
and
the
lifeblood
of
some
of
albanys
most
powerful
lobbyists
but
now
the
republican
majority
is
down
to
a
single
seat
provoking
the
most
intense
expensive
and
sweeping
campaign
in
many
years
eight
republican
seats
are
being
seriously
contested
double
the
number
in
most
recent
election
years
its
different
because
theyre
fighting
for
their
survival
said
michael
d
dawidziak
a
republican
consultant
they
havent
fought
for
survival
in
any
of
their
lifetimes
the
potential
loss
of
the
senate
majority
is
usually
mentioned
only
glancingly
on
the
campaign
trail
in
veiled
references
to
the
need
for
balanced
government
but
it
is
the
urgent
undercurrent
to
conversations
in
campaign
offices
in
the
hallways
of
the
capitol
and
among
local
republican
activists
our
troops
the
committeemen
the
volunteers

they
are
very
aware
of
the
albany
piece
where
they
usually
are
not
said
james
p
domagalski
the
republican
chairman
of
erie
county
they
understand
what
would
happen
if
we
lose
the
senate
the
long
tenures
of
many
republican
senators
fighting
for
reelection

some
came
into
office
in
1972
during
richard
nixons
landslide
reelection

is
a
testament
to
the
senate
republicans
endurance
and
agility
but
facing
the
worst
economic
crisis
since
the
great
depression
a
party
name
damaged
by
an
unpopular
administration
in
washington
and
the
chance
that
sen
barack
obamas
presidential
bid
will
bring
a
surge
of
democratic
voters
to
the
polls
the
challenge
has
never
seemed
so
great
this
is
a
national
tide
said
alfonse
m
damato
a
lobbyist
and
a
former
us
senator
who
has
been
a
major
fundraiser
and
booster
for
state
senate
republicans
sometimes
the
tide
comes
in
damato
said
he
was
convinced
that
senate
republicans
would
hold
on
this
year
despite
the
obstacles
they
faced
and
publicly
and
privately
republican
senators
and
aides
scoff
at
the
suggestion
that
this
will
be
the
year
the
majority
cracks
im
confident
were
going
to
be
victorious
and
im
not
thinking
about
what
if
said
sen
charles
j
fuschillo
jr
of
long
island
because
were
not
going
to
have
deal
with
the
what
if
on
the
campaign
trail
republicans
have
used
their
fundraising
advantage
to
expand
the
playing
field
devoting
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
races
in
which
democrats
have
shown
unexpected
weakness
to
offset
possible
republican
losses
on
friday
they
sent
mayor
michael
r
bloomberg
a
key
ally
to
campaign
with
sen
serphin
r
maltese
of
queens
who
is
the
democrats
top
target
in
recent
weeks
republicans
have
aggressively
have
stoked
fears
that
communities
upstate
and
on
long
island
would
suffer
from
a
democratic
takeover
of
the
senate
which
would
leave
the
governors
office
and
both
legislative
leadership
posts
in
the
hands
of
democrats
from
the
five
boroughs
they
are
blunt
about
what
is
at
stake
the
biggest
fear
is
that
if
we
lose
the
majority
all
funding
goes
to
new
york
city
said
fuschillo
after
a
devastating
loss
in
february
in
an
upstate
special
election
republicans
revamped
their
campaign
committee
bringing
on
new
senior
staff
members
several
with
experience
on
presidential
campaigns
since
that
race

where
much
of
the
television
advertising
was
handled
by
a
firm
linked
to
a
former
party
chairman

the
committee
has
broadly
expanded
its
roster
of
campaign
and
advertising
consultants
bringing
in
highly
regarded
talent
from
the
beltway
we
learned
from
the
special
that
the
tv
in
particular
has
to
be
topnotch
it
cant
be
the
same
old
same
old
you
cant
use
the
same
old
political
tactics
said
sen
thomas
w
libous
an
upstate
republican
and
a
leader
of
the
partys
campaign
effort
facing
an
unprecedented
number
of
races
senate
republicans
have
devised
a
buddy
system

as
it
is
known
internally

to
send
senators
from
safe
districts
to
campaign
for
and
advise
incumbents
in
tight
races
party
officials
say
they
have
also
gotten
safe
incumbents
to
contribute
more
campaign
money
than
in
the
past
to
their
more
vulnerable
colleagues
they
now
say
instead
of
trying
to
drive
up
my
margins
in
my
district
i
should
spend
that
time
trying
to
help
one
of
the
weaker
guys
win
his
race
damato
said
republicans
are
also
preparing
to
unveil
the
kind
of
technology
more
familiar
from
presidential
campaigns
with
hundredmilliondollar
budgets
in
several
key
races
on
tuesday

party
officials
would
not
say
which

workers
will
use
blackberrys
to
check
off
republican
voters
as
they
arrive
at
polling
places
and
send
the
lists
to
a
central
database
making
the
partys
turnout
operation
far
more
efficient
in
some
races
the
gop
has
resorted
to
methods
that
are
lowertech
but
no
less
intensive
in
westchester
county
where
republicans
are
hoping
for
an
upset
victory
the
republican
candidate
liz
feld
has
been
sending
handwritten
notes
to
voters
to
ask
for
their
support
the
loss
of
the
majority
republicans
say
would
not
only
put
their
districts
at
a
disadvantage
in
albany
it
could
also
cripple
the
party
itself
the
majority
after
all
comes
with
roughly
85
million
in
earmark
spending
and
hundreds
of
extra
staff
jobs
in
albany
and
in
district
offices
in
most
areas
of
the
state
republican
senators
sit
atop
a
wellestablished
political
food
chain
providing
patronage
jobs
smoothing
political
disputes
and
running
local
party
organizations
vincent
f
liguori
who
is
active
with
the
republican
committee
in
islip
on
long
island
said
that
having
trunzo
as
his
senator
was
like
having
my
father
looking
out
for
me
its
like
they
say
to
the
victor
belong
the
spoils
he
added
theres
going
to
be
a
lot
of
people
looking
for
work
if
he
loses
tampa
halfway
through
the
regular
season
there
are
really
only
two
observations
to
be
made
about
the
bucs
great
defense
disappointing
offense
that
hardly
rates
as
news
anymore
since
jon
gruden
arrived
from
oakland
in
2002
with
a
sterling
reputation
as
an
offensive
playcaller
the
bucs
have
ranked
only
once
in
the
top
10
in
total
offense
2003
this
season
in
terms
of
yardage
the
bucs
are
13th
overall
averaging
3412
yards
per
game
but
they
are
21st
in
the
league
in
scoring
at
212
points
per
game
in
fact
the
bucs
have
scored
just
13
touchdowns
this
season
and
are
on
pace
to
have
one
of
their
worst
seasons
second
only
to
when
they
had
20
touchdowns
in
the
412
season
with
rookie
quarterback
bruce
gradkowski
its
somewhat
perplexing
especially
considering
that
the
offensive
line
with
free
agent
center
jeff
faine
is
probably
better
and
deeper
than
at
any
time
in
the
franchises
history
and
quarterback
jeff
garcia
38
while
hobbled
by
injuries
early
has
done
a
decent
job
protecting
the
football
and
yet
with
a
win
today
against
16
kansas
city
the
bucs
could
enter
the
bye
week
63
and
a
half
game
back
of
carolina
in
the
nfc
south
remarkable
ive
just
been
very
impressed
with
our
team
gruden
said
i
dont
want
to
speak
out
about
any
individuals
although
i
think
weve
had
some
guys
that
have
really
exploded
onto
the
scene
pro
bowl
caliber
players
i
really
think
the
center
is
a
great
player
i
think
were
getting
better
on
the
line
i
think
earnest
graham
what
hes
done
speaks
volumes
about
the
kind
of
man
he
is
and
the
football
player
he
is
defensively
speaking
our
secondary
those
guys
are
for
real
and
our
linebacking
corps
those
guys
are
outstanding
players
tanard
jackson
i
hope
some
of
these
guys
get
the
recognition
they
deserve
barrett
ruud
i
hope
he
gets
the
recognition
so
what
do
the
bucs
have
to
do
to
challenge
for
the
lombardi
trophy
in
super
bowl
xliii
at
raymond
james
stadium
get
healthy
fullback
bj
askew
will
miss
his
sixth
game
due
to
a
hamstring
tear
today
his
backup
byron
storer
is
on
injured
reserve
with
a
torn
right
acl
jameel
cook
who
hadnt
played
in
tampa
bay
since
05
isnt
up
to
speed
on
the
offense
that
meant
graham
had
to
move
to
fullback
and
it
resulted
in
more
carries
for
warrick
dunn
which
led
to
a
pinched
nerve
in
his
back
that
will
likely
keep
him
out
today
warrick
and
i
were
in
there
for
a
while
and
we
were
kind
of
feeding
off
each
other
graham
said
then
everything
that
happened
injuries
to
storer
and
bj
you
got
out
of
that
pattern
weve
just
got
to
get
back
in
that
rhythm
we
need
to
get
this
game
and
get
some
guys
healthy
the
bucs
have
been
without
joey
galloway
most
of
the
season
itll
be
interesting
to
see
what
he
and
antonio
bryant
can
do
the
second
half
play
better
on
the
road
the
bucs
have
lost
eight
of
their
past
12
road
games
and
are
13
this
season
worse
yet
tampa
bays
offense
has
scored
just
two
touchdowns
on
the
road
when
you
consider
that
the
bucs
have
lost
at
home
in
the
wildcard
round
of
the
playoffs
twice
in
the
past
three
years
the
prospect
of
doing
anything
in
the
postseason
on
the
road
is
daunting
but
weve
got
to
win
some
big
games
gruden
said
weve
got
to
play
better
on
the
road
but
i
like
this
team
theyre
together
they
play
hard
we
have
some
young
players
playing
too
were
building
our
team
just
like
everybody
else
is
theres
been
some
real
positive
signs
obviously
there
are
some
areas
wed
like
to
clean
up
and
get
better
at
health
has
a
lot
to
do
with
that
too
youve
got
to
get
your
team
healthy
and
the
best
players
have
to
play
for
you
to
play
your
best
beat
carolina
its
a
safe
bet
the
season
will
come
down
to
the
monday
night
football
game
at
carolina
on
dec
8
if
the
bucs
win
they
will
own
a
sweep
of
the
panthers
and
the
first
tiebreaker
the
panthers
have
tough
road
games
to
navigate
the
second
half
at
green
bay
at
the
new
york
giants
and
at
new
orleans
so
whos
next
now
that
the
phillies
have
given
philadelphia
its
first
major
sports
championship
since
1983
what
city
is
next
in
line
to
moan
and
groan
about
its
title
drought
most
major
cities
with
at
least
two
pro
sports
teams
have
won
at
least
one
championship
in
recent
history
boston
has
been
loaded
with
championships
new
york
never
seems
to
go
more
than
a
year
or
two
heck
even
we
here
in
tampa
bay
have
seen
two
championships
in
the
past
six
years
but
what
about
those
poor
saps
in
cleveland
heres
a
look
at
cities
that
have
paraderoute
plans
gathering
dust
in
some
office
cleveland
in
2004
espn
named
cleveland
americas
most
tortured
sports
city
and
things
havent
improved
since
then
the
championship
drought
is
44
years
and
counting
the
browns
are
one
of
pro
footballs
most
storied
franchises
but
they
have
never
appeared
in
a
super
bowl
and
havent
won
an
nfl
championship
since
1964
the
indians
havent
won
a
world
series
since
bob
feller
was
29
that
was
1948
next
best
chance
lebron
james
has
gotten
the
cavaliers
to
the
nba
finals
once
eventually
he
will
win
an
nba
title
the
question
is
will
it
be
in
cleveland
or
somewhere
else
san
diego
footballs
chargers
came
into
existence
in
1960
baseballs
padres
joined
the
majors
in
1969
the
city
had
two
nba
teams
196771
and
197884
yet
in
all
that
time
the
city
has
never
won
a
major
championship
other
than
the
chargers
winning
an
old
american
football
league
title
in
1963
does
that
even
count
the
chargers
reached
one
super
bowl
xxix
and
were
destroyed
4926
by
the
49ers
the
padres
have
made
the
world
series
twice
but
are
18
in
world
series
games
losing
in
five
to
detroit
in
1984
and
getting
swept
by
the
yankees
in
1998
next
best
chance
the
padres
are
awful
so
its
going
to
have
to
be
the
chargers
with
ladainian
tomlinson
the
chargers
were
supposed
to
be
a
contender
this
season
but
it
hasnt
worked
out
that
way
so
far
buffalo
the
sabres
have
never
won
a
stanley
cup
while
the
bills
are
most
famous
for
having
lost
four
consecutive
super
bowls
in
the
early
1990s
the
bills
won
afl
titles
in
1964
and
1965
next
best
chance
the
bills
are
off
to
a
52
start
this
season
and
the
sabres
are
off
to
a
hot
start
as
well
still
its
hard
to
imagine
either
winning
a
title
this
season
seattle
this
actually
might
be
the
most
depressing
place
to
be
a
sports
fan

some
thought
the
mariners
would
be
a
contender
this
season
and
instead
they
lost
101
games
the
seahawks
were
supposed
to
win
their
fifth
straight
nfc
west
crown
and
instead
they
are
near
the
bottom
at
25
plus
seattles
nba
team
is
now
playing
in
oklahoma
city
the
mariners
who
came
into
baseball
in
1977
have
never
made
the
world
series
the
seahawks
have
never
won
the
super
bowl
the
citys
lone
major
title
came
when
the
supersonics
topped
the
nba
in
1979
next
best
chance
yeesh
the
way
the
mariners
and
seahawks
are
going
seattles
best
chance
might
be
getting
an
nba
expansion
team
and
building
it
into
a
winner
atlanta
yes
we
know
the
braves
won
the
world
series
in
1995
but
that
was
their
only
championship
despite
making
the
postseason
16
times
since
1969
and
14
times
since
1991
in
fact
that
is
atlantas
only
major
championship
the
falcons
have
never
won
the
super
bowl
the
hawks
have
never
won
an
nba
title
in
atlanta
and
the
flames
197280
and
thrashers
1999present
have
never
won
the
stanley
cup
next
best
chance
hard
to
say
the
braves
have
a
good
organization
the
hawks
are
getting
better
the
falcons
are
heading
in
the
right
direction
but
none
seems
close
if
we
had
to
guess
wed
say
the
braves
kansas
city
certainly
not
an
epic
drought
like
the
one
cleveland
is
living
through
or
the
one
philadelphia
just
ended
still
the
chiefs
last
won
a
super
bowl
in
1970
the
royals
have
won
one
world
series
and
that
was
in
1985
so
the
count
is
23
years
just
two
fewer
than
the
philadelphia
streak
next
best
chance
can
we
say
theres
no
chance
eventually
maybe
perhaps
if
the
stars
align
just
right
and
the
tides
shift
and
pigs
begin
flying
the
city
will
see
another
title
but
the
way
the
chiefs
and
royals
are
we
just
cant
see
it
happening
anytime
soon
new
orleans
aside
from
a
few
years
with
a
couple
of
nba
teams
new
orleans
has
had
only
one
professional
team
and
thats
not
really
enough
to
qualify
on
this
list
thats
why
we
arent
talking
about
cities
such
as
orlando
salt
lake
city
sacramento
and
jacksonville
but
the
saints
fans
need
to
be
recognized
and
sympathized
with
the
saints
are
one
of
six
current
nfl
teams
that
hasnt
reached
the
super
bowl
of
those
teams
only
detroit
and
cleveland
have
been
around
longer
the
saints
founded
in
1967
have
won
only
two
postseason
games
next
best
chance
actually
new
orleans
relatively
new
nba
team
might
be
this
citys
best
shot
at
a
title
the
hornets
who
moved
to
new
orleans
in
2002
had
the
nbas
fourthbest
record
last
season
cincinnati
those
in
their
40s
remember
watching
the
big
red
machine
with
pete
rose
johnny
bench
and
joe
morgan
win
titles
in
1975
and
1976
but
if
youre
younger
you
have
only
one
championship
to
remember
and
that
was
18
years
ago
when
the
reds
won
the
1990
world
series
under
lou
piniella
the
bengals
have
never
won
a
super
bowl
and
based
on
today
it
looks
as
if
they
never
will
next
best
chance
we
have
to
say
the
reds
because
the
bengals
are
so
awful
but
its
not
like
the
reds
are
close
washington
thank
goodness
for
the
redskins
at
least
they
have
won
three
super
bowls
but
the
last
was
the
1991
nfl
season
so
were
talking
a
streak
of
17
years
the
wizards
won
the
nba
title
when
they
were
the
bullets
in
1978
and
that
was
the
capitals
first
championship
in
36
years
the
washington
capitals
have
had
good
teams
but
have
frustrated
fans
by
choking
in
the
playoffs
and
never
going
all
the
way
washington
again
has
baseball
but
only
if
you
consider
the
nationals
a
real
majorleague
team
thats
a
joke
when
you
think
about
it
washington
has
had
a
rough
go
of
it
over
the
years
next
best
chance
the
redskins
are
62
this
season
they
arent
a
favorite
to
win
the
super
bowl
but
it
wouldnt
be
droppedjaw
shocking
either
san
diego
footballs
chargers
came
into
existence
in
1960
baseballs
padres
joined
the
majors
in
1969
the
city
had
two
nba
teams
196771
and
197884
yet
in
all
that
time
the
city
has
never
won
a
major
championship
other
than
the
chargers
winning
an
old
american
football
league
title
in
1963
does
that
even
count
the
chargers
reached
one
super
bowl
xxix
and
were
destroyed
4926
by
the
49ers
the
padres
have
made
the
world
series
twice
but
are
18
in
world
series
games
losing
in
five
to
detroit
in
1984
and
getting
swept
by
the
yankees
in
1998
next
best
chance
the
padres
are
awful
so
its
going
to
have
to
be
the
chargers
with
ladainian
tomlinson
the
chargers
were
supposed
to
be
a
contender
this
season
but
it
hasnt
worked
out
that
way
so
far
buffalo
the
sabres
have
never
won
a
stanley
cup
while
the
bills
are
most
famous
for
having
lost
four
consecutive
super
bowls
in
the
early
1990s
the
bills
won
afl
titles
in
1964
and
1965
next
best
chance
the
bills
are
off
to
a
52
start
this
season
and
the
sabres
are
off
to
a
hot
start
as
well
still
its
hard
to
imagine
either
winning
a
title
this
season
seattle
this
actually
might
be
the
most
depressing
place
to
be
a
sports
fan

some
thought
the
mariners
would
be
a
contender
this
season
and
instead
they
lost
101
games
the
seahawks
were
supposed
to
win
their
fifth
straight
nfc
west
crown
and
instead
they
are
near
the

25
plus
seattles

the

who
came

the
seahawks
have
never
won
the
super

the
citys
lone
major
title
came
when
the
supersonics
topped
the
nba
in
1979
next
best
chance
yeesh
the
way
the
mariners
and
seahawks
are
going
seattles
best
chance
might
be
getting
an
nba
expansion
team
and
building
it
into
a
winner

yes
we
know
the

won

so
whos
next
now
that
the

have
given

its

major
sports
championship
since

what
city
is
next
in
line
to
moan
and
groan
about
its
title
drought
most
major
cities
with
at
least
two
pro
sports
teams
have
won
at
least
one
championship
in
recent
history
boston
has
been
loaded
with
championships
new
york
never
seems
to
go
more
than
a
year
or
two
heck
even
we
here
in
tampa
bay
have
seen
two
championships
in
the
past
six
years
but
what
about
those
poor
saps
in
cleveland
heres
a
look
at
cities
that
have
paraderoute
plans
gathering
dust
in
some
office
pueblo
colo

with
just
three
days
until
election
day
democratic
presidential
candidate
barack
obama
teased
rival
john
mccain
for
earning
the
endorsement
of
vice
president
dick
cheney
in
front
of
a
crowd
estimated
by
police
at
15000
in
downtown
pueblo
colo
obama
continued
his
tactic
of
tying
mccain
to
the
bush
administration
president
bush
is
sitting
out
the
last
few
days
before
the
election
but
earlier
today
dick
cheney
came
out
of
his
undisclosed
location
and
hit
the
campaign
trail
he
said
that
he
is
and
i
quote
delighted
to
support
john
mccain

obama
said
id
like
to
congratulate
sen
mccain
on
this
endorsement
because
he
really
earned
it
that
endorsement
didnt
come
easy
sen
mccain
had
to
vote
90
percent
of
the
time
with
george
bush
and
dick
cheney
to
get
it
the
entire
obama
family
traveled
to
colorado
for
the
rally

obamas
fourth
trip
to
the
state
since
he
accepted
the
democratic
nomination
in
august
at
invesco
field
at
mile
high
in
denver
the
illinois
senator
referenced
his
two
daughters
in
attendance
saying
they
had
a
tough
time
choosing
halloween
costumes
john
mccain
doesnt
have
that
problem
he
said
he
goes
out
and
trickortreats
as
george
bush
the
joke
hit
the
sweet
spot
for
danny
jacobs
who
leaned
back
his
head
and
howled
his
approval
we
got
them
right
where
we
want
them
he
said
mocking
mccains
recent
appraisal
of
his
chances
obama
asked
supporters
whether
they
thought
cheney
and
mccain
have
been
talking
about
how
to
shake
things
up
he
said
colorado
we
know
better
after
all
it
was
just
a
few
days
ago
that
sen
mccain
said
that
he
and
president
bush
share
a
common
philosophy

so
george
bush
may
be
in
an
undisclosed
location
but
dick
cheneys
out
there
on
the
campaign
trail
because
hed
be
delighted
to
pass
the
baton
to
john
mccain
he
knows
that
with
john
mccain
you
get
a
twofer
george
bushs
economic
policy
and
dick
cheneys
foreign
policy

but
thats
a
risk
we
cannot
afford
to
take
before
the
obamas
took
the
stage
retired
army
gen
wesley
clark
urged
the
crowd
to
get
out
and
vote
were
down
to
the
final
hours
said
clark
who
was
once
stationed
at
nearby
fort
carson
the
thing
about
elections
is
its
never
over
until
every
vote
is
recounted
i
mean
counted
seeking
undecided
voters
obama
and
mccain
have
been
flitting

said
staging

wants

that

wants

not
just

mueller
said
the
mccain
campaign
called
a
news
conference
after
the
rally
for
downtown
businesses
that
were
dismayed
by
being
forced
to
close
for
the

event
sheila

of
you
obama
according
to
the
mccain
campaign
not
all
downtown
businesspeople
were
grumpy
about
closing
irbys
jewelers
just
behind
the
bandstand
had
a
giant
handmade
sign
that
stated
obama
for
the
future
when
the
political
dynasty
that
is
the
bush
family
effectively
ends
with
tuesdays
election
life
as
joe
ellis
knew
it
will
become
life
as
hes
known
it
the
majority
of
people
familiar
with
the
unassuming
ellis
may
know
him
as
the
denver
broncos
chief
operating
officer
few
know
him
as
the
cousin
of
our
43rd
president
george
w
bush
and
nephew
of
former
president
george
herbert
walker
bush
im
proud
of
my
family
and
their
accomplishments
and
all
that
ellis
said
but
i
try
to
keep
all
that
private
i
dont
share
political
beliefs
or
provide
insight
about
family
members
or
anything
like
that
ellis
mother
is
george
hw
bushs
sister
it
was
a
white
house
run
that
began
in
1980
when
uncle
george
began
his
eightyear
term
as
vice
president
to
ronald
reagan
the
uncle
got
his
own
chance
to
lead
our
country
in
1988
and
then
in
2000
cousin
george
began
what
became
an
eightyear
term
in
the
oval
office
there
were
times
when
the
bushes
were
immensely
popular
in
the
polls
there
were
other
times
when
their
popularity
took
a
hit
up
or
down
ellis
was
steady
as
they
go
i
have
known
joe
for
almost
25
years
and
i
have
never
known
him
to
flaunt
his
connection
or
try
to
gain
benefit
in
any
way
said
jim
saccomano
the
broncos
longtime
chief
of
public
relations
and
i
would
venture
to
say
more
than
90
percent
of
the
people
employed
here
are
not
aware
of
it
proving
his
political
naivet
ellis
once
helped
organize
a
campaign
rally
for
cousin
george
at
dove
valley
he
soon
regretted
the
decision
as
some
democratic
seasonticket
holders
took
offense
joe
is
not
political
broncos
owner
pat
bowlen
said
hes
been
a
football
guy
all
his
life
hes
a
bush
but
its
sort
of
like
a
family
thing
to
him
he
keeps
it
there
this
year
more
than
any
other
there
has
been
bickering
inside
the
denver
broncos
locker
room
the
intelligence
from
one
crosssection
of
the
room
has
frequently
questioned
those
positioned
at
the
opposite
end
there
have
been
times
when
teammates
have
gone
so
far
as
to

gasp

point
fingers
at
one
another
offensive
players
giving
the
whatfor
to
defensive
players
nope
this
is
about
guys
supporting
john
mccain
arguing
with
teammates
who
back
barack
obama
it
adds
another
aspect
to
the
locker
room
broncos
offensive
tackle
ryan
harris
said
you
talk
about
it
joke
about
it
as
friends
its
fun
maybe
the
broncos
rosters
of
yesteryear
were
filled
with
dumbjock
stereotypes
who
passed
the
time
talking
about
girls
cars
and
stereo
systems
the
broncos
of
2008
are
about
taxes
the
economy
school
systems
and
even
foreign
policy
there
are
some
smart
guys
in
here
tight
end
nate
jackson
said
guys
that
pay
attention
to
issues
outside
of
football

and
its
made
for
good
conversation
in
the
locker
room
its
made
for
some
heated
debate
there
is
a
broncos
game
sunday
against
the
miami
dolphins
at
invesco
field
at
mile
high
a
presidential
election
takes
place
tuesday
the
first
contest
deals
directly
with
the
livelihoods
of
the
players
they
all
get
paid
to
perform
on
sundays
the
second
contest
figures
to
have
an
impact
on
the
quality
of
life
awaiting
them
after
they
get
paid
to
those
who
believe
its
a
stretch
to
suggest
the
two
are
intrinsically
connected
where
again
did
the
democratic
presidential
candidate
deliver
his
national
convention
speech
go
obama
broncos
running
back
selvin
young
said
although
mccains
proposed
economic
plan
offers
greater
tax
benefits
to
a
53man
roster
whose
average
salary
approaches
18
million
obama
is
wellrepresented
inside
the
broncos
locker
room
his
most
overt
supporter
may
be
receiver
brandon
marshall
who
has
been
wearing
obama
tshirts
to
his
weekly
news
conferences
his
latest
included
an
obama
portrait
with
the
inscription
do
you
smell
what
barack
is
cookin
the
outgoing
marshall
though
is
more
listener
than
participant
when
the
presidential
race
turns
serious
inside
the
players
sanctuary
usually
the
liberals
in
here
are
outweighed
by
the
conservatives
at
least
for
the
politically
aware
jackson
said
the
conservativeleaning
broncos
it
seems
are
more
likely
to
recite
the
tax
advantages
for
those
drawing
a
600000plus
salary
money
is
not
the
only
issue
in
here
jackson
said
however
what
you
do
find
is
those
who
are
mccain
supporters
overwhelmingly
their
no
1
reason
is
because
of
money
too
bad
tom
nalen
wasnt
around
to
hear
that
the
veteran
center
was
said
by
several
teammates
to
be
mccains
top
dove
valley
supporter
until
his
transfer
to
the
injured
reserve
list
in
september
left
him
rehabbing
at
odd
hours
at
least
nalen
was
replaced
by
another
mccain
man
moreso
because
of
abortion
gay
marriage
things
like
that
proud
republican
and
center
casey
wiegmann
said
taxes
that
helps
but
youre
going
to
pay
your
taxes
no
matter
what
i
mean
ive
been
playing
for
13
years
in
this
league
taxes
are
a
part
of
it
there
can
be
no
debate
the
broncos
are
a
bipartisan
locker
room
a
fair
number
of
players
are
pulling
for
obama
many
others
will
be
voting
for
mccain
kicker
matt
prater
would
be
an
independent
if
he
was
anything
i
dont
vote
he
said
my
mom
wants
obama
and
my
dad
wants
mccain
so
i
dont
get
into
it
too
much
besides
ive
got
my
own
theory
on
voting

i
think
its
rigged
if
prater
sounds
bitter
about
the
political
process
he
has
good
reason

hes
from
florida
speaking
of
al
gore
global
warming
isnt
much
of
an
issue
inside
the
broncos
locker
room
although
one
would
think
it
might
come
up
during
the
sweltering
days
of
training
camp
the
environment
is
not
an
issue
jackson
said
health
care
no
one
cares
about
the
healthcare
issue
we
all
have
great
health
care
in
here
foreign
policy
is
an
issue
but
its
more
of
like
a
machismo
issue
its
not
about
diplomacy
its
about
we
are
america
we
are
stronger
we
have
to
keep
on
the
attack

many
players
were
reluctant
to
share
their
preference
receiver
darrell
jackson
and
running
back
michael
pittman
though
quietly
declared
their
support
for
obama
i
had
never
heard
of
obama
before
he
joined
the
presidential
race
pittman
said
im
dead
serious
never
heard
of
him
but
once
i
started
hearing
him
talk
and
the
way
people
gather
around
him
and
he
carried
himself
he
rubbed
off
on
me
ordinarily
football
locker
rooms
are
like
summer
parties

its
not
cool
to
talk
politics
or
religion
they
are
subjects
with
differing
opinions
which
leads
to
offended
feelings
this
year
though
the
broncos
havent
been
afraid
to
go
there
i
think
this
is
a
bigger
deal
harris
said
either
way
theres
history
being
made
i
think
its
a
reflection
of
the
race
itself
of
course
there
are
more
serious
matters
like
the
dolphins
the
denver
broncos
need
and
knead
the
whole
loaf
of
bread
today
john
elway
and
dan
marino
are
not
playing
quarterback
neither
is
bob
griese
nor
brian
griese
this
is
not
for
the
afc
championship
or
for
that
matter
the
afl
championship
its
not
mike
shanahan
against
jimmy
johnson
or
dan
reeves
against
don
shula
its
not
shanahan
against
nick
saban
or
lou
saban
against
shula
it
is
shanahan
against
bill
parcells
sort
of
the
miami
dolphins
and
the
broncos
will
not
have
perfect
seasons
in
fact
it
must
be
presumed
neither
the
dolphins
nor
the
broncos
will
win
their
third
super
bowls
the
dolphins
once
won
backtoback
titles
and
the
broncos
duplicated
the
feat
25
seasons
later
there
is
no
csonka
kiick
or
warfield
theres
no
floyd
little
theres
no
bobby
anderson
playing
against
his
brother
dick
anderson
therell
be
no
1413
final
score
and
therell
certainly
be
no
1010
tie
its
more
likely
there
will
be
as
in
1999
59
points
scored
by
the
teams
chances
are
for
miami
as
jimmy
buffett
who
has
lived
in
florida
and
colorado
might
sing
fins
to
the
left
fins
to
the
right
dolphins
running
all
around
chances
are
for
denver
as
shanahan
who
has
lived
in
florida
and
colorado
might
sing
passes
to
marshall
passes
to
royal
passes
flying
all
around
the
dolphins
bring
back
the
singlewing
formation
the
broncos
bring
out
their
alltorain
vehicle
the
dolphins
come
with
a
mediocre
defense
the
broncos
go
with
the
worst
defense
in
america
those
dolphins
could
be
called
sons
of
the
beaches
this
season
these
broncos
after
their
mess
in
mass
have
been
called
many
similar
things
chad
pennington
has
never
referred
to
himself
as
the
second
coming
of
dan
marino
jay
cutler
has
referred
to
himself
well
you
know
how
he
has
referred
to
himself
to
wit
broncos
vs
dolphins
is
as
fascinating
as
a
bourne
or
a
bond
movie
as
fun
as
spring
break
in
fort
lauderdale
and
the
first
day
of
skiing
in
steamboat
springs
and
there
wont
be
a
snowstorm

not
to
be
confused
with
the
londonowned
corporation
sellout
field
at
mile
high
in
a
1010
game
between
miami
and
denver
the
broncos
got
the
ball
on
a
fumbled
punt
recovered
by
one
of
the
anderson
brothers
late
in
the
fourth
quarter

and
coach
lou
saban
elected
to
run
out
the
clock
and
accept
the
tie
some
younger
football
fantasy
players
among
us
might
ask
why
didnt
the
broncos
go
for
two
when
they
scored
their
touchdown
shanahan
would
or
why
take
the
risk
the
broncos
knew
they
could
win
in
overtime
two
problems
after
the
afl
merged
with
the
nfl
there
was
no
twopoint
conversion
and
the
nfl
overtime
period
had
not
been
invented
in
his
postgame
spiel
justifying
his
decision
saban

half

into

the
next

the

undefeated
the
broncos

john

times
for
both
franchises
many
many
years
later
saban
now
87
told
me
what
people
in
denver
didnt
understand
was
when
i
was
a
kid
in
chicago
during
the
depression
a
half
a
loaf
of
bread
was
very
important
in
the
first
round
of
the
1983
nfl
draft
elway
was
chosen
no

but
marino
lasted
until
the
27th
pick
elway
who
also
was
chosen
in
the
first
round
by
the
oakland
invaders
of
the
usfl
was
traded
by
baltimore
to
denver
but
the
dolphins
decided
to
hang
on
to
marino
and
the
rest
of
the
story
is
written
on
the

at

obama
would
be

so
far
as
i
know
this
would
be
the
first
time
a
whitemajority
country
has
ever
elected
a
non

head

said
boston

it
would
be
the
equivalent
he
said
of
a
jamaicandescended
prime
minister
of
britain
an
algeriandescended
president
of
france
or
a
turkish
german
chancellor
thats
pretty
astonishing
in
world
historical
terms
politics
is
always
evolving
but
there
are
moments
in
history
when
bigger
changes
occur
the
1932
election
of
president
franklin
d
roosevelt
that
ushered
in
the
new
deal
and
a
long
democratic
reign
the
political
upheavals
of
the
1960s
that
began
with
democratic
president
john
f
kennedy
saw
the
civil
rights
revolution
the
great
society
and
the
vietnam
war
under
democrat
lyndon
b
johnson
before
ending
with
the
resignation
of
republican
president
richard
nixon
and
the
gops
rebirth
with
the
1980
election
of
president
ronald
reagan
each
reflected
generational
change
stanford
university
political
scientist
morris
fiorina
who
is
writing
a
book
on
the
politics
of
generational
shifts
likes
to
use
the
rev
jesse
jacksons
gaffe
during
this
years
campaign
to
illustrate
thinking
his
microphone
was
off
during
a
break
in
a
fox
news
show
last
july
jackson
whispered
to
a
copanelist
that
obama
talks
down
to
black
people
adding
in
crude
terms
that
he
would
like
personally
to
mutilate
the
democratic
nominee
talk
afterward
was
about
the
aging
lion
versus
the
young
cub
and
jackson
being
pushed
aside
fiorina
said
thats
really
going
on
everywhere
aging
conservative
evangelical
leaders
are
fading
as
younger
christian
conservatives
question
their
orthodoxies
the
democratic
primaries
saw
a
split
between
older
feminists
backing
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
and
younger
women
backing
obama
clinton
her
husband
president
bill
clinton
and
his
successor
president
bush
all
were
products
of
the
vietnam
era
and
the
cultural
conflicts
of
the
1960s
if
obama
were
to
win
and
serve
two
terms
said
schulman
its
hard
to
imagine
that
we
would
have
a
president
again
who
was
of
that
60s
generation
the
millennial
generation
rivals
the
baby
boom
in
size
and
now
influence
more
than
a
third
of
the
voting
age
population
was
born
after
watergate
todays
college
freshmen
born
after
reagans
presidency
have
no
memory
of
it
we
carry
these
things
with
us
all
our
lives
fiorina
said
and
then
the
younger
generations
coming
up
dont
have
the
same
experiences
and
attitudes
take
the
strong
link
between
age
and
views
on
gay
rights
or
abortion
young
people
take
both
for
granted
for
every
100
people
over
age
70
who
die
and
are
replaced
by
100
people
between
18
and
24
you
get
more
liberal
social
attitudes
fiorina
said
older
generations
grew
up
with
big
government
programs
of
the
new
deal
and
great
society
and
when
those
grew
creaky
were
open
to
something
new
fiorina
said
the
current
generation
has
grown
up
with
a
much
more
laissezfaire
approach
to
government
and
now
theres
a
mess
so
they
say
ok
lets
try
something
else
yet
for
partisans
it
is
the
threat
or
hope
of
ideological
change
that
matters
most
the
mood
among
conservatives
has
grown
darker
each
day
not
only
mccain
but
much
of
the
conservative
intellectual
elite
warn
of
an
impending
turn
to
europeanstyle
socialism
at
home
and
appeasement
abroad
especially
if
democrats
seize
a
monopoly
in
washington
historians
call
the
fears
exaggerated
a
reflection
of
the
countrys
30year
rightward
shift
on
many
issues
obama
is
to
the
right
of
nixon
the
republican
who
proposed
a
guaranteed
income
for
all
americans
supported
affirmative
action
imposed
wage
and
price
controls
and
established
much
of
todays
environmental
regulation
a
conservative
in
1968
was
far
more
liberal
than
a
liberal
is
in
2008
said
schulman
crushing
budget
deficits
will
hamstring
ambitious
policy
changes
despite
the
likelihood
of
powerful
democratic
majorities
in
congress

they
could
resemble
the
1964
democratic
landslide
under
johnson

the
deficit
will
constrain
any
obamastyle
great
society
or
mccain
tax
cuts
pressing
economic
demands
will
land
on
the
next
presidents
desk
he
didnt
have
any
discretion
over
them
theyre
just
there
said
george
edwards
a
presidential
scholar
at
texas
aampampm
university
thats
going
to
be
a
constraint
on
him
the
world
has
a
way
of
doing
that
to
presidents
if
mccain
wins
a
democratic
congress
would
force
him
leftward
as
it
did
nixon
reinforcing
mccains
own
ambivalence
toward
his
party
some
predict
he
would
be
a
caretaker
president
mccain
could
not
govern
on
economic
or
other
issues
from
the
right
said
christopher
malone
a
political
scientist
at
pace
university
hes
going
to
look
at
58
59
democratic
senators
he
has
no
option
but
to
govern
from
the

mccain
could
emulate
eisenhower
who
lost
control
of
congress
in
his
first
term
and
only
modulated
democratic
policies
an
obama
victory
offers
two
potential
paths
a
major
political
realignment
following
roosevelt
in
1932
and
reagan
in
1980
this
would
require
that
he
rack
up
successes
in
his
first
two
years
a
honeymoon
when
presidential
power
is
at
its
peak
if
he
does
and
realignment
is
under
way
he
could
avoid
the
catastrophic
losses
that
clinton
suffered
after
his
1993
health
care
plan
crashed
under
a
democratic
congress
replaced
in
1994
by
a
republican
one
another
model
is
1964
with
a
big
democratic
win
followed
by
a
collapse
four
years
later
or
1976
when
democrat
jimmy
carter
ran
a
flawless
campaign
but
proved
a
weak
leader
unable
to
control
his
party
or
rally
the
public
you
could
have
a
scenario
where
obama
is
under
a
lot
of
pressure
from
his
left
and
yet
cant
do
big
economic
things
because
of
the
difficult
situation
were
in
where
he
cant
disengage
from
iraq
and
afghanistan
as
quickly
as
the
base
would
like
fiorina
said
obama
could
then
come
under
attack
from
his
left
face
congressional
losses
in
2010
and
by
2012
a
challenge
from
his
own
party
perhaps
hillary
clinton
whatever
happens
many
sense
that
the
page
is
turning
this
is
one
of
those
very
rare
onceinageneration
transforming
elections
in
america
that
marks
the
end
of
one
political
era
and
the
beginning
of
another
said
allan
lichtman
a
political
historian
at
american
university
that
will
certainly
be
true
if
obama
is
elected
because
hes
going
to
come
in
with
overwhelming
control
of
the
government
its
even
true
if
mccain
gets
elected
because
hes
not
going
to
be
able
to
turn
back
the
clock
to
the
old
conservative
era
los
angeles

their
votes
wont
count
this
year
but
the
750
kids
going
to
welby
way
elementary
school
in
west
hills
are
still
going
to
the
polls
tuesday
theyve
already
heard
from
john
mccain
and
barack
obama
played
by
fifthgrade
magnet
students
and
now
its
time
for
them
to
step
into
the
schools
makeshift
ballot
boxes
and
make
up
their
minds
along
with
the
rest
of
the
country
because
its
never
too
early
to
teach
kids
just
how
important
the
vote
is
we
made
ballots
for
the
upper
classes
just
like
the
ones
their
parents
will
use
and
for
the
lower
grades
we
put
the
candidates
picture
by
his
name
said
adria
metson
the
schools
magnate
coordinator
everyone
gets
an
i
voted
sticker
to
show
their
parents
that
they
voted
too
the
younger
ones
might
not
understand
exactly
what
that
sticker
means
but
the
way
metson
sees
it
elementary
school
is
the
perfect
place
to
start
teaching
kids
about
the
election
process
shes
been
getting
out
the
vote
at
welby
way
since
the
2000
election
when
she
took
her
fifthgrade
class
to
both
candidates
local
campaign
offices
and
had
them
meet
al
gore
when
he
flew
into
bob
hope
airport
on
air
force
one
the
sooner
we
get
them
involved
the
sooner
theyll
understand
that
people
have
a
direct
impact
on
how
government
operates
she
said
friday
many
teens
across
this
country
are
already
having
a
say
in
this
election
even
though
theyre
not
old
enough
to
vote
a
new
web
site

my2centsforchangeorg

was
launched
on
super
tuesday
to
give
teens
1317
a
chance
to
get
their
2
cents
in
on
the
issues
we
may
not
be
old
enough
to
vote
but
we
still
care
and
have
our
opinions
said
15yearold
melisa
fumbarg
a
student
at
el
camino
real
high
school
told
the
candidates
teens
are
knowledgeable
and
want
to
be
heard
the
candidates
of
both
major
parties
have
heard
from
more
than
2000
nonvotingage
teens
like
melisa
on
issues
they
feel
most
passionate
about

from
education
and
health
care
to
homelessness
and
global
warming
teens
are
more
interested
than
ever
in
the
outcome
of
this
election
and
should
be
given
a
chance
to
be
heard
said
avery
budman
who
launched
the
site
in
february
were
issuedbased
not
candidatebased
and
were
reaching
these
teens
on
the
internet
where
theyre
spending
all
their
time
these
days
gabbi
baker
16
told
both
presidential
candidates
that
although
she
couldnt
vote
for
one
of
them
this
year
whoever
wins
will
have
a
large
impact
on
me
regardless
most
importantly
this
election
determines
who
will
be
on
the
ballot
when
im
able
to
vote
in
2012
she
said
zach
cherny
17
says
its
important
for
teens
to
feel
as
though
their
say
matters
and
we
have
a
lot
to
say
he
added
between
forwardthinking
schools
like
welby
way
giving
their
students
a
mock
vote
and
web
sites
giving
teens
a
say
on
the
issues
i
think
the
2012
2016
and
2020
presidential
elections
should
have
a
pretty
good
turnout
because
metsons
right
the
sooner
you
get
them
involved
the
sooner
theyll
understand
just
how
important
the
vote
is
san

proposition

is
a
california
ballot
measure
but
ripples
from
the
highpriced
highprofile
effort
to
ban
samesex
marriage
are
extending
way
beyond
its
borders
checks
of
500000
or
more

arriving

even

both
sides
agree
that
what
happens
here
will
have
a
major
impact
on
the
samesex
marriage
debate
across
the
nation
said
david
cruz
a
constitutional
law
expert
at
the
university
of
southern
california
school
of
law
its
not
only
californias
size
but
the
influence
it
has
on
other
states
and
other
courts
with
many
polls
suggesting
that
the
race
is
a
tossup
as
election
day
closes
in
both
sides
are
using
the
final
weekend
to
make
one
last
push
for
victory
the
biggest
event
saturday
was
in
san
diego
where
missouri
minister
lou
engle
and
other
pastors
brought
out
thousands
for
a
12hour
prayer
meeting
to
push
for
traditional
marriage
while
the
gathering
was
religious
rather
than
overtly
political
the
election
was
never
far
from
anyones
mind
tuesdays
vote
represents
a
challenge
to
the
religious
view
of
marriage
james
dobson
of
the
focus
on
the
family
ministry
told
the
crowd
this
is
not
about
hate
this
is
about
love
he
said
at
the
christian
community
church
in
san
jose
about
50
prop
8
supporters
renewed
their
wedding
vows
to
highlight
the
importance
of
the
measure
they
back
i
think
theres
a
surge
of
support
for
prop
8
this
weekend
said
michael
dowling
who
runs
the
house
of
prayer
ministry
in
san
francisco
he
was
in
san
jose
because
theres
more
favor
for
our
world
view
here
than
there
is
in
the
city
the
prop
8
opposition
had
its
own
religious
meetings
across
the
state
saturday
with
san
francisco
mayor
gavin
newsom
joining
an
interfaith
gathering
at
glide
memorial
united
methodist
church
later
in
the
day
newsom
and
assemblyman
mark
leno
braved
a
driving
rainstorm
to
walk
through
the
castro
district
and
remind
people
to
vote
against
prop
8
the
pair
didnt
run
into
many
supporters
of
the
samesex
marriage
ban
in
the
heart
of
the
citys
gay
community
but
if
90
percent
of
san
francisco
votes
against
prop
8
those
are
votes
we
dont
have
to
get
somewhere
else
leno
said
as
he
and
newsom
greeted
people
in
the
edge
bar
on
tuesday
two
other
states
will
vote
on
californialike
constitutional
amendments
to
ban
samesex
marriage
arizona
with
prop
102
and
florida
with
amendment
2
but
neither
of
those
campaigns
has
attracted
nearly
as
many
contributions
as
prop
8
about
11
million
was
raised
for
the
initiatives
in
florida
and
arizona
compared
with
67
million
for
the
battle
in
california
prop
8
was
guaranteed
its
place
in
the
national
spotlight
in
may
when
the
state
supreme
court
ruled
that
samesex
marriage
is
a
constitutional
right
overturning
a
ban
of
such
marriages
approved
by
61
percent
of
voters
in
2000
that
court
decision
meant
supporters
of
samesex
marriage
could
fight
from
a
moral
high
ground
using
the
argument
that
prop
8
would
legitimize
discrimination
against
one
group
of
californians
its
no
secret
that
in
recent
years
we
have
suffered
a
string
of
defeats
on
relationship
issues
said
rea
carey
executive
director
of
the
national
gay
and
lesbian
task
force
action
fund
in
washington
but
a
victory
in
california
would
signify
that
americans
are
increasingly
uncomfortable
at
taking
away
anyones
rights
after
the
court
ruling
california
quickly
became
the
prime
destination
for
samesex
couples
from
other
parts
of
the
country
to
come
and
legally
wed
and
as
they
returned
home
wedding
licenses
in
hand
the
pressure
began
to
grow
on
states
in
which
they
live
to
deal
with
them
as
newlyweds
but
then
came
prop
8
the
ballot
measure
is
a
political
matter
but
its
also
intensely
personal
to
the
many
people
from
across
the
country
who
went
there
to
get
married
said
carey
who
herself
was
married
in
a
northern
california
ceremony
those
wedding
photos
of
gays
and
lesbians
from
california
had
a
very
different
impact
on
the
supporters
of
traditional
marriage
who
were
riding
a
nationwide
winning
streak
twentyeight
state
elections
in
recent
years
resulted
in
27
bans
on
samesex
marriage
with
their
only
loss
a
2006
measure
to
ban
samesex
marriage

and
many
domestic
partnership
benefits

in
arizona
california
is
a
cultural
leader
and
a
win
by
samesex
marriage
supporters
will
embolden
other
state
efforts
to
legalize
gay
marriage
said
carrie
gordon
earll
senior
director

given
more
than
500000
to
the
yes
on
prop
8
campaign
for
many
christian
groups
and
other
supporters
of
traditional
marriage
prop
8
is
a
desperately
needed
firewall
that
will
keep
samesex
marriage
from
spreading
to
the
rest
of
the
country
tuesdays
election
is
spoken
of
in
apocalyptic
terms
by
many
backers
of
the
marriage
ban
if
prop
8
is
beaten
im
afraid
the
culture
war
is
over
and
christians
have
lost
donald
wildmon
founder
of

missbased
american

said
in
a
speech
in
july
california
is
a
big
dam
holding
back
the
flood
and
if
you
take
down
the
dam
in
california
its
going
to
flood
49
other

wildmons

has
donated
500000
to
the

campaign
on
the

side
lesbian
gay
bisexual
and
transgender
groups
have
joined
with
progressives
and
mainstream
democratic
organizations
and
donors
to
oppose
prop
8
both
sides
have
jumped
in
with
both
feet
and
made
california
the
battleground
for
samesex
marriage
said
steve
smith
political
consultant
to
the
no
on
prop
8
campaign
this
is
california
and
right
now
equality
in
marriage
is
the
law
of
the
land
if
voters
reject
prop
8
the
final
decision
has
been
made
and
theres
no
appeal
when
the
polls
close
on
tuesday
voters
on
both
sides
of
the
issue
in
many
other
states
will
turn
their
eyes
nervously
toward
california
anxiously
waiting
to
see
what
happens
next
in
a
social
melee
that
has
stretched
across
the
years
newsom
has
taken
his
lumps
for
the
euphoric
overthetop
speech
he
gave
after
the
state
supreme
court
opened
the
way
for
samesex
marriage
in
may
but
he
knew
even
then
just
how
important
that
ruling
would
be
for
the
rest
of
the
country
as
goes
california
so
goes
the

as
john

before

presidential
scholars
say
you
have
to
look
back
to
abraham
lincoln
who
was
elected
on
the
eve
of
the
civil
war
in
1860
to
find
a
new
president
who
faced
problems
of
such
depth
and
complexity
we
have
a
humongous
debt
and
deficit
there
is
very
little
trust
anymore
in
government
said
stephen
wayne
of
georgetown
university
an
expert
on
the
presidency
and
even
if
the
president
in
mccains
case
tries
to
be
bipartisan
or
obama
tries
to
be
postpartisan
theyre
still
going
to
be
dealing
with
a
very
partisan
divided
congress
that
means
there
will
be
pressures
from
the
party
on
the
president
and
there
will
be
pressures
to
pursue
the
partys
position
rather
than
compromise
he
said
its
a
mess
i
cant
think
of
a
worse
situation
for
a
new
president
to
begin
obama
or
mccain
will
face
a
veritable
rubiks
cube
he
will
have
to
negotiate
the
expiring
agreement
for
keeping
us
troops
in
iraq
at
a
time
when
americans
and
iraqis
alike
are
tiring
of
their
presence
his
commanders
in
afghanistan
say
they
need
20000
more
troops
hell
be
under
immense
pressure
to
shore
up
the
us
housing
market
with
more
than
1million
americans
having
lost
their
homes
to
foreclosure
over
the
past
two
years
yet
money
is
tight
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
in
september
the
us
budget
deficit
hit
a
record
438billion
fortunately
the
winner
can
learn
from
the
past
theres
no
clear
blueprint
for
success
of
course
but
over
the
years
certain
strategies
have
worked
and
certain
ones
have
not
beginnings
matter
ronald
reagan
got
off
to
a
great
start
so
did
john
f
kennedy
and
george
w
bush
jimmy
carter
and
bill
clinton
did
not
the
difference
planning
and
personnel
lets
take
reagan
and
clinton
within
two
days
of
his
election
reagan
held
a
news
conference
to
announce
the
men
who
would
lead
his
transition
and
the
white
house
james
baker
and
edwin
meese
then
as
now
the
economy
was
the
chief
concern
with
doubledigit
inflation
and
high
unemployment
and
reagans
first
87
appointments
were
related
to
economic
policy
said
martha
joynt
kumar
director
of
the
nonpartisan
white
house
transition
project
which
works
with
the
current
administration
and
the
presidentelect
to
ease
the
takeover
reagan
quickly
began
schmoozing
congressional
leaders
friendly
republicans
in
the
senate
hostile
democrats
in
the
house
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
his
legislative
agenda
of
cutting
taxes
revamping
the
military
and
cutting
other
government
spending
the
budget
he
submitted
shortly
after
his
inauguration
reflected
those
priorities
and
set
the
tone
for
his
presidency
clinton
by
contrast
didnt
name
some
of
his
key
people
until
just
days
before
his
inauguration
in
january
his
first
major
domestic
initiative
health
care
reform
failed
in
part
because
the
administration
and
its
pointperson
first
lady
hillary
rodham
clinton
were
essentially
unprepared
they
hadnt
recruited
enough
congressional
support
or
developed
a
strategy
for
getting
it
passed
instead
of
an
accomplishment
it
served
as
a
lesson
once
you
come
into
the
white
house
theres
no
time
to
be
looking
backwards
and
thinking
about
what
the
job
is
kumar
said
but
if
people
are
named
right
after
an
election
they
have
time
to
read
they
have
time
to
talk
to
people
and
they
have
time
to
think
once
the
inauguration
happens
its
very
hard
to
carve
out
that
time
because
they
are
always
standing
there
with
a
firehose
get
smart
aside
from
inheriting
national
disasters
roosevelt
and
lincoln
had
one
thing
in
common
they
knew
what
they
didnt
know
lincoln
was
a
congressman
from
rural
illinois
roosevelt
was
highly
experienced
having
been
secretary
of
the
navy
and
governor
of
new
york
but
he
wasnt
an
expert
on
the
economy
unlike
some
other
presidents
he
valued
outside
and
contrary
opinions
and
recruited
a
team
of
respected
academics
known
as
the
brain
trust
to
help
him
plan
the
new
deal
lincoln
took
the
unusual
step
of
appointing
several
republican
rivals
to
his
cabinet
including
harsh
critics
like
william
seward
his
secretary
of
state
and
in
1862
edward
stanton
his
secretary
of
war
both
later
became
close
friends
and
supporters
of
lincolns
but
when
they
were
picked
lincoln
knew
they
would
challenge
his
assumptions
and
ideas
as
well
as
each
others
members
of
roosevelts
brain
trust
often
disagreed
with
each
other
as
well
he
took
these
people
who
were
smart
and
somewhat
rivals
and
brought
them
inside
the
tent
and
took
what
he
could
from
them
said
michael
shaller
a
history
professor
at
the
university
of
arizona
who
has
written
about
reagan
fdr
and
others
roosevelt
and
lincoln
relished
having
these
strong
personalities
around
them
do
something
as
he
campaigned
across
america
during
the
depression
roosevelt
told
voters
the
country
needs
and
the
country
demands
bold
persistent
experimentation
it
is
common
sense
to
take
a
method
and
try
it
if
it
fails
admit
it
frankly
and
try
another
but
above
all
try
something
and
he
did
when
he
took
office
in
march
1933
unemployment
was
around
25
percent
4000
banks
had
collapsed
in
the
past
two
months
with
no
federal
insurance
to
protect
deposits
and
the
financial
system
was
literally
collapsing
the
first
thing
he
did
was
issue
a
proclamation
briefly
closing
all
banks
to
give
him
and
the
congress
time
to
pass
an
emergency
banking
bill
the
country
had
already
been
through
three
years
of
economic
depression
its
been
a
long
hard
road
and
hes
stepping
into
a
situation
where
people
are
looking
for
answers
said
herman
eberhardt
the
museum
curator
at
the
franklin
d
roosevelt
presidential
library
and
museum
in
new
york
then
roosevelt
abetted
by
a
democratic
congress
got
to
work
on
passing
his
100
days
agenda
16
major
bills
in
all
including
regulatory
reforms
creation
of
the
civilian
conservation
corps
and
initiatives
to
help
railroads
farmers
and
homeowners
it
is
doubtful
mccain
or
obama
would
try
or
need
to
push
so
many
sweeping
measures
next
year
but
the
lesson
is
a
valuable
one
for
a
president
confronted
by
crisis
some
of
what
roosevelt
proposed
worked
some
of
what
roosevelt
proposed
didnt
work
some
of
the
policies
he
advocated
were
contradictory
eberhardt
said
but
what
mattered
to
most
people
at
the
time
was
he
was
coming
in
and
taking
decisive
action
that
in
itself
was
inspiring
to
people
and
raised
hope
he
was
taking
an
active
aggressive
stance
that
he
was
going
to
address
this
problem
pick
your
shots
more
recent
presidents
who
scored
quickly
have
done
so
by
limiting
their
goals
think
lyndon
b
johnsons
dogged
approach
to
passing
civil
rights
legislation
after
taking
over
for
president
kennedy
in
late
1963
or
reagans
focus
on
just
three
things
cutting
taxes
cutting
domestic
spending
and
rebuilding
the
military
he
accomplished
the
first
two
in
his
first
year
despite
democratic
control
of
the
house
reagan
did
one
thing
that
i
really
think
presidents
should
do
said
james
t
patterson
professor
emeritus
of
history
at
brown
university
and
an
author
you
decide
im
going
to
do
one
or
two
things
heres
what
i
really
stand
for
and
what
i
want
to
get
done
and
what
the
people
elected
me
to
do
and
thats
what
he
did
clinton
quickly
learned
that
the
middle
class
tax
cuts
he
had
championed
during
the
campaign
werent
financially
feasible
thanks
to
the
deficits
he
inherited
and
he
struggled
with
where
to
start
members
of
his
inner
circle
disagreed
over
what
they
should
do
first
address
social
problems
such
as
health
care
or
lasso
the
deficit
absent
a
driving
narrative
lesser
and
less
flattering
issues
filled
the
void
his
policy
on
gays
in
the
military
a
botched
attorney
general
appointment
a
scandal
over
firing
the
white
house
travel
office
he
just
wasnt
ready
patterson
said
despite
having
only
37
days
between
al
gores
concession
and
his
inauguration
george
w
bushs
transition
went
smoothly
in
part
because
his
priorities
for
office
had
formed
the
backbone
of
his
campaign
cut
taxes
pay
religious
groups
to
provide
social
services
reform
social
security
and
set
federal
standards
for
education
he
achieved
three
out
of
four
before
the
sept
11
2001
terrorist
attacks
forever
altered
his
place
in
history
he
was
not
left
in
a
position
with
a
vacuum
that
other
people
could
fill
with
discussions
about
the
murky
election
kumar
said
he
could
talk
about
what
he
wanted
to
talk
about
the
public
was
ready
for
it
too
because
they
had
heard
him
discuss
it
perception
is
reality
history
teaches
that
even
if
things
dont
go
that
well
for
obama
or
mccain
over
the
next
couple
of
years
he
may
not
suffer
for
it
its
easy
to
forget
this
but
despite
all
he
did
fdr
never
solved
the
great
depression
by
the
end
of
his
first
year
in
office
in
1934
unemployment
remained
at
nearly
22
percent
by
his
first
reelection
campaign
in
1936
it
was
still
at
a
staggering
17
percent
yet
roosevelt
remained
wildly
popular
carrying
all
but
two
states
and
60
percent
of
the
popular
vote
the
biggest
landslide
in
80
years
there
were
a
lot
of
poor
people
who
had
a
picture
of
jesus
christ
on
their
wall
and
a
picture
of
roosevelt
nailed
up
on
their
wall
often
cut
out
from
the
newspaper
patterson
said
either
of
these
guys
gets
elected
theyre
coming
into
power
at
a
time
where
youve
got
really
serious
problems
that
are
hung
over
from
the
past
that
youve
inherited
if
you
make
a
considerable
dent
in
them
that
is
to
say
if
what
you
do
seems
to
work
out
you
will
have
something
like
the
approbation
and
enthusiasm
among
voters

john

are
sparring
over
the
economy
taxes
health

each

but
the
next

of

may
make
his

on
the

supreme
court
with
four
of
the
nine
justices
in

70s
and
one
in
his
80s
the
next
president
likely
will
have
the
privilege
of
appointing
at
least
one
new
justice
to
the
court
experts
say
if
not
two
or
three
because
the
most
likely
retirees
lean
left
mccain
has
the
best
chance
of
either
candidate
to
significantly
remake
the
court
in
his
own
view
by
replacing
liberals
with
conservatives
relatively
young
and
apparently
in
good
health
the
fourth
antonin
scalia
72
is
unlikely
to
retire
any
time
soon
either
though
he
has
angered
many
conservatives
through
the
years
by
taking
contrary
stances
on
the
environment
campaign
finance
and
medical
research
mccain
has
pledged
to
choose
judges
in
the
mold
of
president
bushs
appointees
chief
justice
john
roberts
and
justice
samuel
alito
jr
who
are
favorites
within
the
conservative
movement
whatever
is
going
to
happen
with
the
economy
is
going
to
be
affected
by
a
lot
more
people
and
a
lot
more
forces
than
the
president
said
wendy
long
a
former
clerk
to
conservative
justice
clarence
thomas
and
chief
counsel
for
the
judicial
confirmation
network
which
advocates
for
the
appointment
of
conservative
judges
its
going
to
be
affected
by
the
markets
its
going
to
be
affected
by
congress
and
by
what
private
banks
do
and
individuals
but
what
happens
to
the
court
is
going
to
be
up
to
one
man
she
added
whoever
it
is
obama
or
mccain
is
going
to
basically
shape
the
court
for
most
of
this
century
and
shape
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
liberal
activists
agree
the
court
now
is
roughly
split
four
to
four
with
justice
anthony
kennedy
72
a
ronald
reagan
appointee
often
casting
the
deciding
vote
replacing
liberal
justices
john
paul
stevens
88
or
ruth
bader
ginsberg
75
with
a
conservative
as
mccain
pledges
to
do
would
push
the
court
to
the
right
which
is
why
as
the
judicial
confirmation
network
runs
ads
in
swing
states
urging
support
for
mccain
the
liberal
people
for
the
american
way
is
running
ads
in
swing
states
for
obama
kathryn
kolbert
president
of
the
group
says
a
whole
host
of
policies
hangs
in
the
balance
including
abortion
environmental
regulations
and
the
right
of
citizens
to
sue
corporations
i
think
this
election
will
have
the
most
significant
effect
on
the
supreme
court
than
any
weve
seen
in
40
years
because
the
court
is
so
divided
and
its
on
the
brink
of
being
taken
over
by
conservative
forces
kolbert
said
philosophically
the
argument
is
how
the
supreme
court
should
interpret
the
constitution
mccain
bush
and
other
conservative
leaders
say
they
favor
socalled
strict
constructionists
jurists
who
view
the
constitution
not
as
a
living
changing
document
but
one
that
grants
rights
only
specifically
given
by
the
constitution
practically
speaking
the
biggest
affront
to
this
approach
was
the
1973
ruling
roe
vs
wade
which
allowed
legal
abortion
in
all
50
states
at
issue
was
the
high
courts
finding
that
the
constitution
guarantees
a
right
to
privacy
and
by
extension
a
womans
right
to
seek
an
abortion
which
is
why
mccains
running
mate
alaska
gov
sarah
palin
raised
eyebrows
when
she
told
cbs
news
anchor
katie
couric
that
she
supports
overturning
roe
vs
wade
yet
also
believes
the
constitution
guarantees
the
right
to
privacy
but
this
view
has
many
other
implications
including
the
governments
ability
to
regulate
business
the
legal
basis
for
affirmative
action
in
hiring
and
the
prosecution
of
classaction
suits
mccain
gave
his
most
explicit
nod
to
this
philosophy
in
a
speech
in
may
at
wake
forest
university
in
north
carolina
which
is
often
quoted
by
conservative
activists
my
nominees
will
understand
that
there
are
clear
limits
to
the
scope
of
judicial
power
and
clear
limits
to
the
scope
of
federal
power
he
said
those
on
the
other
side
prefer
a
more
openended
approach
to
regulation
the
courts
and
civil
and
personal
liberties
obama
has
said
he
would
appoint
judges
with
empathy
for
others
and
whose
experiences
have
shaped
their
judicial
philosophy
give
him
the
keys
to
the
supreme
court
conservatives
warn
and
say
hello
to
national
requirements
for
gay
marriage
an
end
to
restrictions
on
certain
types
of
abortions
and
an
american
business
community
ravaged
by
liability
lawsuits
carl
tobias
of
the
university
of
richmond
law
school
in
virginia
an
expert
in
federal
judicial
appointments
said
in
reality
an
obama
presidency
most
likely
would
ensure
the
status
quo
all
this
talk
about
how
obama
would
make
this
a
very
liberal
court
or
something
is
absurd
tobias
said
if
he
is
elected
the
opportunities
are
just
not
going
to
be
there
because
i
think
hes
going
to
be
replacing
people
with
relatively
likeminded
people
in
their
own
words
from
the
oct
15
debate
i
believe
strongly
that
we
should
have
nominees
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
based
on
their
qualifications
rather
than
any
litmus
test
i
voted
for
justice
breyer
and
justice
ginsburg
not
because
i
agreed
with
their
ideology
but
because
i
thought
they
were
qualified
and
that
elections
have
consequences
when
presidents
are
nominated
i
do
not
believe
that
someone
who
has
supported
roe
vs
wade

would
be
part
of
those
qualifications
john
mccain
well
i
think
its
true
that
we
shouldnt
apply
a
strict
litmus
test
and
the
most
important
thing
in
any
judge
is
their
capacity
to
provide
fairness
and
justice
to
the
american
people
and
it
is
true
that
this
is
going
to
be
i
think
one
of
the
most
consequential
decisions
of
the
next
president
it
is
very
likely
that
one
of
us
will
be
making
at
least
one
and
probably
more
than
one
appointments
and
roe
vs
wade
probably
hangs
in
the
balance

athens
greece

not
so
long
ago
many
travelers
dismissed
athens
with
its
scruffy
streets
traffic
pandemonium
and
lackadaisical
service
as
mostly
a
jumpingoff
point
for
some
really
gorgeous
greek
island
but
since
the
2004
olympics
this
capital
city
bathed
in
millennia
of
history
has
been
rejuvenated
for
the
new
millennium
not
only
is
there
an
efficient
airport
a
sparkling
new
metro
system
and
a
plethora
of
highend
boutique
hotels
but
the
service
at
the
restaurants
i
visited
recently
was
impeccable
more
on
par
with
that
found
in
america
than
in
europe
one
big
plus
waiters
always
brought
water

without
even
being
asked
and
for
a
population
of
more
than
3
million
the
squares
are
remarkably
clean
even
if
graffiti
is
still
ubiquitous
in
general
the
olympics
helped
modernize
the
air
sea
and
road
infrastructure
as
well
as
the
telecommunications
network
it
also
put
greece
on
the
map
especially
for
americans
before
the
olympics
greece
averaged
13
to
14
million
tourists
a
year
today
the
number
is
more
than
17
million
yet
under
all
the
polish
much
of
athens
that
hasnt
changed
a
bit
over
the
past
few
decades

and
thats
part
of
its
charm
take
the
central
market
where
squeamish
tourists
were
visibly
put
off
by
the
colorful
displays
of
dismembered
animals
staring
back
at
them
as
smoking
vendors
carelessly
flicked
their
ashes
every
which
way
in
clear
defiance
of
european
union
regulations
but
i
was
fascinated
having
haunted
food
markets
in
many
countries
this
citys
meat
market
is
perhaps
the
most
amazing
one
ive
ever
seen
stall
after
stall
is
packed
with
carcasses
of
pig
lamb
and
rabbit
with
organ
meats
elaborately
arranged
as
if
in
some
kind
of
macabre
art
museum
in
one
corner
were
gnarled
octopi
in
another
a
stallholder
splattered
with
blood
the
market
is
an
example
of
what
makes
parts
of
this
cradle
of
western
civilization
still
so
gritty
but
its
just
one
ingredient
in
a
sophisticated
mix
of
old
and
new
with
possibly
the
best
still
to
come
if
for
no
other
reason
a
trip
to
athens
is
warranted
just
to
see
the
sparkling
new
acropolis
museum
which
is
offering
free
tours
of
the
ground
floor
every
day
until
the
official
opening
in
march
designed
by
usbased
architect
bernard
tschumi
in
collaboration
with
greeces
michalis
photiadis
the
cavernous
glassandconcrete
edifice
eventually
will
display
more
than
4000
ancient
works
for
the
greeks
it
offers
them
a
real
weapon
in
their
ongoing
battle
for
the
return
of
the
elgin
marbles
seized
from
the
temples
by
scottish
diplomat
lord
elgin
more
than
200
years
ago
greece
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
be
able
to
display
the
elgin
marbles
at
the
museum
beside
its
own
collection
of
sculpture
from
the
2500yearold
parthenon
temple
so
far
though
the
british
museum
in
london
has
rejected
the
greek
attempts
to
get
the
works
back
arguing
that
in
1816
the
museum
legally
acquired
the
sculptures
which
can
be
viewed
for
free
by
visitors
from
across
the
globe
but
pressure
on
the
british
museum
intensified
in
september
when
italy
returned
a
small
piece
of
sculpture
from
the
parthenon
kept
in
a
museum
in
palermo
sicily
for
the
past
200
years
theres
no
question
the
new
acropolis
museum
30
years
in
the
making
would
offer
a
suitable
home
for
the
marbles
the
museum
allows
the
sculptures
to
be
viewed
in
natural
light
with
special
glass
and
climatecontrol
measures
protecting
them
from
sun
damage
the
most
jawdropping
part
of
the
museum
will
be
its
top
floor
where
visitors
will
be
able
to
view
the
frieze
and
then
look
out
the
window
to
see
the
parthenon
itself
in
addition
to
the
new
museum
the
citys
main
attraction
remains
the
acropolis
on
a
hill
only
a
short
walk
from
the
museum
its
still
a
simply
stunning
site
with
the
parthenon
as
its
crown
although
many
of
the
buildings
are
under
renovation
theres
no
question
the
parthenon
is
still
the
citys
showstopper
especially
when
it
is
lit
up
at
dusk
generally
the
best
time
to
visit
though
is
just
after
the
opening
time
of
8
am
when
crowds
are
sparse
and
temperatures
cooler
although
there
are
plenty
of
ancient
treasures
in
athens
there
also
are
many
modern
delights
to
discover
including
hip
pedestrianized
shopping
areas
michelinstarred
restaurants
trendy
shops
and
bars
featuring
traditional
bouzouki
music
one
particularly
delightful
jumble
of
streets
in
the
shadow
of
the
acropolis
is
the
plaka
neighborhood
where
people
seem
to
eat
and
shop
all
day
and
into
the
night
here
youd
be
hardpressed
to
find
a
taverna
serving
a
bad
meal
place
after
place
serves
up
the
most
mouthwatering
greek
delicacies
fresh
salads
fried
calamari
tzatziki
meatballs
lamb
chops
pork
kebabs
feta
cheese
and
spanakopitas
or
spinach
pies
another
neighborhood
popular
with
locals
and
tourists
alike
is
psiri
the
old
leather
district
of
narrow
streets
thats
now
often
referred
to
as
athens
coolest
new
area
a
soholike
place
where
tiny
shops
that
look
like
theyve
been
closed
for
years
give
way
to
a
hotbed

about

from

acropolis
on

psiri
and
close
to
plaka
the
service
here
was
almost
too
good
if
there
is
such
a
thing
with
desk
clerks
constantly
asking
me
if
there
was
anything
i
needed
not
only
do

but
the

also
has

restaurant
and

on

are

all
a
testament
to
developers
faith
in
the
future

on

but
since

the
number
60
has

in

senate
and
tuesday
night

the

of

longtime

thats

as

barack

big
changes
dont
happen
without
big
senate
majorities
nearly
every

prognosticator
sees
big

gains
in

on
tuesday
especially
if
obama
holds
his
commanding
lead
in
the

over

likewise
the

rothenberg
political

congressional

is
a
little
more

projecting
a

democratic

calculates
between

and

says

the

similarly
charlie

that
this
election
isnt

it
is
looking

bad
for

and
seems
to
be
getting
worse
rarely
has

suffered

the

whatever
you
want
to
call
it
this
years
congressional
election
started
out
badly
for
republicans
with
president
bushs
sinking
popularity
the
obama
phenomenon
and
the
economic
crisis
that
sent
mccains
campaign
spiraling
downward
in
the
public
opinion
polls
the
gop
had
23
of
their
49
senate
seats
to
defend
whereas
democrats
had
only
a
dozen
of
their
51
seats
to
hold
only
one
of
which
was
considered
vulnerable

mary
landrieu
of
louisiana
then
five
republican
senators
decided
to
retire
or
seek
other
political
office
this
year

including
fiveterm
virginian
john
warner
and
sixterm
new
mexican
pete
domenici

whereas
the

had
no

then
last

the
longest
serving

involving

and
overnight
the
democratic
chances
were
greatly
improved
in
a
reliably
republican
state
the
democrats
best
chances
for
picking
up
senate

begin
with

underscoring
the
tough

this

one
of
the
most
potent
political
arguments
for
republicans
this
late
in
the

with
mccain
trailing
obama
is
to
warn

news
service
athens
greece

not
so
long
ago
many
travelers
dismissed
athens
with
its
scruffy
streets
traffic
pandemonium
and
lackadaisical
service
as
mostly
a
jumpingoff
point
for
some
really
gorgeous
greek
island
but
since
the
2004
olympics
this
capital
city
bathed
in
millennia
of
history
has
been
rejuvenated
for
the
new
millennium
not
only
is
there
an
efficient
airport
a
sparkling
new
metro
system
and
a
plethora
of
highend
boutique
hotels
but
the
service
at
the
restaurants
i
visited
recently
was
impeccable
more
on
par
with
that
found
in
america
than
in
europe
one
big
plus
waiters
always
brought
water

without
even
being
asked
and
for
a
population
of
more
than
3
million
the
squares
are
remarkably
clean
even
if
graffiti
is
still
ubiquitous
in
general
the
olympics
helped
modernize
the
air
sea
and
road
infrastructure
as
well
as
the
telecommunications
network
it
also
put
greece
on
the
map
especially
for
americans
before
the
olympics
greece
averaged
13
to
14
million
tourists
a
year
today
the
number
is
more
than
17
million
yet
under
all
the
polish
much
of
athens
that
hasnt
changed
a
bit
over
the
past
few
decades

and
thats
part
of
its
charm
take
the
central
market
where
squeamish
tourists
were
visibly
put
off
by
the
colorful
displays
of
dismembered
animals
staring
back
at
them
as
smoking
vendors
carelessly
flicked
their
ashes
every
which
way
in
clear
defiance
of
european
union
regulations
but
i
was
fascinated
having
haunted
food
markets
in
many
countries
this
citys
meat
market
is
perhaps
the
most
amazing
one
ive
ever
seen
stall
after
stall
is
packed
with
carcasses
of
pig
lamb
and
rabbit
with
organ
meats
elaborately
arranged
as
if
in
some
kind
of
macabre
art
museum
in
one
corner
were
gnarled
octopi
in
another
a
stallholder
splattered
with
blood
the
market
is
an
example
of
what
makes
parts
of
this
cradle
of
western
civilization
still
so
gritty
but
its
just
one
ingredient
in
a
sophisticated
mix
of
old
and
new
with
possibly
the
best
still
to
come
if
for
no
other
reason
a
trip
to
athens
is
warranted
just
to
see
the
sparkling
new
acropolis
museum
which
is
offering
free
tours
of
the
ground
floor
every
day
until
the
official
opening
in
march
designed
by
usbased
architect
bernard
tschumi
in
collaboration
with
greeces
michalis
photiadis
the
cavernous
glassandconcrete
edifice
eventually
will
display
more
than
4000
ancient
works
for
the
greeks
it
offers
them
a
real
weapon
in
their
ongoing
battle
for
the
return
of
the
elgin
marbles
seized
from
the
temples
by
scottish
diplomat
lord
elgin
more
than
200
years
ago
greece
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
be
able
to
display
the
elgin
marbles
at
the
museum
beside
its
own
collection
of
sculpture
from
the
2500yearold
parthenon
temple
so
far
though
the
british
museum
in
london
has
rejected
the
greek
attempts
to
get
the
works
back
arguing
that
in
1816
the
museum
legally
acquired
the
sculptures
which
can
be
viewed
for
free
by
visitors
from
across
the
globe
but
pressure
on
the
british
museum
intensified
in
september
when
italy
returned
a
small
piece
of
sculpture
from
the
parthenon
kept
in
a
museum
in
palermo
sicily
for
the
past
200
years
theres
no
question
the
new
acropolis
museum
30
years
in
the
making
would
offer
a
suitable
home
for
the
marbles
the
museum
allows
the
sculptures
to
be
viewed
in
natural
light
with
special
glass
and
climatecontrol
measures
protecting
them
from
sun
damage
the
most
jawdropping
part
of
the
museum
will
be
its
top
floor
where
visitors
will
be
able
to
view
the
frieze
and
then
look
out
the
window
to
see
the
parthenon
itself
in
addition
to
the
new
museum
the
citys
main
attraction
remains
the
acropolis
on
a
hill
only
a
short
walk
from
the
museum
its
still
a
simply
stunning
site
with
the
parthenon
as
its
crown
although
many
of
the
buildings
are
under
renovation
theres
no
question
the
parthenon
is
still
the
citys
showstopper
especially
when
it
is
lit
up
at
dusk
generally
the
best
time
to
visit
though
is
just
after
the
opening
time
of
8
am
when
crowds
are
sparse
and
temperatures
cooler
although
there
are
plenty
of
ancient
treasures
in
athens
there
also
are
many
modern
delights
to
discover
including
hip
pedestrianized
shopping
areas
michelinstarred
restaurants
trendy
shops
and
bars
featuring
traditional
bouzouki
music
one
particularly
delightful
jumble
of
streets
in
the
shadow
of
the
acropolis
is
the
plaka
neighborhood
where
people
seem
to
eat
and
shop
all
day
and
into
the
night
here
youd
be
hardpressed
to
find
a
taverna
serving
a
bad
meal
place
after
place
serves
up
the
most
mouthwatering
greek
delicacies
fresh
salads
fried
calamari
tzatziki
meatballs
lamb
chops
pork
kebabs
feta
cheese
and
spanakopitas
or
spinach
pies
another
neighborhood
popular
with
locals
and
tourists
alike
is
psiri
the
old
leather
district
of
narrow
streets
thats
now
often
referred
to
as
athens
coolest
new
area
a
soholike
place
where
tiny
shops
that
look
like
theyve
been
closed
for
years
give
way
to
a
hotbed
of
nightlife
once

sun

a

was
perfectly
located
about
a
10minute
walk
from
the
acropolis
on
the
edge
of
psiri
and
close
to
plaka
the
service
here
was
almost
too
good
if
there
is
such
a
thing
with
desk
clerks
constantly
asking
me
if
there
was
anything
i
needed
not
only
do
the
rooms
boast
parquet
floors
flatscreen
tvs
and
internet
access
but
the
hotel
also
has
a
stylish
restaurant
and
lounge
on
nearby
streets
are
other
designdriven
hotels
all
a
testament
to
developers
faith
in
the
future
of
the
tourism
industry
as
athens
settles
into
its
postolympic
mode
these
sleek

are
part

and
dozens

in

every
book
starts
with
a
nagging
question
what
if
we
did
a
book
about
the
way
animals
talk
to

he
wondered
once
the
answer
was

how

can
a

exactly
how

certain

of

questions

whats

to

another

how
the

at

the

jenkins

combine
arresting
images
with
equally
riveting
text
dinocephalosaurus

notes

it
was

that
sucked

try
to
erase
that
mental
picture
before
turning
out

lights
tonight
the
amount
of
time
that
jenkins
devotes
to
research
eclipses
the
physical
work
on
his
books
an
information
junkie
he
is
delighted
to
learn
for
example
that
female
earwigs
are
unusually
maternal
brooding
their
eggs
and

kitsch
including
a

poster
and
some

their
projects
fall
into
what
jenkins
calls
the
niche
between
board
books
and
books
that
are
more
encyclopedic

textheavy
nonfiction
that
may
not
captivate
their
target
audience
of
children
between
5
and
9
years
old
often
a
first
second
or
third
grade
kid
understands
concepts
but
they
may
not
be
intrigued
by
a
lot
of
facts
jenkins
explained
so
instead
you
give
them
a
book
about
problemsolving
thats
really
a
book
about
evolution
before
turning
to
picture
books
jenkins
spent
20
years
as
a
commercial
graphic
designer
in
new
york
city
jenkins
loved
that
but
found
illustrating
childrens
books
as
a
way
to
marry
his
lifelong
fascination
with
science

his
boyhood
goal
was
to
become
a
scientist

with
art
though
jenkins
sometimes
illustrates
books
written
by
other
authors
he
increasingly
writes
as
well
as
illustrating
his
secret
for
avoiding
ennui
never
work
on
anything
that
doesnt
fascinate
me
personally
among
his
current
projects
is
down
down
down
a
journey
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
a
book
due
in
stores
next
spring
that
visually
illustrates
the
oceans
depth
i
was
interested
in
doing
a
book
about
the
ocean
and
i
wanted
to
start
at
the
surface
and
go
straight
down
he
said
if
you
explore
that
thought
its
like
a
diver
descending
the
ocean
is
3
miles
deep
on
average
you
have
the
surface
the
twilight
zone
and
then
the
bulk
of
the
ocean
is
that
dark
zone
we
dont
know
much
about
it
he
says
more
people
have
visited
the
surface
of
the
moon
than
the
deepest
part
of
the
ocean
as
he
researched
the
most
lightless
parts
of
the
deep
blue
sea
jenkins
learned
about
bait
balls
which
are
schools
of
fish
that
swim
so
tightly
bunched
that
their
bodies
touch
as
they
swim
he
learned
about
the
primary
means
of
deepocean
communication
bioluminescence
and
because
he
was
fascinated
by
the
mariana
trench
when
he
was
a
boy
he
chose
the
deep
pacific
ocean
formation
as
the
bottom
of
his
visual
dive
i
wanted
to
do
a
spread
on
the
hydrothermal
vents
where
superheated
water
comes
in
he
said
you
know
until
the
1970s
scientists
assumed
that
life
depends
on
the
sun
but
then
they
found
life
around
the
vents
and
that
opened
new
possibilities
for
anaerobic
life
on
earth

and
other
planets
i
think
about
science
in
a
crosscurriculum
way
thats
a
deliberate
response
to
the
social
and
educational
emphasis
on
standardized
tests
and
a
strategy
for
persuading
young
readers
to
stick
with
nonfiction
as
they
move
on
to
sophisticated
books
theres
a
thing
that
happens
in
fourth
or
fifth
grade
where
kids
move
away
from
picture
books
to
chapter
books
and
from
nonfiction
to
fiction

and
a

have

the

television
had
a
heavier
hand
than
usual
in
conducting
the
nations
political
business
twentyone
months
of
campaign
coverage
felt
like
the
worlds
longest
reality
tv
show
really
though
it
was
a
collision
of
high
and
lowbrow
political
entertainment
and
gossip
outlets
exploiting
the
campaigns
to
their
own
ends

for
humor
for
web
hits
for
ratings
or
partisan
outrage

and
tightening
the
nonstop
news
cycle
but
it
worked
it
made
tv
mustsee
again
and
its
fair
to
say
more
than
ever
tv
impacted
the
outcome
of
the
election
again
and
again
the
campaigns
mattered
less
than
the
media
images
of
them
those
of
us
on
the
couch
assessed
character
and
temperament
via
style
more
than
through
speeches
and
official
statements
the
sight
of
barack
obama
dancing
on
ellen
degeneres
show
meant
more
to
more
people
than
his
domestic
policy
talking
points
the
visual
of
john
mccain
shuffling
around
a
televised
town
hall
registered
on
a
deeper
level
than
his
stump
speeches
feys
spoton
sarah
palin
impersonation
and
courics
devastating
interview
were
turning
points
in
voters
minds
politics
and

called

snake

moment
when
hillary
rodham
clinton
gave
snl
a
shoutout
during
a
debate
there
was
a
lot
of
garbage
but
after
years
of
being
scolded
for
failing
to
ask
the
tough
questions
television
proved
its
worth
as
a
truthseeking
medium
in
the
2008
election
cycle
tv
is
a
great
lie
detector
the
cameras
unblinking
eye
is
better
at
observing
than
probing
but
it
does
eventually
force
truth
to
the
surface
palin
was
terrific
on
tv
until
she
wasnt
prolonged
exposure
allowed
the
american
public
to
move
beyond
palins
starmaking
turn
reading
a
teleprompter
couric
brought
an
unrehearsed
side
of
the
candidate
into
focus
even
as
the
candidate
railed
against
the
filter
of
the

similarly
negative
ads
were
powerful
until
they
werent
repetition
and
truth
squads
allowed
viewers
the
time
to

television

rolling

during

and
his
initial
reluctance
to

his

onstage
did
not
play
well
on

often
his
battleworn

seemed
at

with
the
battletested
words
he
expressed
the

be

in

the

and
the

reported
that

ambassador
to

hispanic
americans
could
be
a
decisive
factor
in
tuesdays
presidential
election
in
the
three
battleground
states
of
new
mexico
nevada
and
colorado
both
sen
barack
obama
dill
and
sen
john
mccain
rariz
have
aggressively
campaigned
in
these
states
which
president
bush
carried
in
2004
and
which
are
home
to
large
hispanic
populations
polls
show
obama
leading
mccain
in
these
states
where
polls
also
show
that
hispanic
voters
prefer
the
democrat
from
illinois
by
large
margins
assuming
that
obama
wins
all
252
of
the
electoral
votes
won
by
sen
john
kerry
dmass
in
his
unsuccessful
2004
bid
for
the
presidency
the
19
electoral
votes
in
new

nevada
and
colorado
would
provide
obama
with
271
electoral
votes
one
more
than
he
needs
to
win
the
white
house
that
means
that
if
obama
wins
those
states
he
could
still
clinch
the
presidency

even
without
prevailing
in
other
battleground
states
like
ohio
and
florida
a
key
question
is
whether
hispanic
voters
will
defy
historical
trends
and
actually
turn
out
to
vote
tuesday
voter
participation
in
hispanic
communities
has
historically
been
lower
than
the
national
turnout
much
to
the
consternation
of
hispanic
political
activists
who
note
that
the
group
is
the
nations
fastest
growing
racial
or
ethnic
demographic
for
example
hispanics
represented
143
percent
of
the

population
in

but
only
cast
6
percent
of

analysts

this

will

that

notes
that

have
increased
each
cycle
since
1980
and
that
efforts

this

mccain
and

have
aggressively
campaigned
for
the
hispanic

particularly
through
spanishlanguage

those

statewide

a

from

an

ellie
klerlein
field
and
civic

strategist
for
the
national
council
of
la
raza
said
that
though
immigration
is
generally
not
listed
as
a
top
issue
for
hispanic
voters

as
with
most
voters
economic
concerns
fill
that
slot
for
hispanics

it
does
drive
these
individuals
perception
of
candidates
polls
have
shown
that
its
something
that
latinos
use
as
sort
of
a
way
to
get
a
feel
for
how
candidates
think
about
their
community
klerlein
said
immigration
issues
in
this
years
contest
have
often
been
just
below
the
surface
except
in
the
spanishlanguage
news
media
where
both
the
obama
and
mccain
campaigns
have
slugged
at
each
other
over
immigration
according
to
frank
sharry
executive
director
at
americas
voice
an
organization
which
presses
for
immigration
reform
one
issue
is
the
degree
to
which
mccain
will
be
faulted
for
republican
immigration
policies
and
rhetoric
that
is
unpopular
in
the
hispanic
community
in
sharrys
view
mccain
had
to
run
away
from
the
latino
community
during
his
primary
campaign
in
order
to
attract
his
partys
conservative
base
the
result
wilkes
said
is
that
mccain
has
lost
support
from
latino
voters
who
once
admired
his
2006
efforts
with
sen
ted
kennedy
dmass
at
immigration
reform
his
support
couldnt
really
overcome
the
negative
perceptions
of
the
party
wilkes
explained
avoiding
that
negative
association
may
be
particularly
important
in
mccains
efforts
to
win
over
new
young
latino
voters
and
newly
naturalized
citizens
these
voters
who
are
new
to
the
political
process
dont
yet
have
entrenched
voting
patterns
said
erica
bernal
martinez
senior
director
of
civic
engagement
at
naleo
mccain
and
obama
will
therefore
have
to
address
issues
like
the
economy
the
war
in
iraq
health
care
and
education
in
order
to
gain
votes
from
those
individuals
martinez
said
the
latino
community
has
matured
politically
theyre
really
looking
for
policy
decisions
martinez
said
this
isnt
about
can
someone
speak
to
me
in
spanish
and
is
that
going
to
be
enough

the
one
certainty
of
tuesdays
national
election
is
that
a
sitting
senator
will
be
elected
president
marking
the
first
time
someone
has
gone
directly
from
the
senate
to
the
white
house
in
almost
50
years
of
the
nations
43
presidents
the
only
two
who
were
elected
while
in
the
senate
were
democrat
john
f
kennedy
in
1960
and
republican
warren
harding
40
years
before
that
either
sen
john
mccain
or
sen
barack
obama
will
be
only
the
third
president
to
come
directly
from
the
senate
in
225
years
having
us
senate
at
the
top
of
the
winners
resume
will
be
a
mixed
blessing
once
he
enters
the
white
house
according
to
political
scientists
and
presidential
historians
the
senator
who
enters
the
white
house
thinks
that
he
knows
washington
said
stephen
hess
a
presidential
expert
at
the
brookings
institution
a
dcbased
think
tank
the
problem
is
that
what
he
knows
about
washington
is
capitol
hill
a
major
liability
for
any
former
senator
is
that
he
can
be
viewed
as
a
washington
insider

a
creature
of
the
congress
in
which
he
served

and
unable
to
meet
the
needs
of
states
and
everyday
people
once
in
the
white
house
and
the
skills
that
generally
make
good
senators

such
as
the
ability
to
negotiate
and
compromise

dont
translate
to
the
white
house
where
a
president
is
often
called
on
to
be
decisive
on
the
campaign
trail
and
once
in
the
white
house
senators
have
been
hindered
by
the
fact
that
they
talk
in
senatespeak

said
barry
burden
a
political
science
professor
at
the
university
of
wisconsin
who
has
studied
how
wouldbe
presidents
in
the
senate
outside
the
institution
that
sort
of
talk
just
doesnt
resonate
with
voters
the
winner
in
tuesdays
election
can
immediately
capitalize
on
his
legislative
skills
by
taking
a
lead
role
later
in
november
when
congress
reconvenes
to
craft
another
economic
stimulus
package
in
the
unique
position
as
a
sitting
senator
poised
to
become
president
on
jan
20
either
mccain
or
obama
could
help
write

and
even
introduce

the
financial
relief
package
congressional
leaders
hope
to
debate
later
this
month
were
going
to
see
action
immediately
like
key
appointments

for
the
secretary
of
the
treasury

and
appointing
an
economic
stimulus
team
predicts
larry
berman
a
professor
of
political
science
at
the
university
of
california
davis
the
senatorturnedpresident
can
draw
on
his
firsthand
knowledge
of
the
personalities
in
congress
and
the
sometimes
arcane
procedural
rules
and
traditions
that
can
help
propel
a
legislative
agenda
on
capitol
hill
or
stop
it
in
its
tracks
both
obama
and
mccain
would
be
able
to
capitalize
on
their
personal
connections
with
former
colleagues
in
congress
to
push
their
own
priorities
from
the
other
end
of
pennsylvania
avenue
the
presidentelect
will
still
have
all
the
contacts
and
understand
what
committees
are
important
and
can
work
the
system
from
the
outside
which
is
really
impressive
and
rare
burden
said
for
instance
president
lyndon
b
johnsons
12
years
in
the
senate

including
six
years
running
the
chamber
as
its
majority
leader

gave
him
an
advantage
in
pushing
civil
rights
legislation
and
the
great
society
agenda
during
his
time
in
the
white
house
although
johnson
had
more
than
a
decade
of
experience
in
the
senate
his
launching
pad
to
the
presidency
was
as
vice
president
when
kennedy
was
assassinated
he
got
an
amazing
amount
of
legislation
passed
because
of
what
he
knew
about
the
senate
hess
said
by
contrast
former
president
bill
clintons
first
big
initiative

to
overhaul
the
nations
health
care
system

failed
partly
because
the
former
arkansas
governor
tried
to
craft
it
without
involving
congress
a
former
senator
would
immediately
know
such
a
move
would
alienate
lawmakers
expecting
to
play
a
key
role
in
the
debate
the
legislative
experience
obama
and
mccain
would
bring
to
the
presidency
would
be
a
departure
from
the
experience
of
governors
who
have
frequently
occupied
the
white
house
their
knowledge
of
the
legislative
process
is
a
major
advantage
berman
said
governors



have
executive
experience
but
its
a
different
kind
of
experience
history
shows
that
senators
have
a
tough
time
getting
elected
to
the
white
house
even
for
those
few
who
were
nominated
since
kennedys
time
at
least
56
sitting
senators
have
run
for
the
presidency
according
to
burdens
research
only
a
handful
won
their
partys
nomination
most
recently
john
kerry
dmass
in
2004
and
former
sen
robert
dole
rkan
in
1996
this
means
that
the
loser
in
tuesdays
presidential
contest
will
have
plenty
of
company
in
the
senate
which
is
filled
with
wannabe
executives
another
reason
that
the
path
from
the
senate
to
the
white
house
is
rocky
is
that
wouldbe
presidents
have
amassed
extensive
voting
records
in
the
chamber
that
can
be
easily
picked
apart
on
the
campaign
trail
opponents
can
make
political
hay
out
of
senate
votes
on
contentious
issues
governors
and
other
presidential
aspirants
dont
have
the
same
easytoattack
records
because
of
obamas
limited
time
in
the
senate

he
won
his
seat
in
2004

he
has
had
an
advantage
over
mccain
a
26year
senate
veteran
and
his
main
challenger
in
the
democratic
primaries
sen
hillary
clinton
dny
both
mccain
and
clinton
cast
votes
authorizing
the
use
of
military
force
in
iraq
in
2002

before
obama
arrived
in
the
senate
senators
also
can
struggle
to
explain
the
nuance
of
their
senate
voting
record

especially
votes
that
contradict
each
other
a
senator
who
may
be
able
to
square
a
vote
for
a
proposal
with
a
later
vote
against
a
similar
initiative
may
find
that
impossible
to
explain
on
the
campaign
trail
there
the
vote
change
can
be
used
as
evidence
of
flipflopping
case
in
point
four
years
ago
kerry
was
attacked
for
explaining
a
vote
in
favor
of
war
funding
by
saying
he
voted
for
it
before
voting
against
it
senators
also
are
often
portrayed
on
the
campaign
trail
as
washington
insiders
who
are
too
immersed
in
beltway
politics
to
connect
with
voters
across
the
nation
both
candidates

especially
mccain

would
have
to
broaden
their
expertise
after
years
of
being
immersed
in
a
few
select
areas
serving
on
individual
committees
in
the
senate
a
senatorturnedpresident
may
know
a
lot
about
the
particular
areas
that
he
specialized
in
while
in
the
senate
hess
said
senators
become
very
specialized
which
means
there
are
a
lot
of
areas
in
which
he
steps
into
the
executive
office
of
the
president
in
which
he
knows
nothing
ross
baker
a
political
science
professor
at
rutgers
university
says
that
senators
are
fairly
narrowly
tracked

and
that
leaves
them
illprepared
for
the
juggling
act
required
of
presidents
as
president
you
have
13
responsibilities
coming
at
you
in
terms
of
various
policy
areas
baker
said
a
senator
can
always
say
i
will
check
with
my
staff
and
get
back
to
you
a

do

adriana
rodriguez
and
silverio
silver
salazar
dont
have
much
in
common

clearly
evident
in
their
divergent
choices
for
the
countrys
next
president
but
theyre
both
keenly
aware
of
one
vital
trait
they
share
theyre
hispanic
voters
in
colorado
representing
the
swing
voting
bloc
in
a
battleground
state
that
is
being
intensely
courted
by
both
campaigns
like
millions
of
voters
across
the
country
rodriguez
and
salazar
are
deeply
concerned
about
the
economic
crisis
but
whats
driving
their
political
activism

what
motivates
them
to
work
the
phones
and
knock
on
doors

is
another
issue
that
has
faded
from
the
national
spotlight
but
still

my

shouldnt

salazar
whos
in
charge
of
hispanic
outreach
in
southern
colorado
for
john
mccain
agreed
immigration
is
still
a
crucial
issue
for
us
he
said
some
of
us
have
been
here
for
five
or
six
generations
but
we
still
have
close
ties
with
mexico
a
recent
accident
in
which
an
unauthorized
immigrant
crashed
into
an
aurora
colo
ice
cream
shop
killing
three
including
a
3yearold
has
helped
keep
the
issue
of
illegal
immigration
in
the
forefront
here
but
its
the
lingering
legislative
impasse
in
washington
over
immigration
reform
that
is
inspiring
nonpolitical
types
in
colorado
to
join
the
election
fray
hispanics
are
estimated
to
make
up
nearly
10
percent
of
the
state
electorate
the
hispanic
differential
could
be
the
decisive
factor
said
floyd
ciruli
a
veteran
independent
pollster
in
denver
campaign
officials
state
and
local
leaders
researchers
and
immigrants
all
agreed
that
in
colorado
the
issue
of
immigration
conjures
deep
personal
emotions
that
are
infusing
a
vibrant
political
discourse
activists
pushing
for
a
more
restrictive
immigration
system
link
the
issue
to
economic
troubles
and
national
security
concerns
state
sen
dave
schultheis
has
been
a
leading
proponent
of
new
state
laws
on
illegal
immigration
arguing
that
colorado
leaders
cannot
sit
by
idly
until
their
counterparts
in
washington
get
their
act
together
and
overhaul
the
current
policy
the
latest
census
statistics
show
colorado
is
home
to
nearly
500000
immigrants

about
half
of
them
in
the
country
illegally
according
to
the
federation
for
american
immigration
reform
the
countrys
largest
antiillegalimmigration
organization
people
are
mad
said
schultheis

secondlargest
city
and
a
republican
stronghold
theyre
furious
over
illegals
stealing
jobs
hampering
the
education
system
and
increasing
crime
rates
the
immigrationrestrictionist
argument
in
colorado
is
also
often
linked
to
population
growth
that
is
threatening
quality
of
life
and
the
environment
thats
a
constant
argument
richard
lamm
former
democratic
governor
of
the
state
has
been
making
for
decades
illegal
immigration
is
driving
the
population
explosion
said
lamm
adding
that
the
most
effective
solution
is
to
systematically
punish
employers
who
profit
from
illegal
workers
cheap
labor
is

business
community
said
lamm

effort
many
hispanic
voters
particularly
immigrants
who
have
become
naturalized
citizens
have
not
made
up
their
mind
on
a
candidate
because
theyre
not

2007
we
rented
an
apartment
in
nice
france
from
a
scottish
owner
upon
arrival
at
the
rental
agency
before
the
designated
time
we
had
to
wait
because
the
rental
agent
wasnt
on
site
and
when
she
came
she
had
to
run
an
errand
when
we
were
finally
taken
to
the
apartment
it
hadnt
been
cleaned
there
was
rotting
food
and
mold
in
the
refrigerator
and
no
hot
water
for
over
18
hours
these
things
happen
we
were
told
by
the
rental
agent
the
apartment
was
cleaned
within
the
next
three
hours
but
it
was
a
rocky
start
to
the
week
correspondence
to
the
owner
after
returning
home
was
ignored
the
rental
agent
was
responsible
but
took
no
responsibility
and
offered
no
recompense
thats
not
to
say
that
rental
management
companies
dont
have
fans

have
rented
homes
in

we
would
suggest
only
renting
from
a
professional
management
company
we
have
been
very
disappointed
with
rentals
from
private
individuals
just
remember
your
idea
of
a
clean
house
may
not
coincide
with
their
idea
of
a
clean
house
likewise
rental
management
companies
had
something
to
say
about
the
services
they
provide
mostly
it
seems
a
dose
of
reality
every
owner
believes
his
property
offers
something
special

which
is
the
attitude
you
want
an
owner
to
have

but
the
fact
is
they
sometimes
dont
really
notice
the
barking

the

noise

the

its

if

i
like
to
rent

use

more
likely
to
hear
a
tight
horn
section
than
accordions
the
declining
syncopated
arpeggios
of
a
piano
used
in
a
latin
band
than
a
player
piano
salsa
hiphop
or
reggaeton
than
mazurkas
heading
down
division
street
from
western
avenue
to
the
park
itself
you
pass
beneath
a
row
of
abstract
steel
representations
of
the
puerto
rican
flag
flying
over
the
street
most
of
the
signs
are
in
spanish
the
gentrification
that
has
transformed
the
neighboring
areas
of
wicker
park
bucktown
and
logan
square
is
barely
a
ripple
here
and
yet
the
essential
feel
that
bellow
evokes

a
cozy
cheekbyjowl
urbanity

remains
palpable
the
modest
but
solid
apartment
buildings

three
flats
and
six
flats

lining
the
side
streets
all
across
chicagos
northwest
side
are
snug
and
solid
the
sorts
of
places
that
some
people
use
as
a
first
american
toehold
and
others
never
leave
bellow
referred
to
the
animal
smells
the
rawness
of
chicago
that
struck
him
when
his
family
first
moved
from
lachine
if
the
animal
smells
are
gone

the
huge
union
stockyards
just
southwest
of
humboldt
park
closed
in
the
early
1970s
after
decades
of
decline

chicagos
rough
vitality
remains
stronger
here
than
almost
anywhere
else
in
the
city
the
second
house
into
which
abraham
belo
moved
his
family
is
a
brick
three
flat
on
cortez
street
the
house
is
on
the
ragged
edge
of
ukrainian
village
walking
along
these
streets
youll
hear
ukrainian
russian
and
spanish
with
equal
frequency
some
hipsters
but
not
many
have
started
to
make
inroads
this
far
west
at
the
end
of
bellows
old
block
on
the
corner
of
cortez
and
western
is
a
bar
called
the
empty
bottle
where
the
new
and
old
communities
have
made
a
tentative
accommodation
it
has
an
oldtime
cornertavern
feeling
which
in
this
area
still
tends
to
mean
polish
it
serves
a
largely
latino
community
and
in
the
evenings
it
features
an
eclectic
array
of
experimental
jazz
and
rock
bands
along
with
some
of
the
best
djs
in
the
city
it
achieves
this
mix
matteroffactly
unsentimentally
my
grandmother
and
her
two
sisters
like
bellow
attended
tuley
high
school
in
humboldt
park
he
and
my
greataunt
dorothy
were
almost
exact
contemporaries
and
there
appears
in
more
die
of
heartbreak
a
character
with
their
surname
vilatzer
bellow
spelled
it
vilitzer
the
apocryphal
family
legend
says
that
he
was
fond
of
dorothy
when
they
were
in
high
school
but
her
father
elie
who
owned
a
furniture
store
shooed
the
dreamer
away
bellows
vilitzer
was
the
apotheosis
of
a
corrupt
bigcity
pol

a
caricature
in
a
sense
of
elies
cautious
immigrant
materialism
harold
the
big
heat
vilitzer
was
a
physically
imposing
city
councilman
who
squeezed
a
mans
head
in
a
vise
maneuvered
his
sister
out
of
proceeds
from
a
real
estate
sale
and
shunned
his
nephew
before
climbing
into
the
back
of
a
limousine
perhaps
as
an
act
of
rebellion

bellow
was
pretty
close
to
sainthood
in
my
secular
jewish
home

i
came
to
him
late
not
reading
a
word
of
him
until
i
was
almost
30
i
was
then
in
the
middle
of
a
threeyear
spell
in
london
restless
and
homesick
and
i
picked
up
the
adventures
of
augie
march
less
from
a
burning
desire
to
read
bellow
than
because
the
mere
title
reminded
me
of
home
of
course
it
took
all
of
three
sentences
to
hook
me
the
voice
coming
out
of
those
pages
was
so
strong
so
familiar
and
seemed
to
be
speaking
directly
to
me
i
suppose
all
aesthetic
loves
carry
with
them
a
sense
of
ownership
but
since
then
ive
worked
my
way
through
much
of
the
rest
of
the
canon
and
there
remains
something
categorically
different

both
welcoming
almost
haimishe
and
a
little
eerie

in
my
encounters
with
bellow
than
with
other
authors
i
revere
my
early
memories
are
full
of
characters
i
would
come
to
recognize
or
at
least
call
bellovian
jewish
wiseguys
streetsmart
autodidacts
like
my
grandfather
an
orphan
raised
in
military
school
who
became
first
a
professional
saxophonist
and
then
a
lawyer
who
taught
me
how
to
play
poker
when
i
was
6
my
grandfather
also
read
voraciously
everything
he
could
get
his
hands
on
when
he
came
across
an
unfamiliar
word
he
wrote
it
on
the
books
inside
flap
then
looked
it
up
and
used
it
as
soon
as
he
could
my
grandmother
could
curse
in
yiddish
and
quote
browning
from
memory
with
equal
felicity
art
and
commerce
coexisted
rather
than
competing
in
these
people
and
in
their
milieu
augie
einhorn
and
maurice
spoke
in
their
accents
adenoidal
midwestern
with
an
unerasable
yiddish
twang
all
of
them
were
forged

were
made
americans

in
the
crucible
of
chicagos
northwest
side
their
stories
have
been
reenacted
hundreds
thousands
of
times
over
a
more
fertile
writers
ground
is
difficult
to
imagine
naturally
bellow
wasnt
the
only
writer
patrolling
this
patch
of
earth
nelson
algrens
stories
were
mostly
set
on
the
northwest
side
algren
memorably
described
a
fondness
for
chicago
as
being
like
loving

with
a
broken
nose
you
may
well
find
lovelier

never

always
been
the

main
thoroughfare
it
once
held
more
bars
per
capita
than
any
other
street
in
the
world
today
you
have
to
hunt
around
a
bit
more

the
center
of
drinkinggravity
has
moved
a
bit
east
toward
wicker
park
and
bucktown

but
there
are
still
plenty
of
dark
quiet
spots
for
an
afternoon
beer
and
no
conversation
you
still
see
bars
with
old
style
signs
out
front
advertising
zimne
pivo
polish
for
cold
beer
even
if
the
drinkers
are
speaking
spanish
division
street
also
houses
chicagos
last
remaining
russian
bathhouse
which
inspired
the
greatest
paragraph
of
chicago
anthropology
in
bellows
most
chicagocentric
book
humboldts
gift
the
patrons
of
the
russian
bath
are
cast
in
an
antique
form
they
have
swelling
buttocks
and
fatty
breasts
as
yellow
as
buttermilk
they
stand
on
thick
pillar
legs
affected
with
a
sort
of
creeping
verdigris
or
bluecheese
mottling
of
the
ankles
after
steaming
these
old
fellows
eat
enormous
snacks
of
bread
and
salt
herring
or
large
ovals
of
salami
and
dripping
skirtsteak
and
they
drink
schnapps
they
could
knock
down
walls
with
their
hard
stout
oldfashioned
bellies
things
are
very
elementary
here
you
feel
that
these
people
are
almost
conscious
of
obsolescence
of
a
line
of
evolution
abandoned
by
nature
and
culture
so
down
in
the
superheated
subcellars
all
these
slavonic
cavemen
and
wood
demons
with
hanging
laps
of
fat
and
legs

boil
themselves
and
splash
ice
water
on
their
heads
by
the
bucket
upstairs
on
the
television

in
the
locker
room
little
dudes
and
grinning
broads
make
smart
talk
or
leap
up
and
down
they
are
unheeded

there
may
be
no
village
in
the
carpathians
where
such
practices
still
prevail
if
my
grandfather
didnt
eat
red
meat
every
day
of
his
87
years
he
came
pretty
close
their
house
always
smelled
like
roast
beef
and
garlic
from
time
spent
on
the
floor
as
a
child
i
can
confirm
it
worked
itself
into
the
very
fibers
of
the
shag
carpet
and
me
as
much
as
i
love
a
good
shvitz
it
has
an
antique
almost
kitsch
feel
to
it
in
that
paragraph
i
fear
that
i
am
at
best
the
little
dude
making
smart
talk
and
going

i
dont
feel
terrible
about
it

makes

of
where
to

hes
in

foxs
latest
recommendation
the
flat
pasta
with
braised
rabbit
at
kefi
a
small
greek
restaurant
on
the
upper
west
side
that
will
soon
move
to
a
bigger
space
it
feels
like
one
of
the
local
places
he
said
standing
outside
the
metropolitan
museum
of
art
about
two
weeks
ago
its
not
in
a
place
a
tourist
would
just
be
walking
by
i
like
feeling
like
an
insider
its
an
excellent
tip
kefi
is
a
gem
known
to
upper
west
siders
and
foodobsessed
new
yorkers
but
way
off
the
tourist
track
it
turns
out
you
can
make
quite
a
weekend
plan
by
simply
asking
a
dozen
visitors
from
everywhere
from
bulgaria
to
vancouver
to
share
the
highlight
of
their
own
trips
then
cobbling
those
together
it
might
even
yield
better
results
than
alas
reading
a
travel
columnist
whod
like
to
think
he
knows
what
visitors
will
like
but
has
perhaps
become
a
bit
blase
by
living
in
the
city
the
recommendation
by
foxs
wife
barbara
was
a
bit
dicier
than
the
restaurant
pick
her
favorite
activity
was
buying
knockoff
purses
in
backrooms
of
canal
street
stores
weekend
in
new
york
does
not
endorse
such
activity
but
did
not
want
to
restrict
her
freedom
of
speech
so
will
note
that
she
got
a
3400
louis
vuitton
purse
or
something
like
one
for
80
a
young
couple
from
zaragoza
spain
said
that
what
made
their
trip
was
the
decision
to
stay
in
the
st
marks
hotel
in
the
east
village
as
opposed
to
a
more
traditional
midtown
location
the
st
marks
is
not
a
grand
hotel
said
jesus
longares
a
32yearold
engineer
but
it
is
in
a
fascinating
area
there
are
many
contrasts
you
can
see
a
store
specializing
in
comics
and
then
a
boutique
for
goths
sometimes
popular
destinations
yield
unexpected
highlights
mircea
bucecu
and
gwen
groom
who
were
visiting
from
vancouver
recommended
ground
zero
but
not
for
the
typical
reasons
they
were
chilled
and
touched
not
so
much
by
the
site
itself
but
by
the
nearsilence
of
their
fellow
visitors
i
couldnt
believe
that
said
bucecu

usually
its
a
noisy
town
if
someone
was
talking
they
were
whispering
groom

cited
another
characteristic
new
york
is
not
known
for
there
was
a
sense
of
humbleness
there
she
said
most
travelers
had
to
ponder
their
decision
a
bit
but
not
vasco
krapchev
krapchev
a
seasoned
traveler
and
molecular
virologist
who
was
born
in
bulgaria
and
lives
in
poland
recently
spent
four
days
visiting
a
childhood
friend
in
new
york
his
call
drinking
at
ideya
a
cozy
bar
and
restaurant
serving
modern
latin
cuisine
in
soho
he
recommended
the
bar
scene
between
10
pm
and
midnight
on
friday
or
saturday
nights
great
mojitos
and
caipirinhas
he
said
top
10
of
where
ive
been
for
sure
maybe
top
five
note
a
vigorous
test
of
his
recommendation
proved
he
was
on
the
mark
he
was
not
impressed
with
the
food
although
he
may
have
drunk
too
much
to
taste
it
as
evidenced
by
his
difficulty
in
recalling
how
long
he
stayed
in
the
end
he
resorted
to
an
alternative
form
of
measurement
we
spent
four
caipirinhas
there
he
said
so
probably
three
hours
thais
mucher
a
brazilian
woman
traveling
with
her
sister
juliana

both
in
their
20s

was
amazed
that
in
new
york
she
could
eat
tapas
under
such
elegant
lighting
at
pipa
during
the
day
its
a
store
that
sells
crystal
chandeliers
she
said

thats
abc
carpet
ampamp
home
at
night
they
put
in
tables
its
really
awesome
the
dozens
of
chandeliers
hanging
from
the
ceiling

along
with
the
mirrors
on
the
wall

are
for
sale
the
sisters
mucher
werent
tempted
they
stuck
with
the
sangria
her
sister
fell
into
another
category
of
traveler
those
who
recommended
things
new
yorkers
and
frequent
visitors
take
for
granted
in
her
case
it
was
the
concept
of
brunch
in
sao
paulo
its
just
lunch
she
said
here
brunch
is
really
delicious
she
recommended
the
beef
sandwich
with
caramelized
onions
and
gruyere
at
bistro
citron
on
the
upper
west
side
in
the
same
category
was
peggy
minnich
from
ventura
county
california
who
was
with
her
husband
richard
her
simple
recommendation
the
subway
as
tourist
attraction
coming
from
la
she
said
we
dont
have
public
transportation
its
an
experience
in
and
of
itself
it
connects
you
to
the
city
in
a
way
that
nothing
else
does
richard
minnich
was
slightly
less
complimentary
calling
the
subway
filthy
use
the
word
earthy
perhaps
peggy
minnich
said
the
recommendation
of
trish
and
chris
skillman
who
were
in
town
for
the
weekend
from
clinton
nj
with
their
14yearold
heather
and
her
friend
lauren
folsom
was
not
to
plan
at
all
i
would
come
in
with
absolutely
nothing
particular
in
mind
and
just
pick
and
choose
as
the
mood
strikes
said
chris
skillman
almost
nothing
in
mind
that
is
every
time
they
visit
heather
insists
that
they
go
to

though

the

underscores
the
enduring
challenge
in
deciphering
this
country
music
pioneer
more
than
five
decades
after
his
death
in
1953
of
an
overdose
of
morphine
on
his
way
to
play
a
show
hank
williams
lives
on
in
myth
that
is
so
fraught
with
melodrama

the
liquor
and
pills
heartache
and
gloom

and
so
calcified
by
decades
of
redaction
and
hype
that
its
almost
impossible
to
tell
the
singer
of
lost
highway
from
his
songs
but
two
recent
projects
help
recast
him
in
a
revealing
new
light
without
whitewashing
the
intemperance
and
scandal
the
first
an
exhibition
at
the
country
music
hall
of
fame
and
museum
here
features
family
artifacts
that
have
never
been
displayed
in

before
the

a
cd
boxset
called
the
unreleased
recordings
is
the
first
installment
of
unearthed
radio
transcriptions
to
be
issued
by
time
life
far
from
presenting
this
archetypical
singersongwriter
as
ghostly
or
morose
the
exhibition
and
boxset
leave
the
impression
of
a
devout
man
who
despite
debilitating
health
and
personal
problems
loved
his
family
and
liked
nothing
so
much
as
a
good
prank
you
talk
about
pulling
practical
jokes

him
and
the
band
thats
all
they
did
said
hank
williams
jr
59
in
an
interview
at
his
customized
rv
here
this
summer
he
also
owns
several
residences
were
talking
about
a
bunch
of
20yearold
guys
he
continued
referring
to
his
fathers
band
the
drifting
cowboys
he
would
sign
autographs
and
they
would
come
up
behind
him
with
a
stink
bomb
the
exhibition
family
tradition
the
williams
family
legacy
depicts
the
lives
of
three
generations
from
hank
and
his
wife
audrey
to
hank
jrs
five
children
and
features
items
like
the
1944
martin
d28
guitar
on
which
williams
wrote
many
of
his
hits
the
scotchtaped
scrapbooks
that
hanks
mother
kept
during
his
rise
to
fame
are
presented
alongside
touchscreen
recreations
of
their
contents
there
are
candid
family
photos
from
the
late
1940s
home
movies
of
a
trip
to
disneyland
and

later
of

the
singer
jett
williams
hank
srs
daughter
from
his
brief
affair
with
bobbie
jett
is
also
a
subject
of
the
exhibition
originally
preserved
on
16inch
acetate
discs
the
143
transcriptions
included
in
the
unreleased
recordings

the
first
54
of
which
were
released
last
week

nearly
double
hank
williams
recorded
output
the
music
was
rescued
from
a
dumpster
in
the
late
1980s
by
an
employee
of
wsmam
the
nashville
radio
station
on
which
the
songs
were
originally
broadcast
on
an
early
morning
program
sponsored
by
mothers
best
flour
company
in
1951
the
decision
about
what
should
be
done
with
the
transcriptions
was
delayed
by
protracted
litigation
over
the
williams
estate
the
recordings
greatly
expand
what
we
know
of
williams
persona
and
repertory
we
hear
him
not
only
exulting
in
the
pleasures
of
making
music
but
also
clowning
with
his
band
and
crooning
old
hymns
like
softly
and
tenderly
and
victorian
parlor
ballads
like
the
blind
childs
prayer
what
the
mothers
best
flour
shows
reveal
is
that
hank
was
a
fully
fleshedout
man
with
a
silly
sense
of
humor
deep
religious
faith
and
a
sentimental
side
that
comes
off
as
borderline
cheesy
today
said
brenda
colladay
curator
of
the
grand
ole
opry
museum
in
nashville
this
isnt
the
tortured
tragic
genius
who
died
in
the
back
seat
of
a
cadillac
this
is
the
hank
who
cant
quite
believe
he
is
playing
on
wsm
radio
has
a
closet
full
of
custom
suits
a
string
of
hit
records
and
a
beautiful
blond
wife
sitting
next
to
him
as
he
steers
that
cadillac
toward
his
dream
house
in
one
touching
betweensong
segment
williams
promises
young
bocephus

his
nickname
for
hank
jr

that
hell
be
home
for
breakfast
to
sop
biscuits
with
him
williams
had
just
reached
new
heights
in
popularity
including
appearances
on
national
television
programs
like
the
perry
como
show
and
being
billed
above
bob
hope
and
milton
berle
on
the
touring
hadacol
caravan
nevertheless
the
eagerness
in
his
voice
at
the
prospect
of
being
home
with
his
family
is
palpable
hank
jr
was
only
3
12
when
his
father
died
and
he
remembers
little
of
their
time
together
nearly
eight
years
his
senior
hank
jrs
halfsister
lycrecia
williams
hoover
has
more
firsthand
memories
of
what
williams
was
like
of
the
two
of
us
i
always
considered
myself
the
luckiest
one
because
i
got
to
do
things
with
daddy
said
hoover
67
a
dignified
woman
with
intense
blue
eyes
a
stayathome
mom
much
of
her
life

spoke
from
the

of
her
home
in
rural

about
40
miles
from

daddy

a
fun
person
she
said
he
would
take
me
bowling
a
lot
he
would
go
horseback
riding
and
fishing
with
me
i
just
feel
like
hank

missed
out
on
so
much
audrey
williams
daughter
from
an
earlier
marriage
hoover
wasnt
enthusiastic
about
the
prospect
of
another
retrospective
about
her
stepfather
when
representatives
of
the
museum
in
nashville
contacted
her
about
the
project
she
doesnt
shy
away
from
talking
about
her
parents
fussing
and
fighting
or
about
hanks
darker
side
or
drinking
she
was
however
wary
of
yet
another
tabloid
treatment
of
the
williams
legacy
they
said
we
promise
you
this
is
not
going
to
be
like
the
others
she
said
particularly
welcome
hoover
said
is
the
museums
depiction
through
telegrams
and
other
documents
of
her
mothers
career
as
a
businesswoman
audrey
married
hank
in
1944
at
a
gas
station
near
andalusia
ala
after
playing
a
critical
role
in
helping
her
husband
start
his
career
audrey
a
performer
who
has
often
been
portrayed
as
conniving
and
shrill
went
on
to
become
a
successful
song
publisher
and
movie
producer
in
1964
she
was
a
founder
of
audlee

nashvilles
oldest
privately
owned
talent
agency
now
called

had
it
not
been
for

i
just
dont
think
daddy
would
have
gotten
to
nashville
unless
somebody
else
could
of
got
a
hold
of
him
and
pushed
hoover
said
daddy
he
liked
to
entertain
he
was
a
genius
but
mother
was
the
mastermind
behind
getting
him
where
he
needed
to
be
carolyn
tate
the
curator
with
michael
mccall
of
the
family
tradition
exhibition
stresses
the
importance
of
putting
audreys
accomplishments
in
historical
context
she
was
a
single
mom
in
the
mid50s
tate
said
she
was
left
to
run
a
business
and
raise
children
and
to
deal
with
a
lot
of
legal
issues
despite
her
business
acumen
audrey
died
bankrupt
in
1975
after
years
of
struggling
with
addiction
to
alcohol
and
other
drugs
after
daddy
passed
away
mother
blamed
herself
hoover
said
she
loved
him
and
felt
like
she
should
have
been
able
to
keep
him
from
drinking
later
little
by
little
she
began
to
drink
until
she
became
an
alcoholic
too
audrey
and
hank
williams
divorced
in
july
1952
less
than
six
months
before
hanks
death
the
exhibition
also
plots
lesserknown
points
in
the
trajectory
of
hank
jrs
career
initially
cast
as
his
fathers
imitator
hank
jr
transformed
himself
into
a
raucous
countryrocker
fusing
his
fathers
bluessteeped
honkytonk
with
disparate
influences
to
create
a
new
southern
hybrid
to
see
me
at
13
and
14
years
old
with
the
wavy
jellyroll
hair
and
the
white
stratocaster
it
all
comes
together
said
hank
jr
who
was
born
randall
hank
williams
recalling
his
days
leading
a
combo
called
rockin
randall
and
the
rockets
id
go
out
on
the
road
and
be
hank
williams
sr
and
come
back
home
and
be
rockin
randall
thats
how
i
would
do
it

two
worlds
and
guess
what
rockin
randall
consumed
the
other
guy
my
cloning
days
were
over
hank
jrs
son
hank
williams
iii
born
shelton
hank
williams
35
has
felt
the
burden
of
his
birthright
too
in
his
case
this
has
meant
pressure
to
differentiate
himself
not
just
from
his
father
but
also
from
his
grandfather
to
whom
he
bears
an
uncanny
physical
and
vocal
resemblance
im
almost
following
in
the
same
footsteps
as
my
dad
but
instead
of
skynyrd
ive
been
into
pantera
and
david
allan
coe
and
bands
like
that
he
said
of
his
assortment
of
country
punk
and
heavy
metal
the
energys
just
different
the
most
emblematic
items
in
the
exhibition
from
hank
iiis
career
are
his
ducttaped
cowboy
boots
hank
iii
whose
album
damn
right
rebel
proud
curb
records
was
released
on
oct
21
estimates
that
before
loaning
them
to
the
museum
he
had
worn
them
for
as
many
as
4000
consecutive
performances
cropping
up
again
and
again
in
the
exhibition
is
the
struggle
of
williams
family
members
to
define
themselves
as
inheritors
of
hank
srs
legacy
while
also
striving
to
preserve
some
semblance
of
normality
most
telling
is
a
photo
from
the
late
50s
in
which
hoover
and
her
brother
and
mother
are
playing
in
the
snow
in
front
of
their
ranchstyle
home
in
nashville
people
dont
understand
that
part

a
kid
with
his
sister
and
his
mother
hank
jr
said
referring
to
the
scene
in
the
photo
its
real
normal
yeah
until
this
big
bus
comes
by
with
all
these
tourists
and
as
this
little
bitty
kid
i
think
why
are
they
stopping
there
and
then
it
hits
you
thats
why
theyre
stopping
there
it
took
two
years
of
highlevel
negotiations
to
arrange
a
meeting
with
daniel
craig
in
an
era
when
mi6

the
agency
that
employs
his
bestknown
character
james
bond

blithely
advertises
for
agents
on
the
internet
craig
may
well
be
the
worlds
most
elusive
pretend
spy
the
long
wait
allowed
plenty
of
time
for
disturbing
rumors
to
marinate
for
instance
he
is
surly
and
defensive
a
reporteraverse
utterer
of
combative
monosyllables
or
this
from
two
women
working
on
his
publicity
he
has
more
sexual
magnetism
than
anyone
we
have
ever
met
perhaps
nothing
short
of
craigs
materializing
in
his
snug
powderblue
bathing
trunks
from
casino
royale
and
offering
to
shake
the
martinis
himself
could
have
realistically
lived
up
to
all
that
anticipation
but
there
he
was
in
jeans
his
arm
in
a
sling
from
recent
shoulder
surgery
he
was
wearing
a
thick
cardigan
that
truth
be
told
walked
a
sensitive
line
between
doofusy
and
stylish
he
was
of
course
unfairly
attractive
anyway
in
his
craggy
livedin
blueeyed
way
but
not
so
much
as
to
render
anyone
speechless
or
unable
to
operate
a
notebook
he
was
polite
to
a
fault
he
stood
up
when
his
publicists
assistant
brought
in
a
cup
of
tea
he
apologized
several
times
for
being
five
minutes
late
he
acted
as
if
he
were
not
sitting
in
a
soulless
conference
room
which
he
was
and
as
if
he
had
all
day
to
chat
about
bond
and
other
interesting
topics
which
he
didnt
he
had
an
hour
unlike
many
movie
stars
who
come
to
believe
the
myth
of
their
superiority
craig
40
tends
to
mock
his
own
celebrity
now
that
he
is
too
famous
to
go
to
the
movies
without
being
recognized
he
said
he
might
be
forced
to
install
a
screening
room
at
home
not
i
could
stick
it
next
to
the
indoor
swimming
pool
he
said
sarcastically
passing
beneath
two
celebratory
posters
of
himself
as
james
bond
in
his
publicists
office
here
he
grimaced
and
muttered
thats
my
dorian
gray
portrait
asked
whether
he
saw
himself
as
a
natural
leading
man
he
said
fat
chance
and
then
theres
not
a
skincare
product
in
the
world
that
would
have
made
that
happen
for
me
when
he
was
cast
as
bond
filling
the
position
most
recently
vacated
by
pierce
brosnan
craig
did
not
seem
like
an
obvious
choice
he
was
an
actors
actor
known
for
his
intensity
of
focus
and
his
wide
range
of
challenging
counterintuitive
roles
he
has
played
among
other
things
a
sharplapeled
pornography
baron
from
manchester
in
the
bbc
miniseries
our
friends
in
the
north
a
college
professor
pursued
by
a
male
stalker
in
enduring
love
a
builder
sleeping
with
his
girlfriends
sexagenarian
mother
in
the
mother
a
drugdealing
businessman
in
layer
cake
a
killer
full
of
murderous
rage
and
heartbreaking
tenderness
in
infamous
and
the
poet
ted
hughes
in
sylvia
everybody
said
oh
arent
you
afraid
youll
be
typecast

he
recalled
of
taking
the
bond
role
and
i
said
of
course
i
am
but
if
it
has
to
be
this

well
thats
not
too
bad
traditionalists
were
appalled
the
british
tabloids
whose
writers
possibly
had
not
seen
craig
in
his
other
films
sniped
that
he
was
too
short
too
blond
too
actory
too
potentially
lazenbyesque
they
spread
the
rumor
that
he
didnt
know
how
to
drive
a
stick
shift
let
alone
one
attached
to
an
aston
martin
but
from
the
first
scene
in
casino
royale
2006
in
which
bond
brutally
kills
a
man
with
his
bare
hands
and
then
coolly
shoots
and
kills
his
own
corrupt
boss
craig
proved
to
be
a
rare
combination
of
plausibility
physicality
and
charisma
he
got
rave
reviews
and
not
just
from
bonds
traditional
fan
base
the
latest
movie
quantum
of
solace
which
opens
nov
14
is
full
of
the
usual
bondian
big
guns
big
explosions
bigbusted
women
and
big
improbable
hightestosterone
stunts
many
of
them
performed
by
craig
while
he
bulked
up
for
casino

he
wanted
to
look
as
if
he
could
kill
people
just
by
looking
at
them
his
personal
trainer
a
former
royal
navy
commando
said
recently

in
this
film
he
focused
on
building
up
his
stamina
going
for
lean
and
mean
over
brawn
craig
was
recently
quoted
in
the
times
of
london
as
saying
i
am
not
an
athlete
although
i
have
always
enjoyed
keeping
fit
between
bouts
of
minor
alcoholism
craig
said
that
he
had
been
determined
to
ensure
that
the
story
made
logical
and
emotional
sense
quantum
begins
moments
after
casino
ends
with
bond
wielding
an
enormous
firearm
on
the
island
where
he
has
just
shot
one
of
the
men
responsible
for
the
death
of
vesper
lynd
the
treacherous
love
of
his
life
theyre
two
separate
movies
but
if
you
were
to
punish
yourself
by
watching
them
back
to
back
youd
see
a
through
line
craig
said
he
particularly
wanted
bond
to
have
to
contend
with
the
emotional
repercussions
of
vespers
death
it
was
very
important
that
we
deal
with
that
he
said
i
just
felt
that
you
cant
have
a
character
fall
in
love
so
madly
as
they
did
in
the
last
movie
and
not
finish
it
off
understand
it
get
some
closure
thats
why
the
movie
is
called
quantum
of
solace

thats
exactly
what
hes
looking
for
he
added
by
the
end
of
solace
theres
a
conclusion
that
im
hoping
will
set
us
up
if
all
goes
well
for
a
third
movie
and
we
can
set
it
someplace
warm
and
quiet
he
was
kidding
he
said
about
the
quiet
part
last
fall
he
and
the
director
of
quantum
of
solace
marc
forster
set
out
to
fill
in
the
gaps
in
the
script
left
incomplete
because
of
the
hollywood
writers
strike
forster
said
he
was
struck
by
how
much
craig
wanted
to
get
the
story
right
and
ensure
that
his
interpretation
of
bond
was
not
just
a
cliche
but
a
character
that
people
can
connect
to
he
added
hes
very
shy
and
slightly
modest
and
humble
and
he
doesnt
like
to
be
the
center
of
attention
its
more
like
lets
make
good
movies
and
tell
a
good
story
and
do
a
good
job

along
with
quantum
craig
is
appearing
this
fall
in
defiance
set
to
open
dec
31
based
on
the
true
story
of
the
bielskis
a
trio
of
freedomfighting
jewish
brothers
in
world
war
ii
defying
the
nazis
and
the
odds
they
set
up
an
unlikely
community
of
tough
armed
refugees
in
the
punishing
belarussian
forest
craig
plays
tuvia
their
complicated
leader

sometimes
hotheaded
sometimes
coolly
rational
now
seeking
revenge
now
preaching
restraint
the
shoot
was
tough
the
actors
had
to
speak
russian
in
a
number
of
scenes
they
also
had
to
live
more
or
less
in
the
woods
in
sometimes
extreme
frigid
conditions
for
three
months
most
of
the
cast
came
down
with
some
sort
of
bronchial
flu
craig
said
but
when
we
started
drinking
more
it
seemed
to
get
better
the
director
of
defiance
edward
zwick
said
it
was
interesting
to
watch
craig
take
on
the
role
with
all
its
ambivalence
and
inner
conflict
in
tandem
with
playing
the
selfassured
bond
you
see
very
clearly
his
ambition
as
an
actor
he
refuses
to
be
just
one
thing
zwick
said
in
a
telephone
interview
what
you
have
to
understand
about
daniel
is
that
he
is
a
working
actor
who
considers
himself
that
he
began
in
the
theater
and
did
all
sorts
of
ensemble
work
and
in
some
ways
this
was
a
territory
in
which
hes
more
comfortable
than
in
being
the
star
whos
out
in
front
of
the
movie
craig
grew
up
in
liverpool
and
spent
much
of
his
spare
time
watching
movies
sometimes
by
himself
in
a
small
cinema
down
the
street
from
his
house
he
left
home
as
a
teenager
to
seek
his
fortune
as
an
actor
in
london
he
worked
with
the
national
youth
theater
went
to
drama
school
and
began
being
cast
as
romantic
leads
a
designation
he
brushes
aside
with
each
part
he
explained
i
said
to
myself
romantic
lead

what
is
he
is
he
an
alcoholic
whats
his
deal
whats
his
problem
for
me
that
has
always
been
the
way
thats
what
i
did
for
bond
and
what
i
try
and
do
with
everything
he
is
determined
to
continue
pursuing
extrabond
roles
ive
been
so
fortunate
to
land
this
amazing
role
in
a
huge
franchise
he
said
its
set
me
up
in
a
really
good
way
for
life
and
thats
wonderful
but
i
love
acting
and
i
genuinely
think
its
an
important
part
of
what
life
is
about
i
get
a
kick
out
of
it
and
im
not
good
at
sitting
around
craig
who
has
a
teenage
daughter
from
an
early
marriage
genuinely
seems
more
interested
in
talking
about
other
topics

the
books
of
philip
pullman
the
excitingtohim
proposition
of
barack
obama
being
elected
president
movies
he
likes

than
he
does
in
talking
about
himself
but
he
mentioned
his
longtime
american
girlfriend
satsuki
mitchell
with
whom
he
lives
in
los
angeles
and
london
he
wears
a
silver
necklace
inscribed
with
a
quotation
about
taking
your
heart
wherever
you
go
he
said
when
asked
sounding
suddenly
shy
recently
he
said
the
two
drove
up
the
american
west
coast
through
to
the
pacific
northwest
they
ducked
into
a
smalltown
movie
theater
to
see
the
guillermo
del
toro
movie
hellboy
ii
the
golden
army
someone
approached
craig
has
anyone
ever
told
you
you
look
like
daniel
craig
the
man
asked
no
craig
answered
and
walked
on
the
details
dont
really
matter
what
matters
is
that
a
few
years
before
his
screenplays
for
the
queen
and
the
last
king
of
scotland
propelled
him
to
the
head
of
the
class
peter
morgan
was
so
fed
up
that
he
was
ready
to
try
anything

anything

that
wasnt
a
film
script
he
considered
bungee
jumping
and
mountain
climbing
he
said
not
long
ago
from
his
home
in
london
but
he
chose
something
even
riskier
he
wrote
a
play
about
the
landmark
1977
television
interviews
that
david
frost
conducted
with
richard
m
nixon
relying
on
the
accounts
of
participants
and
fictionalizing
here
and
there
for
effect
he
made
sure
to
write
it
he
said
in
a
way
that
breaks
every
single
rule
of
screenwriting
frostnixon
was
picked
up
by
the
small
but
prestigious
donmar
warehouse
where
the
director
michael
grandage
and
the
designer
christopher
oram
incorporated
onstage
video
screens
to
allow
closeups
of
michael
sheens
unctuous
eagerbeaver
frost
and
frank
langellas
sly
subtly
decomposing
nixon
morgan
loved
the
effect
but
he
recalled
it
gave
him
pause
i
hope
people
dont
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
this
has
any
sort
of
filmic
life
in
it
whatsoever
that
was
then
now
for
all
of
morgans
determination
to
make
it
impossible
frostnixon
the
movie
is
scheduled
to
open
on
dec
5
right
in
time
for
the
hollywood
awards
season
directed
by
ron
howard
whose
previous
forays
into
20thcentury
history
include
the
oscarwinning
beautiful
mind
and
the
oscarnominated
apollo
13
the
film
retains
the
stage
productions
acclaimed
star
performances
its
often
verbatim
recreations
of
interviews
that
ranged
from
droning
wonkishness
to
highstakes
drama
and
its
eerily
familiar
litany
of
military
disasters
abroad
and
assertions
of
presidential
power
at
home
morgan
never
intended
to
write
a
play
about
george
w
bush
the
iraq
war
and
government
spying
he
said
frostnixon
had
been
gestating
since
1993
and
when
he
realized
that
people
were
seeing
inferences
and
parallels
he
went
back
to
the
play
and
threw
stuff
out
im
thrilled
that
it
has
a
contemporary
resonance
he
said
but
id
be
perfectly
happy
if
it
didnt
i
didnt
want
the
frostnixon
play
to
be
seen
as
a
metaphor
for
bushblair
i
hate
when
im
an
audience
member
and
im
being
led
because
why
write
about
bush
when
you
can
write
about
nixon
it
would
be
hard
to
overstate
the
hold
richard
m
nixon
still
exerted
on
the
public
imagination
in
1977
when
david
frost
paid
him
1
million
ultimately
to
sit
in
front
of
a
television
camera
and
answer
questions
at
last
about
the
reasons
behind
his
ignominious
resignation
in
1974
with
a
cobbledtogether
production
team
an
oddly
assorted
collection
of
sponsors
and
an
ad
hoc
network
of
independent
stations
frost
pulled
off
a
coup
at
once
historic
journalistic
and
financial
the
first
installment
of
what
eventually
became
a
fivepart
package
was
seen
by
an
astounding
45
million
viewers
the
same
number
noted
john
j
oconnor
television
critic
for
the
new
york
times
who
sat
down
every
week
to
watch
happy
days
the
hit
sitcom
starring
a
young
actor
named
ron
howard
still
theres
no
question
that
the
resounding
success
of
frostnixon
was
due
in
part
to
its
implicit
analogy
between
the
misdeeds
that
drove
nixon
from
power
and
more
recent
events
and
even
before
the
play
moved
from
the
donmar
to
the
west
end
morgan
was
besieged
by
directors

including
martin
scorsese
george
clooney
and
sam
mendes

wanting
to
turn
it
into
a
film
i
had
these
mixed
emotions
he
said
i
thought
on
the
one
hand
all
the
people
i
most
admire
in
the
world
seem
to
be
interested
but
the
secret
that
i
cant
share
with
any
of
them
is
as
a
mechanic
the
motor
wont
work
the
car
is
not
roadworthy
when
howard
first
heard
about
the
play
he
said
it
didnt
immediately
suggest
a
movie
to
him
either
but
i
was
surprised
when
i
read
it
and
even
more
compelled
by
the
performance
i
saw
at
the
donmar
he
remembered
i
just
had
a
connection
with
the
material
and
a
feeling
about
how
to
adapt
it
i
just
wanted
to
do
it
howards
partner
at
imagine
entertainment
brian
grazer
was
also
tentative
at
first
after
30
years
of
being
a
producer
he
said
i
never
know
but
he
was
intrigued
by
morgans
portrait
of
two
opposites

the
humbled
illatease
expresident
and
the
ambitious
charming
talkshow
host

both
exploiting
television
to
further
their
own
ends
morgan
went
with
howard
as
director
partly
because
he
thought
howards
track
record
would
reassure
skittish
moviegoers
that
frostnixon
would
be
entertaining
an
indication
of
just
how
skittish
they
might
be
morgan
said
was
the
difficulty
of
enticing
people
into
test
screenings
if
you
go
into
a
mall
and
say
would
you
like
to
come
and
see
a
film
about
the
interviews
done
by
david
frost
and
richard
nixon
in
1977
he
noted
they
just
walk
past
you
they
think
youre
mad
because
frostnixon
would
be
a
hard
sell
a
bigtime
movie
star
for
the
juicy
role
of
nixon
seemed
an
inevitability
for
langella
who
had
by
his
own
admission
struggled
to
find
his
way
into
the
character
it
was
disappointing
but
not
surprising
the
story
out
there
is
that
i
was
waiting
and
waiting
and
waiting
langella
said
but
he
knew
even
before
the
production
moved
from
the
donmar
to
the
west
end
that
the
role
would
be
going
to
jack
nicholson
he
said
and
by
the
time
langella
was
on
broadway
en
route
to
the
best
actor
tony
award
he
knew
warren
beatty
would
be
nixon
on
film
i
had
accepted
the
fact
that
i
wasnt
going
to
play
him
langella
said
meanwhile
the
producers
were
coming
to
the
opposite
conclusion
when
you
start
with
a
blank
canvas
said
eric
fellner
of
working
title
films
the
coproducer
of
frostnixon
you
think
there
are
many
other
ways
of
going
but
by
the
time
the
decision
actually
had
to
be
made
it
was
quite
clear
there
were
no
other
ways
of
going
the
plan
had
always
been
to
cast
sheen
who
had
so
memorably
played
tony
blair
in
the
queen
and
howard
said
there
had
never
been
any
doubt
in
his
own
mind
that
langella
would
be
great
ultimately
he
said
it
became
quite
apparent
that
anyone
else
doing
the
role
would
be
walking
in
franks
shadow
but
there
were
other
problems
morgans
play
had
all
those
uncinematic
elements
he
had
taken
such
pains
to
incorporate
there
were
two
narrators
aides
to
the
title
characters
speaking
directly
to
the
audience
there
was
a
plotline
wholly
dependent
on
the
progress
of
the
interviews
themselves
that
developed
largely
in
a
single
room
and
the
storys
climax

the
wishedfor
admission
from
nixon
that
yes
he
had
let
the
american
people
down

came
with
the
two
antagonists
immobilized
in
matching
easy
chairs
howard
was
not
concerned
i
think
the
tight
quarters
and
the
intensity
particularly
in
the
second
half
are
a
huge
dramatic
asset
he
said
citing
his
experience
making
the
even
more
claustrophobic
apollo
13
and
i
felt
that
there
were
ways
of
opening
it
up
that
didnt
have
anything
to
do
with
scope
and
scale
expanding
it
through
detail
through
broadening
the
secondary
characters
through
utilizing
the
television
medium
and
just
through
the
camerawork
and
the
editing
another
touchstone
was
howards
cinderella
man
about
the
boxer
james
braddock
i
realized
how
much
could
be
divulged
through
the
reaction
of
the
people
in
the
corners
to
inhabit
those
corners
he
cast
a
constellation
of
firstclass
actors
kevin
bacon
plays
jack
brennan
the
staunch
military
aide
who
followed
nixon
from
the
white
house
to
become
his
chief
of
staff
in
california
on
the
opposing
side
are
sam
rockwell
as
james
reston
jr
frosts
impassioned
researcher
for
the
watergate
segment
oliver
platt
as
bob
zelnick
the
hardnosed
reporter
researching
the
other
interview
topics
and
matthew
macfadyen
as
john
birt
the
programs
skilled
british
producer
in
the
play
brennan
and
reston
provide
running
commentary
as
frost
and
nixon
arrange
for
combat
and
then
go
mano
a
mano
morgan
thought
the
dueling
narrators
would
have
to
be
dropped
from
the
movie
howard
suggested
augmenting
brennan
and
reston
with
even
more
narrators
all
recounting
their
recollections
for
a
television
documentary
of
course
those
recollections
dont
exactly
match
the
memories
of
the
actual
players
in
the
drama
frost
whose
current
interview
program
frost
over
the
world
runs
on
aljazeera
english
scoffed
at
his
characterization
as
a
lightweight
celebritychaser
ticking
off
a
long
list
of
the
presidents
and
prime
ministers
he
had
already
interviewed
when
he
took
on
nixon
ken
khachigian
the
lead
researcher
for
the
nixon
team
which
included
a
young
diane
sawyer
echoed
that
point
we
viewed
frost
as
a
tough
adversary
he
said
we
did
our
homework
theres
a
picture
in
my
office
of
our
briefing
books

about
30
or
35
briefing
books
piled
high
on
nixons
desk
khachigian
and
brennan
both
take
issue
with
morgans
most
fanciful
invention
the
scene
in
which
a
drunken
nixon
calls
frost
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
confides
a
secret
anguish
he
was
not
capable
of
holding
drinks
brennan
said
of
nixon
he
knew
that
any
time
we
went
to
a
party
for
example
i
would
tell
the
bartender
if
one
of
his
big
buddies
comes
over
and
says
he
wants
a
scotch
for
dick
nixon
just
give
him
blond
dubonnet
brennan
said
he
told
morgan
you
could
have
made
your
point
without
the
presumption
of
alcoholism
reston
who
had
provided
morgan
with
a
30yearold
account
of
his
time
on
the
frost
team
now
published
as
the
conviction
of
richard
nixon
was
somewhat
surprised
by
his
portrayal
as
a
hot
young
radical
i
was
the
quiet
one
who
did
all
the
work
he
said
like
brennan
he
hadnt
yet
seen
the
movie
though
both
men
had
met
with
and
been
impressed
by
their
film
surrogates
before
shooting
began
as
for
zelnick
when
he
met
his
screen
counterpart
he
said
he
advised
the
muchtaller
platt
to
play
him
on
his
knees
morgan
makes
no
apologies
for
his
distortions
of
the
facts
whose
facts
he
asked
interviewing
the
interviewers
he
said
had
taught
him
what
a
complete
farce
history
is
these
were
all
people
that
were
in
the
room
at
the
same
time
he
marveled
and
they
couldnt
agree
on
a
thing
as
the
legions
of
teenagers
who
have
read
the
novel
on
which
the
forthcoming
film
twilight
is
based
know
the
awkward
passage
from
youth
to
maturity
isnt
the
very
worst
problem
an
adolescent
can
have
you
could
fall
helplessly
in
love
with
a
vampire
which
is
what
happens
to
the
virginal
17yearold
heroine
and
narrator
of
stephenie
meyers
book
weve
all
had
the
experience
of
being
that
age
and
feeling
that
everything
is
life
and
death
said
melissa
rosenberg
who
wrote
the
screenplay
you
know
i
have
nothing
to
wear
today
im
going
to
kill
myself
whats
so
wonderful
about
this
story
is
that
everything
actually
is
life
and
death
the
transition
from
page
to
screen
is
itself
often
a
less
than
graceful
process
and
while
its
rarely
a
matter
of
life
and
death
it
can
give
filmmakers
that
adolescent
sense
of
unease
if
this
movie
tanks
im
going
to
kill
myself
theres
no
denying
that
in
the
case
of
twilight
the
stakes
so
to
speak
are
high
the
four
novels
in
meyers
horrorromance
series
for
young
adults

twilight
was
the
first

have
sold
somewhere
near
10
million
copies
the
most
recent
breaking
dawn
racked
up
sales
of
13
million
on
its
first
day
in
bookstores
in
august
and
fans
are
on
the
rabid
side
theres
all
this
stuff
online
said
the
films
director
catherine
hardwicke
people
were
making
casting
suggestions
and
now
theyre
doing
their
own
trailers
and
posters
its
stimulating
in
a
way
a
particular
hazard
with
books
like
meyers

or
like
jk
rowlings
harry
potter
novels

is
that
younger
readers
unlike
their
more
jaded
elders
tend
to
like
their
stories
just
so
with
as
little
variation
as
possible
and
as
any
adult
who
has
ever
read
bedtime
stories
to
children
understands
when
youngsters
really
go
for
a
story
theyll
insist
on
hearing
it
again
and
again
which
is
why
movies
aimed
at
children
tweens
and
teenagers
can
have
such
a
huge
payoff
for
producers
and
distributors
two
words
repeat
business
i
didnt
want
to
be
the
screenwriter
who
disappointed
all
those
readers
rosenberg
said
nor
did
catherine
im
sure
want
to
be
the
director
who
did
so
hardwicke
said
that
when
she
was
approached
about
directing
twilight
she
was
handed
a
script
that
she
later
realized
was
very
very
different
from
the
book
soon
after
i
read
the
novel
myself
and
i
thought
lets
get
back
to
this
story
its
just
so
much
better
neither
would
admit
to
feeling
any
constraints
on
her
creativity
from
the
readers
demands
for
fidelity
to
the
novel
my
biggest
problem
was
how
to
condense
rosenberg
said
clearly
the
strategy
is
to
swear
undying
fealty
to
the
book
and
hope
the
fans
will
be
merciful
and
what
exactly
is
this
story
to
which
the
makers
of
twilight
opening
nov
21
have
plighted
their
troth
its
the
tale
of
a
bright
girl
named
bella
swan
who
moves
to
the
gloomy
town
of
forks
wash
and
on
her
first
day
at
school
meets
across
a
crowded
cafeteria
the
eyes
of
a
mysterious
classmate
named
edward
cullen
whom
she
describes
as
devastatingly
inhumanly
beautiful
edward
is
a
little
standoffish
but
bella
falls
for
him
hard
while
remaining
somewhat
puzzled
by
his
unteenageboylike
sexual
restraint
hes
determined
to
keep
a
tight
rein
on
his
impulses
which
include
in
addition
to
the
usual
ones
a
powerful
yen
to
feed
on
his
new
admirers
blood
when
she
discovers
his
secret
she
isnt
quite
sure
how
to
you
know
feel
about
this
unnerving
kink
in
his
personality
but
soon
decides
that
being
a
vampires
significant
other
is
preferable
to
depriving
herself
of
this
really
really
goodlooking
guys
company
he
remains
a
perfect
gentleman
she
a
wellbehaved
lady
and
their
fatal
attraction
stays
at
least
in
the
first
novel
unconsummated
meyer
goes
to
some
trouble
to
persuade
her
young
readers
that
there
might
actually
be
a
count
charming
out
there
for
every
shy
bella
in
the
world
the
perennially
overcast
weather
of
the
pacific
northwest
allows
edward
to
attend
school
on
most
days
despite
his
species
legendary
photosensitivity
and
he
was
raised
as
it
happens
in
a
family
of
good
vampires
who
thoughtfully
eschew
the
consumption
of
human
blood
in
favor
of
the
nourishing
though
less
tasty
vital
fluids
of
animals
theyre
kind
of
the
vampire
version
of
vegans
edwards
forbearance
however
is
sorely
tested
by
the
power
of
his
feelings
and
hardwicke
said
she
believes
that
the
everpresent
possibility
of
bellas
death
actually
enhances
the
storys
romantic
appeal
if
romeo
and
juliet
came
out
now
it
would
be
just
as
popular
she
said
look
at
titanic
a
few
years
ago
shes
on
to
something
there
the
extreme
lifeanddeathness
of
the
adolescent
notion
of
romance
but
the
vein
that
meyers
story
taps
most
obviously
is
simple
basic
fear
of
sex
bella
is
recognizably
every
teenager
who
is
terrified
of
going
all
the
way
and
edward
less
grounded
in
reality
is
a
fantasy
incarnation
of
that
scared
girls
ideal
boyfriend
infinitely

you
might
say
eternally

patient
with
her
trepidation
and
have
i
mentioned
that
hes
extremely
goodlooking
the
truth
said
the
writer
sarah
langan
whose
novel
the
missing
won
this
years
bram
stoker
award
from
the
horror
writers
association
is
that
sex
can
be
terrifying
at
that
age
even
when
youre
in
college
but
langan
who
considers
twilight
more
romance
than
horror
isnt
entirely
persuaded
by
the
fearofsex
model
here
abstinence
is
a
perfectly
valid
point
of
view
she
said

twilight
though
struck
me
as
kind
of
a
strange
wrong
version
of
what
teenagers
are
like
especially
edward
who
doesnt
even
seem
to
want
sex
all
that
much
it
made
me
long
for
judy
blume
the
truly
peculiar
thing
about
twilight
of
course
is
that
the
figure
presented
here
as
a
paragon
of
masculine
selfcontrol
is
not
in
fact
human
and
drinks
blood
over
the
years
there
have
been
a
fair
number
of
youthful
vampires
in
film
and
fiction
and
some
have
even
been
portrayed
as
objects
of
desire
the
title
character
of
george
a
romeros
martin
1977
probably
wouldnt
qualify
as
anybodys
romantic
ideal
but
the
young
lovers
in
kathryn
bigelows
superb
1987
film
near
dark
are
tragically
cute
as
are
many
of
the
teenage
bloodsuckers
in
the
lame
lost
boys
1987
a
longunawaited
sequel
to
which
was
released
last
year
there
is
a
broodingly
handsome
vampire
in
the
lurid
new
hbo
series
true
blood
too
vampirism
is
sexy
langan
said
bluntly
its
inherently
arousing
but
until
twilight
even
vampires
of
the
devastatingly
inhumanly
beautiful
variety
did
manage
between
tragic
embraces
to
be
kind
of
scary
angel
the
hunky
centuriesold
love
object
of
buffy
the
vampire
slayer
would
occasionally
get
a
wrinkly
fromhell
look
on
his
face
bare
his
fangs
and
give
vent
to
the
darker
side
of
his
nature
at
those
moments
the
viewer
would
fully
understand
why
he
was
a
candidate
for
what
buffy
and
her
gang
referred
to
as
slayage
in
twilight
slayage
isnt
a
possibility
the
only
serious
question
for
bella
and
her
breathless
readers
is
whether
shell
dare
to
do
it
with
her
badboy
lover
psychologists
call
this
approachavoidance
and
we
all
might
as
well
figure
out
a
way
to
approach
this
strange
turn
in
pop
culture
because
it
looks
as
if
theres
going
to
be
no
way
to
avoid
it
the
20
minutes
of
twilight
footage
that
the
studio
has
made
available
indicate
that
the
film
will
be
as
hardwicke
and
rosenberg
promised
exceptionally
faithful
to
its
source
material
the
leads
kristen
stewart
and
robert
pattinson
look
right

theres
a
touch
of
titanicera
leonardo
dicaprio
to
pattinson

and
the
mood
is
appropriately
ominous
describing
the
shoot
in
washington
hardwicke
said
the
weather
was
almost
too
apocalyptic
for
her
taste
there
was
hail
she
said
still
shuddering
with
disbelief
i
bought
all
this
goretex
and
nothing
worked
the
whole
thing
has
a
slightly
funky
nobigdeal
air
about
it
which
is
perhaps
the
result
of
the
movies
relatively
modest
budget
less
than
40
million
and
the
filmmakers
modest
temperaments
hardwicke
is
best
known
as
the
director
of
youthcentric
indie
films
like
thirteen
2003
and
lords
of
dogtown
2005
while
rosenbergs
background
is
mostly
in
television
as
a
writer
and
producer
of
party
of
five
and
the
oc
more
recently
she
has
worked
on
the
showtime
series
dexter
whose
characters
are
grownups
but
which
she
said
has
something
in
common
with
twilight
nonetheless
its
about
a
good
serial
killer
with
internal
demons
hes
trying
to
control
the
movie
also
appears
to
capture
the
oddly
timeless
atmosphere
of
the
book
in
which
email
notes
are
sometimes
sent
but
no
text
messages
are
no
video
games
are
played
and
no
one
seems
to
have
an
ipod
crammed
with
gangsta
rap
emo
or
heavy
metal
you
try
to
keep
current
with
teenagers
culture
and
idioms
rosenberg
said
but
in
twilight
some
of
that
feels
incongruous
one
of
the
producers
actually
said
to
me
im
uncomfortable
when
edward
uses
a
cell
phone

what
that
means
maybe
is
that
the
world
of
twilight
is
one
where
incoming
calls
from
the
real
world
can
rarely
be
heard
with
any
clarity
in
a
fantasy
universe
of
perpetual
neitherherenorthereness
sort
of
like
adolescence
itself
only
touched
up
for
maximum
devastating
inhuman
desirability
its
a
place
on
which
the
sun
never
has
to
set
where
the
bedtime
story
never
has
to
end

and
thats
what
its
fans
like
best
about
it
new
laptops
that
boot
up
in
30
seconds
too
slow
for
me
five
seconds
better
but
what
i
want
is
a
machine
thats
ready
in
about
a
second
just
like
my
smartphone
im
fully
aware
that
expressing
any
impatience
with
a
computers
boot
time
invites
derision
when
the
entire
globe
is
engulfed
in
an
economic
crisis
measuring
the
seconds
required
to
start
different
computers
may
seem
the
most
trivial
of
concerns
still
im
not
alone
unhappiness
with
boot
times
which
commonly
run
45
seconds
to
60
seconds
is
shared
by
many
computer
users
as
reflected
in
much
online
discussion
of
the
issue
ive
come
to
believe
that
the
unhappiness
does
not
illustrate
impatience
rather
it
reflects
an
important
shift
in
computing
as
we
increasingly
rely
on
our
laptops
not
as
machines
that
we
use
for
long
stretches
at
a
time
but
as
machines
for
using
the
internet
often
and
briefly
and
not
much
else
we
dont
tolerate
and
have
never
tolerated
long
wait
times
that
are
disproportionate
to
the
activity
that
follows
them
if
we
need
to
spend
only
a
few
seconds
looking
up
something
on
the
web
its
only
natural
that
we
want
the
preparatory
time
to
be
as
close
to
zero
as
possible
its
not
impatience
just
proportionality
smartphones
provide
access
to
email
and
the
web
and
now
a
fastgrowing
category
of
notebook
computers
called
netbooks
do
the
same
but
with
bigger
displays
and
keyboards
than
the
phones
netbooks
are
lightweight
and
inexpensive

around
400
for
many
models

but
to
be
truly
useful
they
need
to
be
on
and
ready
to
go
immediately
the
way
smartphones
are
we
hear
computer
manufacturers
promoting
laptops
that
can
boot
faster
than
ever
but
they
prudently
avoid
direct
comparisons
with
smartphones
the
manufacturers
have
speeded
up
boot
times
by
equipping
some
windows
machines
with
a
separate
subsystem
that
contains
its
own
central
processing
unit
if
you
choose
to
use
this
when
you
turn
on
the
machine
windows
is
bypassed
and
a
minioperating
system
is
loaded
instead
along
with
a
limited
set
of
applications
that
include
a
web
browser
and
a
few
other
software
odds
and
ends
limited
functionality
doesnt
bother
me
a
browser
and
email
will
keep
me
happy
but
these
machines
take
too
long
to
reach
a
state
of
usefulness
at
present
the
only
way
to
bring
a
laptop
to
life
quickly
is
to
summon
it
not
from
a
cold
state
nor
from
deep
hibernation
suspendtodisk
but
from
standby
mode
suspendtoram
in
which
the
last
session
is
stored
in
memory
network
connections
are
lost
however
and
holding
the
data
in
memory
drains
the
battery
one
manufacturer
whose
ultralightweight
netbooks
have
helped
to
create
the
category
is
asus
based
in
taiwan
to
achieve
faster
boot
times
asus
equips
its
windows
machines
with
express
gate
a
subsystem
that
it
says
can
boot
up
in
as
few
as
eight
seconds
depending
on
the
speed
of
the
processor
and
hard
drive
the
company
sent
me
a
62pound
g50v
gaming
machine
for
a
test
drive
i
found
that
in
express
gate
mode
it
took
only
eight
seconds
to
boot
up
as
promised
but
this
was
only
a
preparatory
step
in
checking
my
email
43
seconds
elapsed
before
the
browser
loaded
my
wifi
connection
was
established
and
gmail
opened
a
wholly
different
approach
is
taken
by
arjan
van
de
ven
and
auke
kok
engineers
at
the
intel
open
source
technology
center
who
set
out
to
create
versions
of
linux
that
boot
up
in
only
five
seconds
instead
of
the
45
normally
required
they
were
also
determined
to
boot
up
with
the
main
system
without
relying
on
a
special
subsystem
like
express
gate
they
succeeded
demonstrating
their
feat
at
the
linux
plumbers
conference
in
september
with
an
asus
eee
pc
901
equipped
with
a
solidstate
drive
which
helps
but
a
slow
atom
cpu
which
does
not
van
de
ven
has
since
used
the
same
techniques
to
reduce
the
boot
time
to
only
three
seconds
on
laptops
with
the
much
faster
core
2
duo
cpus
the
time
needed
to
connect
to
the
network
and
load
a
browser
however
was
not
included
still
another
approach
and
to
me
the
most
intriguing
is
being
readied
by
dell
for
release
by
yearend
its
latitude
on
feature
will
not
try
to
claim
the
fastest
boot
time
on
the
block
it
will
still
take
40
seconds
to
45
seconds
to
get
its
special
nonwindows
subsystem
up
and
running
but
once
it
is
on
it
can
stay
on
indefinitely
because
its
engineered
with
a
lowvoltage
processor
to
conserve
battery
power
between
charges
a
dell
spokesman
said
the
laptops
in
the
laboratory
were
getting
almost
four
days
of
use
on
a
single
charge
heres
what
catches
my
interest
when
youre
not
using
a
latitude
on
laptop
its
screen
will
go
dark
but
its
not
in
standby
mode

its
in
a
lowpower
state
as
dell
terms
it
this
permits
it
to
keep
network
connections
alive
including
wifi
and
3g
mobile
broadband
and
even
virtual
private
networks
while
it
continuously
loads
email
in
the
background
with
a
touch
the
screen
lights
up
in
1
to
2
seconds
dell
says
just
as
a
smartphone
does
thats
exactly
what
id
like
to
have
in
fact
thats
all
i
want
i
dont
want
to
lug
around
the
main
system
i
want
just
the
subsystem
thats
engineered
for
unbroken
internet
connections
and
frequent
brief
looks
dell
however
is
not
offering
this
as
an
inexpensive
netbook
latitude
on
will
be
packaged
as
one
feature
on
a
fully
loaded
notebook
marketed
to
corporate
executives
dell
has
not
announced
pricing
but
currently
those
models
begin
at
1999
more
bad
news
its
intended
customers
corporate
it
departments
have
directed
dell
to
require
a
password
from
a
user
every
time
the
machine
returns
to
full
power
no
thanks
i
will
wait
then
for
the
next
generation
of
instanton
machines
maintaining
internet
connections
even
when
the
screen
is
darkened
serving
uncomplainingly
for
days
on
a
single
charge
and
priced
inexpensively

and
with
passwords
made
optional
if
that
takes
a
while

my
twin

eli
is
jealous
of
sea
horses
they
are
the
only
animal
species
in
which
the

gives
birth
to
the

male
sea
horses

the

eli
is
a
transgender
man
and
lived
the
first
20
years
of
our
lives
as
my
fraternal
twin
sister
i
have
plenty
of
memories
of
my
twin
as
a
little
girl
as
emma
not
eli
more
often
though
my
memories
adjust
to
represent
eli
as
i
know
him
now
as
my
brother
when
we
were
5
living
in
a
small
apartment
in
portland
ore
my
mother
made
our
favorite
breakfast
of
buckwheat
pancakes
on
weekends
shaping
the
batter
into
ks
and
es
for
kate
and
emma
one
morning
as
my
mother
assembled
the
ingredients
emma
pretending
she
was
a
chicken
took
two
eggs
from
the
counter
and
placed
them
next
to
each
other
on
the
carpet
i
remember
it
was
a
pair
of
eggs
because
even
at
our
young
age
we
knew
what
it
meant
to
be
twins
and
whenever
we
played
house
babies
came
in
twos
emma
jammed
her
thumbs
under
her
armpits
and
pumped
her
arms
in
excited
flutters
before
crouching
gently
above
the
eggs
as
if
to
incubate
them
then
it
was
over
the
mother
hen
accidentally
sat
on
her
eggs
emma
stood
up
crying
as
egg
whites
ran
down
the
backs
of
her
legs
as
a
5yearold
girl
she
couldnt
have
known
how
her
relationship
with
eggs
would
again
be
tinged
with
tragedy
when
she
was
an
adult
a
few
years
later
we
were
living
in
an
apartment
complex
with
a
swimming
pool
and
that
summer
we
lived
in
our
swimsuits
which
were
practically
worn
translucent
by
september
each
evening
we
would
compare
our
tan
lines
and
soothe
our
windchapped
cheeks
sometimes
we
had
the
pool
to
ourselves
other
times
visiting
grandchildren
or
older
boys
from
another
building
would
show
up
towels
in
hand
interrupting
our
games
with
their
unpredictable
and
explosive
splashing

usually
patient

of

glanced
at
the
boys
then
back
at
her
laughing
and
feeling
the
solidarity
of
sisters
which
looking
back
strikes
me
as
delightfully
ironic
did
an
envy
of
boys
already
lurk
in
emmas
subconscious
was
her
mind
already
puzzling
over
bodies
and
skin
heart
and
soul
how
it
all
fits
together
and
what
happens
when
it
doesnt
emma
and
i
started
menstruating
three
days
apart
she
bled
first
which
made
her
seem
old
and
wise
when
i
followed
close
on
her
heels
both
of
us
fumbling
with
pads
and
aspirin
and
new
knowledge
growing
up
a
twin
i
thought
everything
that
happened
to
my
counterpart
would
happen
to
me
but
our
shared
experience
diverged
at
age
20
when
emma
realized
after
several
years
of
grappling
with
gender
that
she
wasnt
meant
to
be
female
he
was
male
and
he
chose
eli
as
his
new
name
soon
hormone
replacement
therapy
would
begin
to
change
elis
female
body
to
match
his
male
sense
of
self
even
as
this
process
raised
new
questions
for
our
family
the
more
clearly
eli
articulated
his
identity
the
closer
i
felt
to
him
our
mothers
support
was
more
tempered
by
concern
about
the
inevitable
struggles
to
come
how
would
eli
be
viewed
in
society
how
would
he
raise
a
family
elis
gender
transition
has
occurred
in
many
stages
and
while
some
aspects
of
his
metamorphosis
the
deepening
voice
the
chest
surgery
are
permanent
other
changes
like
elis
new
musculature
and
the
redistribution
of
body
fat
away
from
his
hips
would
reverse
if
he
were
to
stop
hormone
therapy
but
when
it
comes
to
the
effects
of
testosterone
on
the
female
reproductive
system
the
impact
is
profound
and
while
the
permanence
of
the
damage
is
not
entirely
known
reproductive
options
for
transgender
men
become
more
limited
the
longer
they
take
testosterone
some
transgender
men
have
hysterectomies
early
in
their
transitions
eliminating
all
reminders
of
their
female
reproductive
capacity
others
either
dont
think
such
surgery
is
necessary
or
defer
in
the
hope
that
they
might
someday
be
able
to
bear
children
themselves
eli
has
confided
in
me
his
reservations
about
sacrificing
this
element
of
female
experience
he
now
faces
tough
choices
about
how
to
reconcile
the
reality
of
his
physical
transition
with
his
desire
to
have
biological
children
researchers
continue
to
explore
reproductive
technologies
yet
even
with
possible
breakthroughs
on
the
horizon
my
brothers
chance
of
successfully
bearing
his
own
child
depends
on
societys
willingness
to
embrace
a
new
understanding
of
pregnancy
as
an
experience
no
longer
reserved
only
for
women

an
understanding
in
fact
that
not
all
people
with
a
uterus
are
women
sometimes
the
realization
that
eli
might
not
be
able
to
bear
children
of
his
own
suffocates
me
and
i
ache
for
simplicity
and
answers
we
talk
often
about
his
worries
and
they
have
become
my
own
as
with
everything
we
share
should
he
stop
taking
the
testosterone
now
so
that
maybe
in
five
years
he
can
try
to
become
pregnant
should
he
suspend
the
hormone
therapy
and
try
to
use
his
eggs
to
freeze
embryos
for
later
or
keep
taking
the
hormones
and
have
a
hysterectomy
to
eliminate
any
chance
that
he
might
get
ovarian
cancer
should
he
pursue
other
avenues
of
parenthood
like
adoption
what
23yearold
should
have
to
face
such
choices
eli
is
full
of
life
yet
soon
to
be
rendered
infertile
by
the
very
treatment
that
has
made
possible
his
visions
of
himself
as
father
and
so
we
wait
for
the
day
when
science
might
make
a
sea
horse
of
him
a
year
into
elis
transition
roughly
two
and
a
half
years
ago
i
sat
in
my
colleges
health
services
complex
awaiting
results
of
my
own
pregnancy
test
my
very
regular
cycle
was
late
and
i
berated
myself
for
the
false
sense
of
security
that
three
years
on
the
pill
had
given
me
ten
minutes
later
when
the
result
was
negative
and
the
nurse
told
me
to
check
back
in
a
week
if
my
period
didnt
come
i
still
couldnt
let
out
my
breath
i
sat
there
cursing
my
fertility
its
inconveniences
and
threats
at
the
same
time
my
twin
sat
in
the
waiting
room
of
the
callenlorde
community
health
center
in
manhattan
facing
the
decision
of
whether
to
ask
for
his
weekly
hormone
shot
in
the
thigh
or
the
backside
depending
on
where
he
thought
the
concentrated
testosterone
would
cause
the
least
muscle
cramping
the
next
day
it
would
be
another
year
of
such
appointments
before
he
would
be
approved
to
inject
himself
eli
told
me
he
enjoyed
watching
the
oily
liquid
be
drawn
up
into
the
syringe
and
then
deposited
into
his
muscle
in
the
months
to
come
he
would
continue
to
worry
about
his
fertility
mourn
its
fleeting
existence
wish
he
did
not
have
to
give
it
up
we
were
both
in
awe
of
the
power
of
hormone
therapy
to
vanquish
his
menstrual
cycle
but
we
were
learning
a
lesson
in
sacrifice
a
year
after
my
pregnancy
scare
i
found
myself
staring
at
an
advertisement
in
a
public
bathroom
for
a
local
fertility
clinic
appealing
for
exceptional
egg
donors
i
tensed
with
the
recognition
of
a
truth
i
had
known
if
never
spoken
since
the
day
eli
called
to
announce
his
transition
if
he
ever
needs
eggs
that
have
a
genetic
link
to
his
own
i
will
give
him
mine
they
could
be
implanted
in
a
female
partner
or
surrogate
or
in
the
event
we
do
one
day
become
like
sea
horses
in
him
theres
something
reassuring
in
the
possibility
however
remote
in
our
attempts
to
understand
disruptions
of
self
and
relationships
we
often
look
to
the
natural
world
to
tell
us
stories
of
ourselves
we
hope
the
animal
kingdom
will
naturalize
behavior
that
falls
outside
of
the
human
binary
we
exclaim
over
gay
penguins
in
the
central
park
zoo
we
note
patterns
of
grieving
in
animals
from
geese
to
elephants
to
help
locate
our
own
mourning
in
a
larger
continuum
of
emotional
response
we
point
to
promiscuous
chimpanzees
monogamous
swans
and
polygamous
walruses
to
illuminate
the
dueling
joys
and
heartbreaks
of
human
mating
behavior
as
the
complexities
of
my
brothers
transition
threaten
his
newfound
tranquillity
my
whole
family
has
turned
to
the
sea
horse
to
give
us
perspective
its
easier
for
me
to
think
about
the
unimaginably
tough
choices
my
brother
has
had
to
make
if
i
can
crack
jokes
with
him
about
pregnant
sea
horse
fathers
bucking
the
gender
binary
from
the
depths
of
the
ocean
my
mother
she
has
started
compulsively
bidding
on
sea
horse
paraphernalia
on
ebay
with
a
potential
grandmothers
curiosity
she
daydreams
about
elis
children
perhaps
he
could
have
twins
and
surely
they
would
be
voracious
readers
too
but
approaches
the
situation
with
a
mothers
patience
last
christmas
she
bought
eli
a
glass
bowl
with
delicately
etched
sea
horses
around
its
rim
the
bowl
now
sits
on
a
table
in
elis
room
holding
his
syringes
and
bottle
of
testosterone
inspired
eli
and
i
went
a
step
further
on
our
birthday
by
getting
matching
shoulder
tattoos
of
two
entwined
sea
horses
for
just
over
two
years
elis
body
has
carried
the
testosterone
that
is
responsible
for
the
biggest

he
sometimes
says
only

sacrifice
of
his
transition
the
loss
of
his
fertility
while
we
no
longer
call
ourselves
sisters
our
identity
as
twins
is
unchanged
and
we
remain
deeply
connected
by
friendship
by
ink
and
by
our
shared
conviction
that
like
the
male
sea
horse
eli
will
be
an
excellent
father
after
president
mccain
or
president
obama
takes
the
oath
of
office
in
january
he
may
have
a
shiny
new
black
limousine
to
go
along
with
his
notsonew
white
house
general
motors
is
believed
to
be
putting
the
final
touches
on
a
new
first
car
an
analysis
of
unauthorized
photographs
taken
while
the
car
was
being
tested
last
summer
on
public
roads
suggests
that
the
presidential
ride
will
be
a
truckbased
cadillac
it
will
presumably
replace
the
cadillac
that
president
bush
has
used
since
2005
this
new
car
will
be
a
caddy
like
no
other
the
photos
by
chris
doane
a
spy
photographer
who
hunts
big
automotive
game

future
models
that
havent
been
publicly
revealed

for
magazines
and
web
sites
provide
clues
about
how
specialized
presidential
transportation
has
become
since
the
first
white
house
fleet
was
ordered
for
william
howard
taft
in
1909
president
taft
rode
in
a
stock
white
steam
car
or
a
conventional
piercearrow
but
the
next
president
will
travel
in
a
fortresslike
vehicle
that
was
mostly
built
from
scratch
the
photographer
noted
that
the
limousine
was
being
tested
possibly
for
comparison
purposes
with
a
pair
of
gmc
topkick
mediumduty
trucks
the
limousine
seemed
to
be
riding
on
the
same
195inch
goodyear
regional
rhs
tires
as
the
trucks
indicating
that
it
is
far
heavier
than
a
civilian
cadillac

even
the
longest
stretch
limousines
built
with
the
gm
divisions
heavyduty
coachbuilder
package
indeed
it
is
believed
that
the
limo
is
based
on
gms
2500
line
of
trucks
which
includes
an
extraheavyduty
version
of
the
suburban
although
the
raised
roof
and
wide
windshield
pillars
are
inherited
from
the
ultraarmored
limousines
that
entered
presidential
service
in
2001
only
educated
guesses
can
be
made
about
the
technical
details
because
neither
the
secret
service
nor
general
motors
will
discuss
the
car
or
even
confirm
that
a
new
one
has
been
under
development
it
is
impossible
to
provide
basic
specifications
or
dimensions
calls
to
cadillacs
media
relations
department
were
not
returned
and
the
secret
service
declined
to
comment
so
people
who
are
curious
about
such
things
look
for
clues
and
make
deductions
i
have
spent
almost
30
years
paying
close
attention
to
presidential
vehicles
as
part
of
my
interest
in
what
are
called
professional
cars
which
also
include
hearses
and
ambulances
i
am
the
author
of
professional
cars
ambulances
hearses
and
flower
cars
krause
publications
2004
other
sources
i
have
consulted
on
cars
used
by
past
presidents
include
presidential
cars
and
transportation
by
william
d
siuru
jr
and
andrea
stewart
krause
publications
1995
and
presidents
on
wheels
by
herbert
ridgeway
collins
bonanza
books
1971
but
my
interest
has
me
looking
for
clues
wherever
i
can
find
them
for
example
television
clips
showing
george
w
bush
entering
and
exiting
the
rear
doors
of
his
limos
indicate
that
the
windows
are
at
least
5
inches
thick
nearly
twice
the
depth
of
what
was
used
on
presidential
limousines
in
the
1980s
and
90s
while
i
do
not
know
what
type
of
weapons
such
thick
windows
are
designed
to
guard
against
a
halfinch
of
transparent
armor
is
enough
to
stop
a
44
magnum
round
at
pointblank
range
at
a
thickness
of
125
inches
to
15
inches
the
same
material
can
withstand
highervelocity
bullets
fired
from
military
assault
rifles
were
an
attack
to
occur
the
ballistic
forces
of
bullets
fired
into
the
windows
would
be
absorbed
within
a
succession
of
glass
and
plastic
layers
after
which
a
flexible
inner
coating
known
as
an
antispall
shield
would
keep
glass
from
entering
the
passenger
compartment
though
the
materials
protecting
the
cars
body
are
also
classified
they
are
probably
intended
to
break
up
incoming
projectiles
with
a
hard
substance
before
their
energy
is
dissipated
by
a
soft
substance
material
traditionally
used
for
this
purpose
includes
dualhardness
steel
aluminum
titanium
and
ceramics
large
steel
overlaps
are
also
typically
added
to
the
body
openings
of
armored
autos
to
deter
attackers
who
might
try
shooting
through
the
door
gaps
denied
the
convertible
tops
and
sunroofs
that
were
once
found
on
presidents
cars
and
seated
behind
glass
that
is
half
as
transparent
and
several
times
as
soundabsorbent
as
that
of
a
standard
car
the
president
has
limited
interaction
with
the
public
while
inside
his
limo
but
he
can
make
his
presence
known
by
turning
on
fluorescent
interior
lighting
that
makes
him
visible
to
bystanders
or
by
using
the
builtin
public
address
system
aircraft
tiedowns
welded
to
the
chassis
allow
the
limousine
to
be
transported
aboard
a
military
cargo
jet
which
also
often
carries
the
secret
services
suburban
escort
vehicles
and
at
least
one
limo
used
as
a
backup
or
decoy
on
television
footage
of
a
trip
to
pakistan
in
march
2000
it
appeared
as
though
president
bill
clintons
motorcade
used
five
decoy
cars
thus
it
is
likely
that
gm
is
building
not
just
one
new
presidential
limousine
but
perhaps
two
or
three
that
can
be
used
as
backups
or
decoys
there
will
be
no
way
of
knowing
until
the
cars
are
seen
together
presidential
limos
would
have
great
appeal
to
collectors
but
the
secret
service
has
shown
no
enthusiasm
for
letting
recent
white
house
cars
fall
into
private
hands
when
the
cars
are
retired
they
often
disappear
to
be
destroyed
or
used
in
secret
service
training
the
department
of
state
also
uses
specialized
vehicles
and
the
agencys
disposal
methods
have
been
detailed
in
a

forty
years
ago
a
panel
of
auto
journalists
picked
the
nsu
ro80
as
european
car
of
the
year
now
mostly
forgotten
the
ro80
was
a
german
sedan
with
an
aerodynamic
shape
that
presaged
the
audi
5000
and
ford
taurus
of
the
1980s
as
important
as
its
trendsetting
styling
though
the
ro80
featured
the
first
wankel
engine
in
a
massproduced
car
potential
gamechangers
in
the
auto
industry
have
often
ended
up
as
blind
alleys
dinosaurs
at

have
birds
as
their
living
legacy
but
innovative
cars
like
the
tucker
corvair
and
citroen

can
be
found
only
in
the
automotive
fossil
record
carmakers
have
learned
that
it
doesnt
always
pay
to
innovate
but
for
a
brief
time
in
the
late
1960s
and
early
1970s
it
looked
as
if
real
innovation
was
taking
hold
in
the
form
of
a
new
powerplant
that
was
lighter
smoother
simpler
than
a
reciprocating
piston
engine
and
also
capable
of
producing
more
power
for
its

technology
felix
wankel
an
engineer
at
nsu
had
been
experimenting
since
1954
with
a
simpler
internalcombustion
engine
his
elegant
design
consisted
of
a
rounded
triangular
rotor
that
spun
in
an
oval
combustion
chamber
as
the
rotor
moved
in
its
eccentric
orbit
around
a
central
shaft
the
area
of
the
three
combustion
chambers
one
for
each
side
of
the
triangle
contracted
creating
compression
and
thus
power
but
an
obstacle
to
engine
longevity
emerged
it
was
hard
to
get
a
good
seal
on
the
combustion
chambers
where
the
rotor
tips
or
apexes
met
the
inside
of
the
chamber
before
the
ro80
there
had
been
attempts
at
wankelpowered
cars

nsus
own
wankel
spider
and
the
mazda
cosmo
sports
cars

but
the
ro80
was
the
revolutionary
engines
first
shot

the
big
time
if
things
had
gone
as
planned
bmw
wouldnt
be
the
only
prestigious
threeletter
brand
of

today
initial
orders
for
the
1968
nsu
ro80
were
brisk
soon
however
nsu
was
dealing
in
damage
control
in
late
1968
the
german
magazine
auto
motor
und
sport
reported
that
half
of
the
191
ro80
owners
it
had
surveyed
said
that
engines
had
been
replaced
under
warranty
in
neglecting
to
test
the

nsu
snatched
defeat
from
the
jaws
of

the
culprit
turned
out

of

was
one
of
about
18

wankel
licensees
in
the

mazda
decided
that
its
future
lay
in
differentiating
itself
from
toyota
and
nissan
it
cast
its
lot
with
the
wankel
which
the
company
called
the
rotary
engine
the
first
rotarypowered
mazda
to
make
an
impact
in
the
united
states
was
the
rx2
introduced
in
1970
the
rx2
was
a
small
coupe
roughly
the
size
of
a
toyota
corolla

with

of

gushed
over

cj
batten
was
the
first
design
engineer
that
ford
hired
for
its
wankel
development
program
in
1971
in
a
recent
interview
batten
said
that
ford
began
looking
at
the
wankel
because
its
archrival
general
motors
had
one
that
was
nearly
productionready
for
its
chevrolet
monza
coupe
in
an
interview
batten
recalled
evaluating
a
mazda
and
being
impressed
the
rx2
with
a
little
over
100
horsepower
would
run
like
a
200horsepower
mustang
he
said
batten
reckons
that
the
advantages
in
packaging
and
smoothness
werent
enough
to
overcome
the
reciprocating
engines
advantage
of
incumbency
gms
president
ed
cole
was
a
proponent
of
the
wankel
in
the
early
1970s
gm
showed
several
wankelpowered
midengine
corvette
design
studies
that
would
have
been
worldclass
sports
cars
car
magazines
said
the
sleek
midengine
vette
was
a
sure
bet
for
production
cole
also
planned
to
use
the
wankel
in
mainstream
cars
batten
recalls
that
as
wishful
thinking
he
said
the
accountants
who
held
the
purse
strings
pointed
out
that
chevrolet
could
already
sell
every
corvette
it
could
build
why
was
a
more
advanced
more
expensive
car
needed
the
logic
was
hard
to
dispute
and
the
corvette
would
soldier
on
until
1984
with
its
1963vintage
platform
not
much
later
cole
retired
and
the
arab
oil
embargo
underscored
how
thirsty
the
early
wankels
were
gms
wankel
program
came
to
a
sudden
halt
ford
ended
its
development
program
the
cancellation
of
gms
wankel
even
had
a
ripple
affect
on
american
motors
which
had
engineered
its
futuristic
glassy
pacer
to
take
a
gmbuilt

instead
amc

that

the
1974
arab

embargo
hit
mazda
hard
its
small
rx2
could
barely
manage
15
miles
a
gallon
about
half
as
much
as
the
comparably
sized
corolla
the
rx3
a
larger
successor
added
a
wagon
body
style
but
that
car
was
bigger
and
heavier
and
had
even
worse
mileage
mazdas
piled
up
at
dealers
and
at
the
ports
so
the
company
hedged
its
bets
with
pistonengine
cars
while
it
improved
the
rotarys
cleanliness
and
efficiency
in
1978
it
introduced
the
car
that
made
the
best
use
to
date
of
the
rotarys
distinctive
qualities
the
1979
rx7
was
a
milestone
at
a
time
when
sports
cars
were
growing
flabby
the
rx7
was
light
nimble
and
basic
with
an
engine
so
revhappy
that
a
buzzer
had
to
be
installed
to
let
the
driver
know
when
the
engine
speed
had
reached
the
danger
zone
mazdas
new
strategy
was
to
reserve
the
rotary
for
its
specialty
cars
while
using
piston
engines
in
the
rest
of
its
line
mazdas
rotary
design
reached
its
pinnacle
with
the
renesis
engine
introduced
in
the
2003
rx8
the
most
powerful
efficient
and
cleanest
naturally
aspirated
wankel
yet
and
because
it
is
also
wellsuited

have

alan
greenspan
the
former
federal
reserve
chairman
acknowledged
in
a
congressional
hearing
last
month
that
he
had
made
an
error
in
assuming
that
the
markets
would
properly
regulate
themselves
and
added
that
he
had
no
idea
a
financial
disaster
was
in
the
making
whats
more
he
said
the
feds
own
computer
models
and
economic
experts
simply
did
not
forecast
the
current
financial
crisis
greenspans
comments
may
have
left
the
impression
that
no
one
in
the
world
could
have
predicted
the
crisis
yet
it
is
clear
that
well
before
home
prices
started
falling
in
2006
lots
of
people
were
worried
about
the
housing
boom
and
its
potential
for
creating
economic
disaster
its
just
that
the
fed
did
not
take
them
very
seriously
for
example
i
clearly
remember
a
taxi
driver
in
miami
explaining
to
me
years
ago
that
the
housing
bubble
there
was
getting
crazy
with
all
the
construction
under
way
which
he
pointed
out
as
we
drove
along
he
said
that
there
would
surely
be
a
glut
in
the
market
and
eventually
a
disaster
but
why
werent
the
experts
at
the
fed
saying
such
things
and
why
didnt
a
consensus
of
economists
at
universities
and
other
institutions
warn
that
a
crisis
was
on
the
way
the
field
of
social
psychology
provides
a
possible
answer
in
his
classic
1972
book
groupthink
irving
l
janis
the
yale
psychologist
explained
how
panels
of
experts
could
make
colossal
mistakes
people
on
these
panels
he
said
are
forever
worrying
about
their
personal
relevance
and
effectiveness
and
feel
that
if
they
deviate
too
far
from
the
consensus
they
will
not
be
given
a
serious
role
they
selfcensor
personal
doubts
about
the
emerging
group
consensus
if
they
cannot
express
these
doubts
in
a
formal
way
that
conforms
with
apparent
assumptions
held
by
the
group
members
of
the
fed
staff
were
issuing
some
warnings
but
greenspan
was
right
the
warnings
were
not
predictions
they
tended
to
be
technical
in
nature
did
not
offer
a
scenario
of
crashing
home
prices
and
economic
confidence
and
tended
to
come
late
in
the
housing
boom
a
search
of
the
federal
reserve
boards
working
paper
series
reveals
a
few
papers
that
touch
on
the
bubble
for
example
a
2004
paper
by
joshua
gallin
a
fed
economist
concluded
indeed
one
might
be
tempted
to
cite
the
currently
low
level
of
the
rentprice
ratio
as
a
sign
that
we
are
in
a
houseprice
bubble
but
the
paper
did
not
endorse
this
view
saying
that
several
important
caveats
argue
against
such
a
strong
conclusion
and
in
favor
of
further
research
one
of
greenspans
fellow
board
members
edward
m
gramlich
urgently
warned
about
the
inadequate
regulation
of
subprime
mortgages
but
judging
at
least
from
his
2007
book
subprime
mortgages
he
did
not
warn
about
a
housing
bubble
let
alone
that
its
bursting
would
have
any
systemic
consequences
from
my
own
experience
on
expert
panels
i
know
firsthand
the
pressures
that
people

might
i
say
mavericks

may
feel
when
questioning
the
group
consensus
i
was
connected
with
the
federal
reserve
system
as
a
member
the
economic
advisory
panel
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
new
york
from
1990
until
2004
when
the
new
york
banks
new
president
timothy
f
geithner
arrived
that
panel
advises
the
president
of
the
new
york
bank
who
in
turn
is
vice
chairman
of
the
federal
open
market
committee
which
sets
interest
rates
in
my
position
on
the
panel
i
felt
the
need
to
use
restraint
while
i
warned
about
the
bubbles
i
believed
were
developing
in
the
stock
and
housing
markets
i
did
so
very
gently
and
felt
vulnerable
expressing
such
quirky
views
deviating
too
far
from
consensus
leaves
one
feeling
potentially
ostracized
from
the
group
with
the
risk
that
one
may
be
terminated
reading
some
of
geithners
speeches
from
around
that
time
shows
that
he
was
concerned
about
systemic
risks
but
concluded
that
the
financial
system
was
getting
stronger
and
more
resilient
he
was
worried
about
the
unsustainability
of
a
low
savings
rate
government
deficit
and
current
account
deficit
none
of
which
caused
our
current
crisis
in
2005
in
the
second
edition
of
my
book
irrational
exuberance
i
stated
clearly
that
a
catastrophic
collapse
of
the
housing
and
stock
markets
could
be
on
its
way
i
wrote
that
significant
further
rises
in
these
markets
could
lead
eventually
to
even
more
significant
declines
and
that
this
might
result
in
a
substantial
increase
in
the
rate
of
personal
bankruptcies
which
could
lead
to
a
secondary
string
of
bankruptcies
of
financial
institutions
as
well
and
said
that
this
could
result
in
another
possibly
worldwide
recession
i
distinctly
remember
that
while
writing
this
i
feared
criticism
for
gratuitous
alarmism
and
indeed
such
criticism
came
i
gave
talks
in
2005
at
both
the
office
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
at
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corp
in
which
i
argued
that
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
dangerous
housing
bubble
i
urged
these
mortgage
regulators
to
impose
suitability
requirements
on
mortgage
lenders
to
assure
that
the
loans
were
appropriate
for
the
people
taking
them
the
reaction
to
this
suggestion
was
roughly
this
yes
some
staff
members
had
expressed
such
concerns
and
yes
officials
knew
about
the
possibility
that
there
was
a
bubble
but
they
werent
taking
any
of
us
seriously
i
based
my
predictions
largely
on
the
recently
developed
field
of
behavioral
economics
which
posits
that
psychology
matters
for
economic
events
behavioral
economists
are
still
regarded
as
a
fringe
group
by
many
mainstream
economists
support
from
fellow
behavioral
economists
was
important
in
my
daring
to
talk
about
speculative
bubbles
speculative
bubbles
are
caused
by
contagious
excitement
about
investment
prospects
i
find
that
in
casual
conversation
many
of
my
mainstream
economist
friends
tell
me
that
they
are
aware
of
such
excitement
too
but
very
few
will
talk
about
it
professionally
why
do
professional
economists
always
seem
to
find
that
concerns
with
bubbles
are
overblown
or
unsubstantiated
i
have
wondered
about
this
for
years
and
still
do
not
quite
have
an
answer
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
the
tool
kit
given
to
economists
as
opposed
to
psychologists
and
perhaps
even
with
the
selfselection
of
those
attracted
to
the
technical
mathematical
field
of
economics
economists
arent
generally
trained
in
psychology
and
so
want
to
divert
the
subject
of
discussion
to
things
they
understand
well
they
pride
themselves
on
being
rational
the
notion
that
people
are
making
huge
errors
in
judgment
is
not
appealing
in
addition
it
seems
that
concerns
about
professional
stature
may
blind
us
to
the
possibility
that
we
are
witnessing
a
market
bubble
we
all
want
to
associate
ourselves
with
dignified
people
and
dignified
ideas
speculative
bubbles
and
those
who
study
them
have
been
deemed
undignified
in
short
janis
insights
seem
right
on
the
mark
people
compete
for
stature
and
the
ideas
often
just
tag
along
presidential
campaigns
are
no
different
candidates
cannot
try
interesting
and
controversial
new
ideas
during
a
campaign
whose
main
purpose
is
to
establish
that
the
candidate
has
the
stature
to
be
president
unless
greenspan
was
exceptionally
insightful
about
social
psychology
he
may
not
have
perceived
that
experts
around
him
could
have
been
subject
to
the
same
traps
those
who
are
hoping
to
earn
extra
money
for
the
holidays
this
year
may
find
the
seasonal
market
anything
but
generous
as
jobs
are
likely
to
be
scarce
and
competition
intense
because
consumers
are
weighed
down
with
economic
worries
retailers
face
incredible
challenges
heading
into
the
fourth
quarter
rosalind
wells
chief
economist
for
the
national
retail
federation
said
in
a
statement
last
month
to
meet
those
challenges
they
may
have
to
trim
both
inventory
levels
and
labor
costs

and
recent
surveys
about
seasonal
hiring
bear
this
out
jonas
prising
president
of
the
north
american
division
of
the
staffing
firm
manpower
said
the
companys
quarterly
employment
outlook
survey
showed
the
hiring
market
for
the
wholesaleretail
sector
to
be
the
weakest
in
17
years
at
a
time
when
retailers
should
be
gearing
up
for
the
holiday
season
many
are
taking
a
waitandsee
approach
there
is
a
lot
of
talent
out
there
looking
for
work
so
the
actual
decision
for
businesses
to
ramp
up
a
work
force
can
be
made
later
in
the
season
he
said
even
in
dining
hotels
and
call
centers
they
can
wait
a
little
later
few
companies
will
acknowledge
publicly
that
they
are
scaling
back
holiday
hiring
because
it
implies
slowing
sales
said
shawn
boyer
chief
executive
of
snagajobcom
a
job
board
for
hourly
positions
but
according
to
surveys
done
by
the
company
managers
in
general
are
planning
to
hire
fewer
workers
this
year
he
said
part
of
the
reason
is
that
existing
staff
members
are
agreeing
to
take
on
additional
hours
more
people
are
interested
in
doing
overtime
this
year
so
businesses
are
waiting
later
in
the
season
to
hire
boyer
said
for
some
businesses
the
credit
crisis
has
compounded
the
problem
of
declining
consumer
spending
because
credit
lines
they
often
use
to
stock
stores
and
finance
seasonal
hiring
are
not
available
even
businesses
holding
their
own
during
this
downturn
are
being
cautious
john
thrailkill
vice
president
of
stores
at
the
container
store
said
locations
in
manhattan
white
plains
ny
and
paramus
nj
were
hiring
roughly
the
same
number
of
workers
as
last
year
partly
because
people
who
live
in
smaller
spaces
need
more
storage
capacity
but
stores
in
other
parts
of
the
country
with
slower
sales
are
likely
to
cut
back
their
hiring
he
said
scheduling
has
become
more
important
now
too
he
said
we
are
really
digging
into
every
hour
at
every
store
to
make
sure
that
if
we
only
need
12
people
on
the
floor
during
a
particular
hour
we
dont
have

this

from

as

im
going

ive
tried

snagajob
i
go
out
every

and
put
in
applications
although
tam
expected
a
competitive
landscape
for
fulltime

he
was
surprised
at
the
number
of
applicants
for
holiday
jobs
a
year
ago
i
wouldnt
have
thought
i
would
have
trouble
getting
one
of
those
positions
he
said
but
now
i
will
take
whatever
comes
along
i
have
no
choice
retailers
often
hire
from
the
same
pool
of
workers
they
used
in
previous
holiday
seasons
but
new
job
seekers
can
increase
their
chances
by
highlighting
on
their
applications
any
special
skills
they
have

speaking
more
than
one

for

or

applicants
may
also
need
to
be
more
flexible
about
scheduling
than
they
were
in
previous
years
you
need
to
have
a

who
works
with

on

selection
you
dont
want
to
go
in
with
a
really
complex
schedule
because
a
hiring
manager
doesnt
have
the
time
to
deal
with
that

to
spread
their

by
applying

in
a

of

like
low

hotels

and

its
a

game
boyer
said
its
not
all
doom

gloom
either
discount
retailers
like

are
likely
to
be

said
people
who
normally

are
going

at

this

she
said
another
bright
spot
is
online

this

it
is

to

said
this
is
one
sector
in

that
should
be
looking
for
more

that

will
be

this

the

about

conway
said
i
get
the
sense
our

are
going

raise
the

they

she
said
because
they
are
relying
heavily
on

to
be
a
successful
channel
for
them
quite
frankly
she
added
were
nervous
we
wont
have

this
tuesday
night
as

will
you

i
can
take
my

off
the
serious

ive
been
saving
it
for

night
by
contrast
the
ebullience
of
organizers
of
tuesday
nights
events
in
wasilla
and
washington
seemed
unassailable
perhaps
that
was
because
they
will
be
celebrating
themselves
as
much
as
their
candidates
in
wasilla
mccain
and
the
republican
party
seem
like
afterthoughts
wafting
after
what
is
essentially
a
lovefest
for

if

their

trumping

mark

a

of
marketwatch
critics
of
market
timing
argue
that
its
hard
if
not
impossible
to
consistently
beat
a
buyandhold
approach
by
jumping
back
and
forth
between
stocks
and
cash
but
new
research
raises
the
tantalizing
possibility
that
you
can
do
as
well
as
the
overall
market

with
much
less
risk

by
parking
your
portfolio
in
the
safety
of
cash
during
times
like
these
when
market
volatility
spikes
higher
market
timers
have
yet
to
translate
this
new
research
into
a
set
of
specific
rules
for
trading
but
the
general
idea
is
to
get
out
of
the
stock
market
whenever
volatility
measures

such
as
the
chicago
board
options
exchanges
volatility
index
known
as
the
vix

rise
significantly
and
to
stay
in
cash
until
they
come
back
down
of
course
such
a
volatilityavoidance
strategy
faces
long
odds
as
the
critics
of
market
timing
often
point
out
the
stock
market
tends
to
produce
the
bulk
of
its
gains
in
just
a
few
explosive
sessions
miss
those
days
and
your
portfolios
returns
are
likely
to
disappoint
you
consider
someone
who
was
fully
invested
in
stocks
over
the
last
decade

except
for
the
markets
20
best
days
during
which
he
held
cash
despite
holding
stocks
more
than
99
percent
of
the
time
this
investor
would
have
lost
57
percent
through
the
end
of
october
as
judged
by
the
dow
jones
wilshire
5000
index
a
benchmark
that
represents
the
combined
value
of
all
domestic
stocks
that
is
70
percentage
points
worse
than
the
13
percent
gain
he
would
have
achieved
had
he
held
stocks
mimicking
that
index
for
the
entire
10
years
including
the
markets
20
best
days
markettiming
advocates
say
its
unfair
to
focus
only
on
the
consequences
of
missing
the
very
best
days
because
the
bulk
of
the
markets
declines
are
also
concentrated
in
just
a
few
sessions
for
example
a
portfolio
fully
invested
in
stocks
during
all
but
the
20
worst
days
of
the
last
decade
would
have
gained
215
percent
thats
more
than
200
percentage
points
better
than
the
return
from
a
straightforward
buyandhold
approach
the
volatilityavoidance
strategy
takes
the
middle
ground
between
these
two
extremes
it
aims
to
sidestep
at
least
some
of
the
markets
biggest
down
days
and
is
willing
to
miss
some
of
the
biggest
up
days
too
because
the
best
and
worst
days
tend
to
balance
each
other
out
during
volatile
times
a
strategy
that
moves
your
portfolio
into
cash
during
such
periods
should
produce
longterm
returns
that
are
close
to
those
of
the
overall
market
while
incurring
much
less
risk
this
rough
equivalence
in
returns
has
prevailed
in
recent
years
over
the
last
decade
an
investor
who
was
out
of
the
stock
market
during
both
the
20
best
and
20
worst
days
would
have
gained
18
percent
thats
just
a
little
better
than
buying
and
holding
yet
the
volatility
of
this
investors
monthly
returns
would
have
been
9
less
than
the
markets
but
how
can
you
sidestep
even
a
good
portion
of
the
biggest
down
days
a
growing
body
of
academic
research
has
found
that
the
periods
of
greatest
volatility
are
in
large
part
predictable
this
means
that
the
market
sessions
with
particularly
good
or
bad
returns
dont
occur
randomly
but
tend
to
be
clustered
together
perhaps
the
researcher
most
widely
credited
with
documenting
this
tendency
is
robert
f
engle
a
finance
professor
at
new
york
university
who
was
the
nobel
laureate
in
economics
in
2003
for
his
work
along
these
lines
the
markets
behavior
over
the
last
couple
of
months
illustrates
this
clustering
by
sept
18
the
vix
the
widely
followed
volatility
index
had
climbed
to
what
was
then
its
highest
level
in
five
years
greatly
increasing
the
likelihood
that
the
ensuing
period
would
have
aboveaverage
volatility
sure
enough
nine
of
the
20
biggest
daily
percentage
losses
of
the
last
decade
occurred
in
the
subsequent
six
weeks
along
with
six
of
the
decades
20
biggest
daily
gains
but
even
if
theyre
successful
volatilityavoidance
strategies
arent
for
everyone
longterm
investors
for
example
presumably
dont
care
about
shorterterm
gyrations
and
therefore
arent
interested
in
markettiming
approaches
whose
major
benefit
is
reducing
volatility
rather
than
increasing
return
such
strategies
require
close
attention
to
the
market
and
generate
higher
costs
than
simply
holding
stocks
for
the
long
term
still
a
successful
volatilityavoidance
strategy
would
appeal
to
many
investors
who
have
been
scared
away
from
the
market
worried
that
they
would
suffer
through
more
extraordinary
fluctuations
like
those
of
recent
weeks
by
its
very
nature
innovation
is
inefficient
while
blockbusters
do
emerge
few
of
the
new
products
or
processes
that
evolve
from
innovative
thinking
ultimately
survive
the
test
of
time
during
periods
of
economic
growth
such
inefficiencies
are
chalked
up
as
part
of
the
price
of
forging
into
the
future
but
these
arent
such
times
wild
market
gyrations
frozen
credit
markets
and
an
overall
sour
economy
herald
a
new
round
of
corporate
belttightening
foremost
on
the
target
list
is
anything
inefficient
thats
bad
news
for
corporate
innovation
and
it
could
spell
trouble
for
years
to
come
even
after
the
economy
turns
around
to
be
honest
we
had
a
problem
with
innovation
even
before
the
economic
crisis
thats
the
reason
i
wrote
my
book
says
judy
estrin
former
chief
technology
officer
at
cisco
systems
and
author
of
closing
the
innovation
gap
were
focusing
on
the
short
term
and
were
not
planting
the
seeds
for
the
future
in
tough
times
of
course
many
companies
have
to
scale
back
but
she
says
to
quote
obama
you
dont
use
a
hatchet
you
use
a
scalpel
leaders
need
to
pick
and
choose
with
great
care
there
are
important
things
managers
can
do
to
ensure
that
creative
forwardthinking
doesnt
go
out
the
door
with
each
round
of
layoffs
fostering
a
companywide
atmosphere
of
innovation

encouraging
everyone
to
take
risks
and
to
think
about
novel
solutions
from
receptionists
to
cornersuite
executives

helps
ensure
that
the
loss
of
any
particular
set
of
minds
neednt
spell
trouble
for
the
entire
company
she
suggests
instilling
five
core
values
to
entrench
innovation
in
the
corporate
mindset
questioning
risktaking
openness
patience
and
trust
all
five
must
be
used
together

risktaking
without
questioning
leads
to
recklessness
she
says
while
patience
without
trust
sets
up
an
everymanforhimself
mentality
in
an
era
of
six
sigma
black
belts
and
brown
belts
estrin
urges
setting
aside
certain
efficiency
measures
in
favor
of
what
she
calls
greenthumb
leadership

a
futureoriented
management
style
that
understands
and
even
encourages
taking
risks
let
efficiency
measures
govern
the
existing
factory
farm
she
says
but
create
greenhouses
and
experimental
gardens
along
the
sides
of
the
farm
to
nurture
the
risky
investments
that
likely
will
take
a
number
of
years
to
bear
fruit
im
not
suggesting
you
only
cut
from
todays
stuff
and
keep
the
future
part
untouched
she
says
you
have
to
balance
it
yet
even
that
approach
has
its
drawbacks
companies
that
create
silos
of
innovation
by
designating
one
group
as
the
big
thinkers
while
making
others
handle
daytoday
concerns
risk
losing
their
innovative
edge
if
any
of
the
big
thinkers
leave
the
company
or
ultimately
must
be
laid
off
innovation
has
to
be
embedded
in
the
daily
operation
in
the
entire
work
force
says
jon
fisher
a
business
professor
serial
entrepreneur
and
author
of
strategic
entrepreneurism
which
advocates
building
a
startups
business
from
the
beginning
with
an
eye
toward
selling
the
company
a
large
acquirers
interest
in
a
startup
or
smaller
company
is
binary
in
nature
they
either
want
you
or
they
dont
based
on
the
innovation
you
have
to
offer
the
best
way
to
foster
innovation
is
to
create
something
put
it
to
the
test
build
a
good
company
and
then
get
it
under
the
umbrella
of
a
worldrenowned
company
to
move
it
forward
david
thompson
chief
executive
and
cofounder
of
geniuscom
inc
based
in
san
mateo
calif
says
that
innovation
has
a
bad
name
in
down
times
but
that
bad
times
focus
the
mind
and
the
bestfocused
minds
in
the
down
times
are
looking
for
the
opportunities
you
do
have
to
batten
down
the
hatches
and
reduce
expenses
but
you
cant
do
it
at
the
expense
of
the
big
picture
thompson
adds
you
always
have
to
keep
in
mind
the
bigger
picture
thats
coming
down
the
road
in
two
or
three
years
the
last
thing
you
want
to
do
with
innovation
is
just
throw
money
at
it
its
a
very
tricky
balance
in
fact
hard
times
can
be
the
source
of
innovative
inspiration
says
chris
shipley
a
technology
analyst
and
executive
producer
of
the
demo
conferences
where
new
ideas
make
their
debuts
some
of
the
best
products
and
services
come
out
of
some
of
the
worst
times
she
says
in
the
early
1990s
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
had
gone
down
the
drain
in
a
futile
effort
to
develop
pen
computing

an
early
phase
of
mobile
computing

and
a
recession
was
shriveling
the
economic
outlook
yet
the
tiny
palm
computing
managed
to
revitalize
the
entire
industry
in
a
matter
of
months
by
transforming
itself
overnight
from
a
software
maker
into
a
hardware
company
our
biggest
challenge
right
now
is
fear
she
says
the
worst
thing
that
a
company
can
do
right
now
is
go
into
hibernation
into
duckandcover
if
you
just
sit
on
your
backside
and
wait
for
things
to
get
better
theyre
not
going
to
theyre
going
to
get
better
for
somebody
but
not
necessarily
for
you
howard
lieberman
also
a
serial
entrepreneur
and
founder
of
the
silicon
valley
innovation
institute
says
innovation
breeds
effectiveness
its
not
about
efficiency
he
argues
efficiency
is
for
bean
counters
he
says
its
not
for
ceos
or
inventors
or
founders
the
current
economic
downturn
comes
as
no
surprise
to
him
he
says
because
it
mirrors
the
downturn
at
the
time
of
the
dotcom
bust
then
and
now
the
companies
that
survive
are
those
that
keep
creativity
and
innovation
foremost
creativity
doesnt
care
about
economic
downturns
lieberman
says
in
the
middle
of
the
1970s
when
we
were
having
a
big
economic
downturn
both
apple
and
microsoft
were
founded
creative
people
dont
care
about
the
time
or
the
season
or
the
state
of
the
economy
they
just
go
out
and
do
their
thing
marilyn
rubinson
recalls
her
stays
at
the
fontainebleau
hotel
as
a
series
of
highfashion
snapshots
there
were
afternoons
at
the
cabana
a
blue
hotel
towel
wrapped
around
my
head
like
a

and
wearing
highheeled
lucite
shoes
she
said
there
were
evenings
at
the

with

dashing

john

lindsay
and
she
remembers
sweeping
down
the
dramatic
lobby
staircase
in
a
formfitting
stonecolored
gown
in
those
days
everyone
made
an
entrance
rubinson
84
said
i
made
lots
of
entrances
in
that
heady
era
the
hotel
was
the
diadem
of
miami
resorts
a
560footlong
sickleshaped
showplace
dominating
the
collins
avenue
waterfront
where
miamians
like
the
rubinsons
who
own
a
chain
of
clothing
stores
and
welltodo
snowbirds
came
in
the
winter
to
roost
everyone
who
was
anyone
was
there
rubinson
said
people
wore
black
tie
and
jewelry
everyone
was
young
and
everyone
lived
large
at
the
flamboyant
resort
conceived
from
its
outset
to
evoke
a
modern
versailles
it
was
the
place
for
entertainment
for
glamour

an
icon
even
among
the
locals
said
cathy
leff
the
director
of
the
wolfsonian
museum
of
design
here
even
now
if
one
asks
within
the
city
of
miami
beach
what
is
the
most
important
landmark
in
the
popular
imagination
it
would
be
the
fontainebleau
can
an
icon
of
the
past
be
restored
to
its
former
glory
new
owners
and
architects
of
the
fontainebleau
have
invested
1
billion
to
buy
and
restore
it
in
the
conviction
that
it
can
its
original
fusion
of
modernist
rigor
and
hollywood
cheek
dreamed
up
by
the
maverick
architect
morris
lapidus
was
derided
as
bronx
baroque
until
the
singular
style
of
miami
beach
was
rediscovered
by
the
ian
schrager
generation
in
its
day
in
the
50s
and
60s
the
fontainebleau
was
state
of
the
art
in
glamour
said
jeffrey
beers
the
new
york
architect
responsible
for
an
extensive
update
of
the
interior
we
would
like
to
restore
that
in

visitors
will
be
able
to
judge
for
themselves
if
the
mission
succeeded
even
recently
as
the

it
was
clear
that
the

flounced
out
her

how
many

you

indeed
as

said
john

a

but
lancet
viewed
the
fontainebleau
development
as
only
mildly
risky
it
is
my
impression
that
the
owners
went
through
adequate
planning
so
that
the
risk
could
be
mitigated

that
the

was
made
in

that

golden
age
recall
a
resort
that
lapidus
who
died
in
2001
at
98
had
envisioned
as
a
laboratory
it
was
a
place
he
wrote
where
i
could
enlarge
upon
all
the
theories
i
had
been
developing
about
human
nature
and
the
emotional
hunger
that
the
average
man
had
for
visual
excitement
at
bars
and
supper
clubs

the

the
poodle

women
would
sit
with
their
little
fur

and

a

and
former

sheathed
in
slinky

they
would
stop
at

her

60s

remembers
the
resort
where
she
had
a
prom
and
her
wedding
as
my
stage
and
my
launching
pad
the
fontainebleau
was
a
decadent
paradise
of
flashy
diamonds
illicit
sex
and
overflowing
ice
cream
sodas
she
said
to
get
to
her
familys
cabana
you
had
to
walk
through
the
downstairs
shops
and
past
a
dance
studio
where
they
had
all
these
gorgeous

giving
chacha
lessons
to
all
these
overdressed
matrons
from

people
came
for

and
the
revues
she
said
and
of
course
for
trysts
i
knew
something
illicit
was
going
on
but
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
what
it
was
the

a
hub
for

spotting
the

backdrop
against
which
the
rat
pack
played
poker

i
sat
down

i
told
him
i
dont

my

i
just
want
to
look

rubinson
was
just
as
enthralled
by
her
frequent
star
sightings
how
many
times
driving
up
to
the
fontainebleau
i
would
see
frank
sinatra
walking
up
the
drive
with
a
glass
in
his
hand
she
said
we
had
a
more
glamorous
lifestyle
in
those
days
she
added
wistfully
but
then
of
course
things
changed
in
succeeding
decades
the
resort
lost
its
sparkle
like
other
supersize
hotels
lining
collins
avenue
north
of
44th
street
including
the
neighboring

another
shiny
lapidus
edifice
it
became
as
dated
as

fast
forward
to
the

we
kept
asking
ourselves
what
would

karawan
said
john

a
miami
architect
responsible
for
the
adjacent
fontainebleau
residential
towers
the
second
of
which
has
just

completed
was
hired
to
gut
and
redesign
the

he
preserved
lapidus
embellishments
like
the
perforated
swiss

outer

we
had
to
get
down
into
a
very
high

nichols
said
you
dont
just
go
in
there
and
take
off
the
eyebrows
oka
doner
said
she
admires
the
renovation

to
a
point
the
property
is
kind
of
postpostmodern
she
said
morris
lapidus
had
real
passion
but
in
its
current
incarnation
irony
has
trumped
passion
but
desilets
the
former
lapidus
associate
who
visited
the
site
last
month
was
over
the
moon
they
used
incredible
engineering
to
laser
trace
what
was
there
and
rebuilt
it
with
accuracy
she
said
its
going
to
be
like
a
ravenna
mosaic
its
a
wow
type
of
extravagance
the
exuberant
aesthetic
of
the
original
has
been
resurrected
in
three
ballrooms
lavish

five

the

recently
viewed
the

the
place
is
so
pretty
the
first
time
i
saw
it
i
thought
i
was
in
the
wrong
hotel
he
said
i
said
to
my
wife
just
take
a
look
at
what
money
can
do
as
a
senior
mortgage
underwriter
keysha
cooper
was
proud
of
her
ability
to
spot
fraud
and
other
problems
in
a
loan
application
a
decade
of
vetting
mortgage
documents
had
taught
her
plenty
she
says
but
as
a
senior
mortgage
underwriter
at
washington
mutual
during
the
late
great
mortgage
boom
cooper
says
she
found
herself
in
a
vise
brokers
squeezed
her
from
one
side
her
superiors
from
the
other
she
says
and
both
pressured
her
to
approve
loans
no
matter
what
at
wamu
it
wasnt
about
the
quality
of
the
loans
it
was
about
the
numbers
cooper
says
they
didnt
care
if
we
were
giving
loans
to
people
that
didnt
qualify
instead
it
was
how
many
loans
did
you
guys
close
and
fund
cooper
35
was
laid
off
a
year
ago
and
is
still
unemployed
she
came
forward
to
discuss
her
experiences
at
the
bank
to
help
shareholders
recover
money
from
wamu
executives
cooper
is
one
of
89
employees
whose
stories
fill
a
voluminous
complaint
filed
against
officers
of
the
company
by
the
ontario
teachers
pension
plan
board
a
big
shareholder
topping
the
list
of
defendants
is
kerry
k
killinger
the
wamu
chief
executive
who
was
ousted
in
midseptember
wamu
was
seized
by
federal
regulators
in
late
september
the
biggest
bank
failure
in
the
nations
history
it
was
sold
to
jpmorgan
chase
for
19
billion
the
shareholder
complaint
depicts
wamus
mortgage
lending
operation
as
a
boiler
room
where
volume
was
paramount
and
questionable
loans
were
pushed
through
because
they
were
more
profitable
to
the
company
when
underwriters
refused
to
approve
dubious
loans
they
were
punished
she
says
cooper
started
at
wamu
in
2003
and
lasted
three
and
a
half
years
at
first
she
was
allowed
to
do
her
job
she
says
in
february
2007
though
the
pressure
became
intense
wamu
executives
told
employees
they
were
not
making
enough
loans
and
had
to
get
their
numbers
up
she
says
they
started
giving
loan
officers
free
trips
if
they
closed
so
many
loans
fly
them
to
hawaii
for
a
month
cooper
recalls
one
of
my
account
reps
went
to
jamaica
for
a
month
because
he
closed
35
million
in
loans
that
month
although
cooper
couldnt
see
it
the
wheels
were
already
coming
off
the
subprime
bus
if
a
loan
came
from
a
top
loan
officer
they
didnt
care
what
the
situation
was
you
had
to
make
that
loan
work
she
says
you
were
like
a
bad
person
if
you
declined
a
loan
one
loan
file
was
filled
with
so
many
discrepancies
that
she
felt
certain
it
involved
mortgage
fraud
she
turned
the
loan
down
she
says
only
to
be
scolded
by
her
supervisor
she
told
me
this
broker
has
closed
over
1
million
with
us
and
there
is
no
reason
you
cannot
make
this
loan
work
cooper
says
i
explained
to
her
the
loan
was
not
good
at
all
but
she
said
i
had
to
sign
it
the
argument
did
not
end
there
however
cooper
says
her
immediate
boss
complained
to
the
team
manager
about
the
loan
rejection
and
asked
that
cooper
be
written
up
with
a
formal
letter
of
complaint
placed
in
her
personnel
file
cooper
said
the
team
manager
told
her
to
restructure
the
loan
to
make
it
work
i
said
how
can
you
restructure
fraud
this
is
a
fraudulent
loan
she
recalls
cooper
says
that
her
bosses
placed
her
on
probation
for
30
days
for
refusing
to
approve
the
loan
and
that
her
team
manager
signed
off
on
the
loan
four
months
later
the
loan
was
in
default
she
says
the
borrower
had
not
made
a
single
payment
they
tried
to
hang
it
on
me
cooper
said
but
i
said
no
i
put
in
the
system
that
i
am
not
approving
this
loan
brokers
often
tried
to
bribe
cooper
to
approve
loans
she
says
one
offered
to
pay
900
to
send
her
son
to
football
summer
boot
camp
if
she
would
approve
a
loan
that
had
been
declined
by
a
host
of
other
lenders
i
told
him
no
and
not
to
disrespect
me
like
that
again
cooper
says
hidden
fees
meant
brokers
could
easily
make
between
20000
and
40000
on
a
500000
loan
cooper
says
wamu
was
allowing
brokers
to
get
6
to
8
percent
off
one
loan
she
says
if
i
had
a
loan
where
the
borrower
was
already
tight
and
then
i
saw
the
broker
is
getting
10000
or
20000
i
would
cut
their
fees
back
they
would
get
so
upset
with
me
cooper
says
that
loans
she
turned
down
were
often
approved
by
her
superiors
one
in
particular
came
back
to
haunt
wamu
vetting
a
loan
one
day
cooper
says
she
became
suspicious
when
a
photograph
of
the
house
being
bought
showed
one
street
address
while
documents
deeper
in
the
file
showed
a
different
address
she
contacted
the
appraiser
and
recalls
that
he
said
that
he
must
have
erred
and
that
he
would
send
her
the
correct
documents
so
then
he
sent
me
an
appraisal
with
a
picture
of
the
same
house
but
this
time
with
the
right
number
on
it
cooper
recalls
i
looked
the
address
up
in
our
system
and
could
not
find
it
i
called
the
appraiser
and
said
please
investigate
the
appraiser
came
back
reporting
that
a
visit
to
the
california
property
had
found
everything
in
order
and
in
agreement
with
the
original
appraisal
i
was
so
for
sure
that
it
was
fraud
i
wanted
to
get
on
an
airplane
cooper
says
the
800000
loan
was
approved
but
not
by
cooper
six
months
later
it
defaulted
she
says
when
they
went
to
foreclose
on
the
house
they
found
it
was
an
empty
lot
she
recalls
i
remember
clear
as
day
this
manager
comes
over
to
me
and
asks
do
you
remember
this
loan
i
knew
just
what
she
was
talking
about
rejecting
loan
after
loan
however
gave
her
battle
fatigue
the
more
you
fight
the
more
you
get
in
trouble
she
says
she
was
written
up
three
or
four
times
at
wamu
after
wamus
mortgage
lending
unit
laid
her
off
she
applied
for
work
in
its
retail
banking
division
she
was
turned
down
she
suspects
because
of
the
critical
letters
in
her
personnel
file
coopers
biggest
regret
she
says
is
that
she
did
not
reject
more
loans
i
swear
60
percent
of
the
loans
i
approved
i
was
made
to
she
says
if
i
could
get
everyones
name
i
would
write
them
apology
letters

soon
i
loved

its
about
being

put
a
person
in

she
says
but
messing
these

around
was
wrong
it
is
1030
am
two
hours
before
the
florida
gators
will
kick
off
to
ole
miss
and
max
a
19yearold
freshman
is
laboring
to
explain
how
he
feels
about
the
drinking
age
personally
he
says
punching
out
each
slurred
syllable
i
do
agree
the
age
should
be
lowered
it
will
cut
down
on
binge
drinking
he
throws
an
arm
around
a
fraternity
brother
but
we
take
care
of
each
other
we
will
not
let
anyone
drink
under
the
influence
he
pauses
i
mean
drive
under
the

im
sorry
im
drunk
already
its
been
a
long
morning
max
and
his

are
pregaming
a

of
them

of

on
the

row
each
nursing
a
cold
beer
in
a
foam
hugger
a
frisbee
flies
as
jimi
hendrix
blares
from
the
loudspeakers
the
only
thing
unusual
about
this
days
pregaming
is
that
it
actually
precedes
a
game
in
the
two
decades
since
the
legal
drinking
age
was
raised
to
21
the
term
has
come
to
encompass
any
rapid
consumption
of
alcohol
in
private
before
venturing
out
to
venues
where
drinking
may
not
be
possible
this
assumes
that
alcohol
is
readily
available
to
underage
college
students
which
of
course
it
is
as
ever
older
students
provide
liquor
to
friends
who
are
younger
and
fake
ids
remain
as
pervasive
on
campus
as
sweatpants
though
college
drinking
levels
have
declined
slightly
from
peaks
in
the
early
1980s
surveys
find
that
more
than
8
in
10
college
students
drink
and
that
4
in
10
are
binge
drinkers
meaning
that
in
the
previous
two
weeks
a
man
had
consumed
at
least
five
drinks
in
a
sitting
or
a
woman
four
here
in
gainesville
binge
drinking
remains
ritualized
behavior
for
many
of
the
51000
students
even
as
admission
to
the
university
has
become
increasingly
selective
whether
or
not
the
university
deserves
its
princeton
review
ranking
as
this
years
best
party
school
few
in
this
classic
college
town
find
it
outlandish
that
the
gators
have
placed
in
the
top
20
four
years
running
to
walk
the
campus
and
environs
on
a
football
weekend
is
to
navigate
an
endless
river
of
alcohol
from
the
flowing
taps
of
the
swamp
restaurant
a
popular
hangout
near
the
stadium
to
the
offcampus
bungalow
on
northwest
second
avenue
that
houses
one
of
the
worlds
larger
beer
bongs
college
presidents
while
philosophical
about
the
historical
bonds
between
academe
and
alcohol
are
immensely
frustrated
by
the
universal
flouting
of
the
law
and
the
persistence
of
binge
drinking
each
year
they
see
its
tragic
consequences
in
the
form
of
alcohol
poisonings
drunkendriving
arrests
date
rapes
and
barroom
brawls
even
at
universities
like
florida
that
make
aggressive
efforts
at
enforcement
and
education
administrators
say
they
believe
success
is
limited
to
the
margins
and
so
this
summer
130
exasperated
college
presidents
many
from
the
countrys
most
prestigious
institutions
boldly
shifted
the
debate
by
calling
for
a
reexamination
of
the
drinking
age
in
july
they
signed
a
manifesto
declaring
that
21
is
not
working
and
asserting
that
a
culture
of
dangerous
clandestine
bingedrinking

often
conducted
off
campus

has
developed
in
their
open
letter
labeled
the
amethyst
initiative
after
the
violet
gemstone
thought
by
the
greeks
to
ward
off
intoxication
they
did
not
explicitly
call
for
lowering
the
age
from
21
but
the
efforts
organizer
john
m
mccardell
jr
the
former
president
of
middlebury
college
directs
a
nonprofit
group
that
calls
for
licensing
drinkers
as
young
as
18
like
drivers
they
would
first
have
to
pass
a
course
on
responsible
alcohol
use
polls
have
found
little
support
for
lowering
the
drinking
age
but
with
surveys
showing
that
threefourths
of
high
school
seniors
have
consumed
alcohol
mccardell
argues
that
the
law
is
so
meaningless
as
to
breed
disrespect
his
proposal
he
says
would
provide
a
mechanism
for
educating
youth
on
the
perils
of
binge
drinking
while
removing
the
forbiddenfruit
incentive
that
he
says
contributes
to
it
if
you
assume
and
i
think
you
have
to
assume
that
alcohol
is
a
reality
in
the
lives
of
18
19
and
20yearolds
then
youve
got
two
choices
mccardell
says
you
can
try
to
change
the
reality
weve
been
trying
to
do
that
for
24
years
and
havent
been
that
successful
that
leaves
creating
the
safest
possible
environment
for
the
reality
and
theres
plenty
of
evidence
to
support
that
21
doesnt
do
that
he
adds
we
cant
know
that
18
would
improve
binge
drinking
but
we
cant
know
that
it
would
fail
either
if
we
were
able
to
draw
one
atrisk
life
out
of
the
shadows
and
into
the
sunlight
would
the
change
be
worth
it
it
is
not
a
rhetorical
question
one
recent
government
study
estimated
that
1700
college
students
die
each
year
in
alcoholrelated
incidents
more
than
599000
are
injured
and
more
than
97000
are
victims
of
an
alcoholfueled
sexual
assault
or
date
rape
in
recent
surveys
by
the
university
of
floridas
health
care
center
about
a
third
of
students
said
they
had
blacked
out
from
heavy
drinking
in
the
past
year
half
said
they
had
vomited
a
fourth
said
they
had
gotten
into
an
alcoholrelated
fight
and
more
than
a
fifth
reported
driving
under
the
influence
but
alexander
c
wagenaar
a
university
of
florida
epidemiologist
who
has
studied
the
drinking
age
for
more
than
two
decades
says
mccardell
ignores
evidence
that
raising
the
age
has
saved
lives
especially
on
the
roads
the
national
highway
transportation
safety
administration
estimates
that
despite
poor
adherence
to
drinking
age
restrictions
each
year
about
900
fewer
people
die
because
the
legal
age
is
21
after
assessing
48
studies
wagenaar
concluded
the
preponderance
of
evidence
suggests
that
higher
drinking
ages
reduce
alcohol
consumption
furthermore
he
says
there
is
no
statistical
evidence
that
binge
drinking
increases
along
with
the
rising
legal
age
or
that
it
will
decline
with
a
drop
indeed
an
annual
university
of
michigan
survey
shows
that
binge
drinking
among
college
students
actually
peaked
in
1984
and
has
fallen
since
albeit
slightly
as
it
happens
that
is
the
year
congress
threatened
to
reduce
highway
money
for
states
that
did
not
raise
the
drinking
age
to
21
most
of
the
country
had
designated
21
as
the
drinking
age
after
prohibition
then
29
states
lowered
it
during
the
early
1970s
when
18yearold
draftees
were
being
shipped
to
vietnam
studies
soon
showed
an
increase
in
traffic
accidents
among
teenagers
and
by
1988
all
states
had
returned
to
21

patricia
tellesirvin
bluntly
rejected
the
initiative
in
an
oped
piece
in
the
st
petersburg
times
there
was
no
evidence
they
wrote
that
the
21
age
limit
encouraged
more
clandestine
binge
drinking
than
it
discouraged
and
every
reason
to
think
that
lowering
the
age
might
exacerbate
the
problem
does
anyone
really
think
that
if
18yearolds
could
buy
alcohol
the
social
passport
conferred
by
heavy
drinking
would
lose
its
cachet
they
asked
there
has
been

to
celebrate

academically
the

is
becoming
more
selective
in
its
admissions
with
a
lotteryfinanced
scholarship
program
providing
free
tuition
to
almost
all
instate
freshmen
the
university
is
twice
as
selective
as
it
was
15
years
ago
admitting
fewer
than
4
in

applicants
the
percentage
of

scoring
at

a
600
on

soared

percent
in

machen
had
not
planned
on
becoming
a
crusader
against
binge
drinking
when
he
left
the
presidency
of
the
university
of
utah
where
alcohol
was
hardly
a
problem
he
had
spent
much
of
his
career
as
a
dean
of
dentistry
and
the
florida
trustees
had
hired
him
to
focus
on
graduate
education
and
academic
ranking
but
in
his
first
two
years
in
gainesville
six
students
died
in
alcoholrelated
incidents

one
from
alcohol
poisoning
two
in
falls
two
in
traffic
accidents
and
one
in
a
fight
as
he
met
their
families
he
started
to
take
the
waste
of
promise
personally
thats
when
i
said
wait
a
minute
machen
says
the
intensity
of
those
interactions
made
me
want
to
take
some
effort
in
this
area
it
wasnt
anything
i
wanted
to
do
to
be
honest
a
lot
of
presidents
are
counseled
against
doing
this
because
of
the
negative
interactions
you
have
with
the
student
body
but
we
thought
we
had
to
machen
fears
that
floridas
partyschool
reputation
is
holding
back
its
academic
ambition
but
he
is
realistic
about
his
ability
to
alter
a
deeply
ingrained
culture
he
emphasizes
that
he
is
not
into
abstinence
and
that
he
supports
responsible
drinking
as
part
of
a
students
preparation
for
life
but
seeing
what
he
has
seen
he
cannot
wave
the
white
flag
the
ones
who
are
in
danger
of
being
habitually
affected
by
it
are
the
ones
wed
like
to
get
after
he
says
i
think
maybe
at
the
margin
for
the
really
significantly
affected
kids
we
might
make
some
difference
machen

watched
his

rate
drop

to
38
percent
last
spring
from
57
percent
in
fall
2004

as
the
university
has
toughened
enforcement
mandated
alcohol
education
and
banned
beer
advertising
among
other
initiatives
a
number
of
other
colleges
have
taken
similar

approaches
and
a

alcohol
on

altogether
it
is
allowed
at
the

but
in
september
the
trustees
clarified
longstanding

against
commonsource
containers

as

florida
students
who
arrived
as

in

had
an
arrest
record
by

end
of

usually
for
an
alcohol
offense
a

spokesman
says
that
it
does
not
keep
such
records
but
that
kheys
estimate
seems
high
offenders
facing
the

may
have
to
sit

perform

service
with
suspensions

reserved

serious

underage

caught

typically
face
a
fine
of
75

125
possession
of
a
fake
or
doctored
drivers
license
is
a
felony
as
a
result
students
have
learned
it
is
wiser
to
borrow

or
buy

a
drivers
license
from
an
older
friend
who
bears
a
vague
resemblance
as
possession
of
another
persons
id
is
only
a
misdemeanor
some
students
say
the
risk
is
manageable
its
effortless
to
get
a
drink
in
a
bar
says
lydia
a
snyder
22

graduate
student

also
attended
florida
as
an
undergraduate
i
had
a
fake
id
and
got
turned
away
once
in
five
years
for
others
the
threat
of
a
criminal
record
is
sufficient
to
deter
them
in
public
and
so
they
pregame
instead
doing
their
heaviest
drinking
behind
closed
doors
before
heading
to
a
bar
or
club
you
want
to
get
drunk
enough
to
last
your
time
at
the
bar

joe
d
alleva

19yearold
freshman
from
daytona
beach

you

supply
and

also
dictates
that
minors
drink
quickly
and
heavily
says
justin
a
willems
an
18yearold
freshman
if
youre
under
21
and
go
to
a
party
and
theres
alcohol
he
says
you
dont
know
when
youre
going
to
see
it
again
students
seem
to
universally
agree
that
the
current
law
is
ineffectual
and
that
it
may
encourage
binge
drinking
with
18
19
and
20yearolds
serving
overseas
once
again
they
wonder
why
someone
old
enough
to
fight
is
not
old
enough
to
drink
but
they
also
question
whether
they
would
drink
any
less
if
the
age
was
18
theres
some
truth
that
when
youre
underage
youre
a
little
more
cautious
snyder
says
lowering
the
drinking
age
would
just

a
number
is
really
going
to
stop
binge
drinking
heavy
drinking
the
students
say
is
simply
part
of
college
culture
and
buying
alcohol
by
the
keg
or
sixpack
has
one
appeal
that
transcends
age
it
is
cheaper
than
buying

gift
baskets
which
included
head
lamps
flashlights
walkietalkies
and
other
items
better
suited
for
construction
workers
than
tearyeyed
guests
but
this
was
a
farm
wedding
without
hotellike
amenities
and
the

from

calif
wanted
to
make
the
30
or
so
friends
and
relatives
staying
the
weekend
as
comfortable
as
possible
unfortunately
they
forgot
about
the
bats
there
were
eight
bats
in
our
cabin
and
we
had
no
idea
how
to
get
them
out
said
julia

29
who
was
rooming
with
her
boyfriend
and
three
other

one
of
us
had
a
head
lamp
on
so
they
were
flying
in

faces
we
opened

weddings
celebrated
at
farms
are
not
exactly
new
but
just
as
the
wine
craze
decades
ago
sparked
a
vineyard
wedding
industry
the
green
crusade
with
its
emphasis
on
organic
and
local
products
seems
to
be
spurring
interest
in
farms
as
the
ideal
venue
for
vows
but
these
weddings
are
not
for
every
bride
and
groom
the
couple
must
want
not
only
an
outdoor
setting
but
also
a
close

some
might
say
too
close

connection
with
the
land
while
working
farms
may
offer
romantic
sunsets
over
golden
fields
and
truly
local
organic
food
and
flowers
couples
must
also
be
game
for
some
rural
challenges
like
uncertain
electricity
and
plumbing
and
the
occasional
runaway
chicken
or
pig
not
to
mention
a
family
of
bats
in
other
words
bridezillas
need
not
bother
if
youre
the
kind
of
person
who
wants
everything
to
work
out
exactly
right
i
wouldnt
let
you
have
it
here
said
judy
lessler
the
owner
of
harlands
creek
farm
a
historic
site
in
pittsboro
nc
which
she
is
preparing
for
weddings
starting
next
year
this
venue
is
for
people
who
like
the
outdoors
love
the
romance
of
it
and
are
willing
to
be
somewhat
flexible
the
farm
as
a
wedding
site
owes
much
to
agritourism
about
50000
farms
or
roughly
2
percent
of
all
farming
operations
in
the
country
were
open
to
the
public
in
2004
offering
weddings
lodging
hayrides
and
horseback
riding
according
to
a
survey
released
last
year
by
the
department
of
agriculture
the
survey
is
the
first
to
quantify
farmbased
recreation
while
some
farms
hold
only
a
few
weddings
a
year
others
cant
keep
up
with
demand
krugers
farm
on
a
river
island
near
portland
ore
started
holding
weddings
six
years
ago
and
as
many
as
50
weddings
are
now
held
there
annually
it
has
requests
for
three
times
that
many
said
don
kruger
the
owner
the
response
has
been
startling
kruger
said
its
kind
of
an
earthy
crowd
in
their
20s
and
30s
educated
who
have
very
strong
leanings
toward
the
environment
millie
martini
bratten
editor
in
chief
of
brides
magazine
said
that
while
the
majority
of
weddings
still
take
place
in
traditional
sites
like
restaurants
and
country
clubs
her
magazine
regularly
receives
wedding
submissions
set
in
farms
and
ranches
people
want
a
relaxed
atmosphere
and
they
want
to
have
fun
said
jane
eckert
an
agritourism
consultant
who
last
summer
launched
ruralbountycom
a
database
of
farms
ranches
wineries
and
other
sites
open
to
the
public
schatz
30
and
pontius
38
who
invited
140
guests
were
also
drawn
to
the
idea
that
all
their
organic
flowers
salad
greens
herbs
and
apples
for
pies
in
lieu
of
the
wedding
cake
were
grown
at
oz
farm
which
is
host
to
a
few
weddings
a
year
we
wanted
to
support
a
farm
that
does
this
organic
work
rather
than
have
the
money
going
to
a
hotel
said
schatz
a
fiction
writer
who
lectures
at
the
university
of
california
santa
cruz
schatz
and
pontius
a
web
designer
also
liked
the
laidback
attitude
they
could
decorate
any
way
they
wanted
sing
karaoke
in
the
barn
as
late
as
they
wished
and
generally
have
the
run
of
the
place
we
spent
half
the
time
on
a
river
drinking
beer
pontius
said
farm
weddings
can
cost
a
fraction
of
nuptials
at
more
traditional
sites
because
couples
usually
take
care
of
services
like
catering
and
music
and
small
farmers
like
pulling
out
the
haycovered
welcome
wagon
because
it
helps
them
survive
this
is
the
future
said
kruger
noting
these
activities
provide
a
third
of
kruger
farms
net
income
its
what
farms
are
doing
to
try
to
make
it
at
oz
farm
weddings
and
retreats
provide
half
the
farms
revenues
its
been
a
big
help

boyd
who

farms
trying
to
expand
their
operations
beyond
the
strictly
agricultural
sometimes
face
opposition
from
neighbors
or
county
officials
worried
about
issues
like
increased

thiokol
the

military
contracting
giant
he
was
working
at
home
on
a
saturday
morning
in
2005
poring
over
dozens
of
files
the
email
message
showed
that
atk
was
warned
years
earlier
that
a
military
flare
it
produced
might
endanger
american
soldiers
using
it
i
thought
oh
my
god
dye
recalls
i
couldnt
believe
that
we
knew
as
far
as
he
could
tell
the
company
had
ignored
the
warning
at
the
time
dye
an

at
atk
was
investigating
the
safety
of
flares
that
his
company
sold
to
the
us
army
and
air
force
what
he
found
led
him
to
file
a
lawsuit
contending
that
atk
cheated
taxpayers
by
selling
fragile
flares
and
by
doing
so
knowingly
put
soldiers
at
risk
the

3footlong

hot
enough
to

in

lawsuit

which
seeks
to
recover
tens
of
millions
of

atk
says
the

is
baseless
atk
has
determined
the
allegations
made
by
the
department
of
justice
in
the
ongoing
lawsuit
to
be
wholly
without
merit
the
company
says
but
dye
has
a
different
opinion
ethics
and
values
got
thrown
out
the
window
when
there
was
a
lot
of
money
at
stake
he
says
the
defense
department
pays
more
than
408
billion
for
goods
and

watchdog
groups
and
some

have
raised
concerns
about
the

ability
to
monitor

that
spending
a
report
to
congress
in
march
by
the

own
inspector
general
warned
of
an
increasing
gap
between

which
results
in
a
corresponding
increase
in
risk
for
fraud
waste
and
abuse
should
the
government
win
at
trial
in
the
lawsuit
against

it
may
be
entitled

recover
three
times
its

dyes
lawyers
estimate
that
the
total
could
reach
well
into
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
that
the
government
chose
to
join
dyes
lawsuit

the
justice
department
is
not
obligated
to
take
up
whistleblower
claims

suggests
that
the
case
is
a
strong
one
said
danielle
brian
executive
director
of
the
project
on
government
oversight
a
washington
watchdog
group
it
means
that
the
government
believes
that
the
company
knew
that
they
were
providing
faulty
products
brian
said
this
isnt
a
mistake
its
willfully
making
money
off
endangering
soldiers
i
cant
imagine
anything
worse
for
decades
atk
has
sold
versions
of
its
flares
not
only
to
the
us
government
but
also
to
the
armed
forces
of
other
countries
including
canada
italy
colombia
and
spain
the
devices
cost
at
least
700
each
and
contracts
for
bulk
purchases
totaled
millions
of
dollars
in
the
late
1990s
military
buyers
complained
that
too
often
the
flares
failed
to
ignite
atk
which
has
a
huge
complex
in
the
open
spaces
of
northern
utah
permitted
a
team
of
engineering
students
at
utah
state
university
to
design
an
improved
igniter
the
relationship
developed
after
the
university
approached
atk
seeking
realworld
projects
for
its
students
the
company
like
others
in
the
industry
often
joined
with
universities
to
conduct
research
because
the
ignition
mechanism
was
a
relatively
simple
mechanical
device
that
used
no
proprietary
technology
atk
officials
thought
that
the
project
offered
a
lowrisk
learning
experience
the
students
under
the
supervision
of
their
professors
came
up
with
a
system
that
used
the
force
of
a
flares
opening
parachute
to
snap
a
polycarbonate
plastic
bar
about
half
an
inch
long
and
a
tenth
of
an
inch
thick
when
the
plastic
broke
it
activated
a
series
of
reactions
that
ignited
the
propellant
the
students
never
tested
the
new
system
to
see
whether
the
flares
might
ignite
if
they
were
dropped
or
accidentally
jostled
they
couldnt
conduct
such
a
test
because
they
did
not
have
access
to
complete
live
flares
specifications
called
for
the
flares
to
be
able
to
withstand
a
fall
of
10
feet
without
igniting
atk
didnt
perform
those
socalled
drop
tests
either
the
company
contends
that
the
flares
had
been
used
for
a
long
time
without
any
problems
and
so
neither
the
company
nor
its
customers
were
concerned
about
accidental
ignition
the
company
began
shipping
flares
with
the
new
igniter
in
2000
according
to
government
court
filings
the
air
force
tested
the
flares
for
reliability
at
eglin
air
force
base
in
florida
in
june
2000
launching
them
from
warplanes
the
flares
ignited
97
percent
of
the
time
exceeding
the
air
forces
goal
but
the
air
force
did
not
perform
tests
to
see
whether
the
flares
might
accidentally
ignite
if
dropped
citing
pending
litigation
an
air
force
spokesman
declined
to
comment
lawyers
for
atk
contend
that
the
armed
forces
waived
tests
that
would
have
determined
whether
the
flares
could
meet
the
10foot
standard
they
have
further
argued
that
without
the
results
of
those
tests
the
government
could
not
claim
that
the
flares
were
flawed
the
first
report
of
a
potential
problem
surfaced
in
2005
after
the
us
government
and
the
armed
forces
of
other
countries
had
been
buying
the
redesigned
flares
for
five
years
the
navy
evaluating
whether
to
buy
the
devices
simulated
accidentally
dropping
the
flares
letting
them
fall
from
40
feet
they
ignited
on
hitting
the
ground
flares
also
ignited
after
falling
30
feet
and
20
feet
the
navy
found
yet
it
was
still
possible
that
the
flares
met
the
10foot
standard
even
if
they
did
not
meet
the
navys
more
stringent
40foot
requirement
it
was
up
to
dye
who
had
recently
been
named
manager
of
atks
flare
program
in
utah
to
figure
out
what
was
going
on
dye
54
a
tall
man
with
gray
hair
and
a
neatly
trimmed
mustache
was
a
21year
veteran
at
atk
he
joined
one
of
the
companys
predecessors
after
finishing
college
and
after
a
threeyear
stint
in
the
army
as
a
mechanic
fixing
things
suited
his
temperament
methodical
logical
exacting
first
he
said
he
asked
an
engineer
to
analyze
how
much
of
a
fall
that
critical
piece
of
plastic
in
the
igniter
could
survive
dye
thought
that
perhaps
the
plastic
could
be
strengthened
to
meet
the
navys
requirement
instead
he
was
stunned
by
the
answer
he
says
he
got
from
the
engineer
it
could
snap
after
a
fall
of
11
inches

not
11
feet
but
11
inches
dye
decided
to
test
the
flares
directly
the
company
says
he
never
sought
approval
to
conduct
the
tests
and
didnt
document
the
results
properly
according
to
court
documents
on
nov
9
2005
he
and
several
colleagues
took
five
flares
to
a
testing
site
in
atks
complex
they
dropped
a
flare
from
10
feet
it
ignited
they
dropped
a
flare
from
five
feet
it
ignited
too
by
the
end
of
the
day
dye
and
a
safety
engineer
had
warned
employees
to
keep
clear
of
the
flares
production
stopped
that
afternoon
the
company
convened
a
war
room
of
about
a
dozen
experts
to
investigate
the
flares
dye
said
and
he
was
part
of
the
team
no
formal
notice
was
given
to
buyers
of
the
flares
atk
asserts
that
a
company
official
informally
advised
an
air
force
representative
no
one
dye
said
wanted
him
to
perform
any
more
tests
in
his
view
there
were
simple
questions
that
atk
had
to
answer
to
identify
the
extent
of
the
problem
for
starters
if
the
companys
contracts
for
years
had
required
flares
to
survive
a
10foot
drop
test
he
said
did
we
do
the
test
or
did
we
not
do
the
test
no
one
he
said
seemed
to
know
two
days
after
his
drop
tests
dye
asked
a
secretary
for
the
keys
to
the
office
where
copies
of
contracts
were
kept
he
took
the
files
covering
the
period
shortly
before
and
after
the
introduction
of
the
new
igniter
and
brought
them
to
the
windowless
conference
room
where
the
team
was
working
dye
says
he
remembered
saying
we
need
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
happened
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
carried
the
files
to
his
pickup
for
the
45minute
drive
from
the
desert
to
his
house
and
that
night
he
started
reading
dye
and
his
wife
of
24
years
elizabeth
live
here
in
north
ogden
about
50
miles
north
of
salt
lake
city
the
house
is
remarkably
neat
orderly
and
full
of
evidence
of
dyes
disciplined
projectoriented
approach
to
life
he
built
woodedged
glass
boxes
for
three
dolls
on
a
shelf
above
one
doorway
behind
the
house
sits
the
hot
tub
that
he
installed
in
the
garage
he
keeps
the
power
drill
saw
and
other
tools
that
he
uses
for
those
projects
and
on
that
saturday
in
2005
his
project
was
reviewing
the
files
related
to
the
flare
program
among
the
documents
was
a
printout
of
an
email
message
sent
in
2000
by
ray
w
beus
then
the
atk
test
engineer
assigned
to
evaluate
and
report
to
his
supervisors
about
an
aspect
of
the
studentdesigned
igniter
in
the
message
beus
warned
about
a
more
realistic
scenario
which
might
present
a
significant
hazard
to
equipmentpersonnel
if
the
flare
assembly
receives
a
significant
impact
ie
dropped
i
can
foresee
the
plastic
restraint
in
the
igniter
breaking
he
wrote
resulting
in
complete
ignition
of
the
flare
beus
recommended
performing
drop
tests
to
gauge
the
safety
of
the
flares
with
the
new
igniter
then
he
added
you
can
relax
rest
assured
i
did
not
include
this
commentrecommendation
in
the
memo
although
i
would
like
to
have
but
according
to
the
government
no
drop
tests
had
been
performed
and
the
company
had
not
passed
along
beus
concerns
or
recommendation
to
the
air
force
in
2003
the
company
conducted
an
abbreviated
test
of
a
single
flare
according
to
the
government
but
the
test
controlled
the
angle
at
which
the
flare
hit
the
ground
beus
still
works
at
atk
according
to
the
company
atk
declined
to
make
him
available
for
an
interview
citing
the
pending
litigation
and
beus
did
not
return
phone
calls
after
finding
the
email
message
dye
said
he
called
his
supervisor
robert
winter
the
director
of
flare
and
decoy
programs
he
listened
to
me
read
it
dye
said
referring
to
the
message
there
was
like
a
pause
and
he
said
keep
that
close
to
your
chest
i
knew
what
he
meant
dont
tell
anybody
atk
has
strongly
denied
that
anyone
at
the
company
told
dye
to
keep
quiet
the
company
again
citing
the
pending
litigation
did
not
make
winter
available
for
an
interview
and
he
did
not
return
calls
to
his
office
over
that
weekend
dye
said
he
continued
reviewing
files
but
found
nothing
as
significant
as
the
beus
email
message
unable
to
sleep
dye
rose
well
before
dawn
on
monday
loaded
the
box
of
files
into
his
truck
and
headed
back
to
atks
complex
at
the
office
he
assembled
copies
of
documents
to
distribute
to
everyone
in
the
war
room
dye
said
he
did
not
share
beus
email
message
because
winter
had
told
him
not
to
the
atk
team
was
not
focused
on
determining
just
how
fragile
the
flares
were
dye
said
instead
he
said
his
colleagues
looked
to
see
whether
a
thirdparty
supplier
might
have
modified
the
flares
and
thus
introduced
a
defect
they
went
to
the
end
of
that
road
dye
said
and
the
buck
could
not
be
passed
atk
denies
that
the
company
tried
to
avoid
responsibility
a
week
after
dye
first
conducted
the
drop
tests
atk
sent
a
letter
to
customers
advising
them
that
the
flares
may
be
more
sensitive
than
specifications
allowed
if
dropped
dye
was
furious
i
objected
to
that
letter
he
said
it
had
no
mention
of
an
11inch
possibility
a
few
weeks
later
the
army
and
the
air
force
notified
atk
that
they
would
not
accept
6085
flares
that
had
been
manufactured
and
awaited
delivery
the
company
says
it
retrofitted
the
flares
on
its
own
dime
modifying
the
igniter
and
delivered
them
atk
says
the
modified
flares
met
the
10foot
requirement
in
the
weeks
after
he
found
the
beus
memo
dye
said
he
grew
increasingly
concerned
that
the
company
was
not
going
to
fix
flares
equipped
with
the
igniter
he
had
tested
he
decided
to
find
a
way
to
tell
the
government
what
he
had
found
and
on
the
web
he
learned
of
the
false
claims
act
that
federal
law
permits
private
individuals
to
sue
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
if
they
believe
that
they
have
inside
knowledge
of
fraud
against
the
government
at
first
the
lawsuits
are
kept
secret
under
court
seal
while
investigators
look
into
the
accusations
and
decide
whether
to
join
the
case
if
the
government
intervenes
and
recovers
money
the
whistleblower
can
receive
up
to
30
percent
of
the
amount
dye
also
found
the
web
site
for
phillips
ampamp
cohen
a
law
firm
specializing
in
whistleblower
cases
he
filled
out
an
online
application
and
asked
for
representation
i
felt
like
the
only
avenue
i
had
was
to
go
outside
dye
says
he
said
that
he
was
not
motivated
by
money
and
when
asked
what
he
would
do
if
he
received
millions
from
the
lawsuit
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
said
he
would
like
a
snowmobile
eric
r
havian
a
lawyer
at
the
firm
who
is
representing
dye
said
he
could
not
recall
another
case
involving
such
large
dollar
amounts
that
had
evidence
like
the
beus
email
message
you
dont
see
those
kinds
of
documents
very
often
he
says
the
law
firm
filed
a
complaint
under
seal
in
april
2006
within
a
month
despite
havians
warnings
that
no
lawsuit
was
a
sure
thing
dye
notified
atk
that
he
intended
to
quit
i
just
couldnt
go
out
and
play
the
game
of
looking
my
bosses
in
the
eye
dye
said
even
though
no
one
at
the
company
then
knew
that
he
was
working
with
the
government
the
justice
department
investigated
dyes
case
and
decided
to
join
it
just
over
a
year
later
justice
department
lawyers
declined
to
comment
on
the
atk
case
but
the
agencys
subsequent
examinations
of
atks
flare
program
turned
up
more
unsettling
information
according
to
court
documents
for
example
the
government
contends
that
when
atk
began
shipping
flares
with
the
new
igniter
in
2000
the
company
did
not
advise
one
customer
the
canadian
government
of
the
change
atk
says
the
canadian
government
was
notified
the
government
also
contends
that
when
the
canadian
government
asked
about
the
igniter
an
atk
official
responded
that
the
igniter
was
the
standard
in
the
united
states
and
had
been
tested
by
the
air
force
but
the
air
force
tests
at
the
eglin
base
had
not
yet
taken
place
at
the
time
the
flares
were
delivered
and
in
any
event
did
not
include
a
10foot
drop
test
the
lawyers
wrote
in
negotiations
with
the
us
army
over
additional
flare
purchases
the
company
cited
the
sale
to
canada
as
evidence
of
the
flare
design
suitability
justice
department
lawyers
wrote
in
this
way
the
lawyers
contended
atk
misled
the
army
into
waiving
testing
requirements
atk
responded
that
there
was
no
deception
atk
appears
ready
to
wage
war
in
court
and
has
challenged
each
claim
made
by
the
government
the
company
has
asserted
that
because
the
government
waived
the
drop
test
it
could
not
claim
that
the
flares
would
have
failed
and
in
court
arguments
in
may
an
atk
lawyer
dismissed
the
significance
of
the
beus
email
message
it
doesnt
say
that
the
flares
fail
to
meet
a
performance
spec
or
any
other
contract
requirement
or
even
that
he
thinks
they
do

performed
he
doesnt
say
there
is
a
contractually
required
test
or
for
that
matter
any
other
test
that
was
performed
improperly
it
is
not
clear
how
many
of
the
thousands
of
flares
at
issue
in
the
lawsuit
are
still
in
use
around
the
world
the
us
army
stopped
using
them
according
to
justice
department
lawyers
and
the
air
force
restricted
them
to
emergency
combat
use
lawyers
for
dye
say
the
government
has
mothballed
at
least
40000
flares
so
far
atk
has
retrofitted
igniters
in
14
flares
that
were
sold
to
chile
and
about
5000
sold
to
canada
according
to
a
spokesman
and
the
company
has
offered
to
retrofit
at
cost
the
igniters
in
tens
of
thousands
of
flares
sold
to
the
us
government
the
trial
is
set
to
begin
in
2010

his
uncle
his

arie
versendaal
spent
decades
working
at
the
maytag
factory
here
turning
coils
of
steel
into
washing
machines
when
the
plant
closed
last
year
taking
1800
jobs
out
of
this
town
of
16000
people
it
seemed
a
familiar
story
of
american
industrial
decline
another
company
town
brought
to
its
knees
by
the
vagaries
of
global
trade
except
that
versendaal
has
a
new
factory
job
at
a
plant
here
that
makes
blades
for
turbines
that
turn
wind
into
electricity
across
the
road
in
the
old
maytag
factory
another
company
is
building
concrete
towers
to
support
the
massive
turbines
together
the
two
plants
are
expected
to
employ
nearly
700
people
by
early
next
year
lifes
not
over
versendaal
says
for
35
years
i
pounded
my
body
to
the
ground
now
i
feel
like
im
doing
something
beneficial
for
mankind
and
the
united
states
weve
got
to
get
used
to
depending
on
ourselves
instead
of
something
else
and
wind
is
free
the
wind
is
blowing
out
there
for
anybody
to
use
from
the
faded
steel
enclaves
of
pennsylvania
to
the
reeling
auto
towns
of
michigan
and
ohio
state
and
local
governments
are
aggressively
courting
manufacturing
companies
that
supply
wind
energy
farms
solar
electricity
plants
and
factories
that
turn
crops
into
diesel
fuel
this
courtship
has
less
to
do
with
the
loftiest
aims
of
renewable
energy
proponents

curbing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
lessening
american
dependence
on
foreign
oil

and
more
to
do
with
paychecks
in
the
face
of
rising
unemployment
renewable
energy
has
become
a
crucial
source
of
good
jobs
particularly
for
laidoff
rust
belt
workers
amid
a
presidential
election
campaign
now
dominated
by
economic
concerns
wind
turbines
and
solar
panels
seem
as
ubiquitous
in
campaign
advertisements
as
the
american
flag
no
one
believes
that
renewable
energy
can
fully
replace
what
has
been
lost
on
the
american
factory
floor
where
people
with
no
college
education
have
traditionally
been
able
to
finance
middleclass
lives
many
at
maytag
earned
20
an
hour
in
addition
to
health
benefits
versendaal
now
earns
about
13
an
hour
still
its
a
beginning
in
a
sector
of
the
economy
that
has
been
marked
by
wrenching
endings
potentially
a
second
chance
for
factory
workers
accustomed
to
layoffs
and
diminished
aspirations
in
west

suffering
because
of
the
downturn
in

are
retooling
to
make

the
green
were
interested
in
is
cash
says
norman
w
johnston
who
started
a
solar
cell
factory
called
solar
fields
in
toledo
in
2003
the
market
is
potentially
enormous
in
a
report
last
year
the
energy
department
concluded
that
the
united
states
could
make
wind
energy
the
source
of
onefifth
of
its
electricity
by
2030
up
from
about
2
percent
today
that
would
require
nearly
500
billion
in
new
construction
and
add
more
than
3
million
jobs
the
report
said
much
of
the
growth
would
be
around
the
great
lakes
the
hardesthit
region
in
a
country
that
has
lost
4
million
manufacturing
jobs
over
the
last
decade
throw
in
solar
energy
along
with
generating
power
from
crops
and
the
continued
embrace
of
renewable
energy
would
create
as
many
as
5
million
jobs
by
2030
asserts
daniel
m
kammen
director
of
the
renewable
and
appropriate
energy
laboratory
at
the
university
of
california
berkeley
and
an
adviser
to
the
presidential
campaign
of
sen
barack
obama
the
unfolding
financial
crisis
seems
likely
to
slow
the
pace
of
development
making
investment
harder
to
secure
but
renewable
energy
has
already
gathered
what
analysts
say
is
unstoppable
momentum
in
texas
the
oil
baron
t
boone
pickens
is
developing
what
would
be
the
largest
wind
farm
in
the
world
most
states
now
require
that
a
significant
percentage
of
electricity
be
generated
from
wind
solar
and
biofuels
effectively
giving
the
market
a
government
mandate
and
many
analysts
expect
the
united
states
to
eventually
embrace
some
form
of
new
regulatory
system
aimed
at
curbing
global
warming
that
would
force
coalfired
electricity
plants
to
pay
for
the
pollution
they
emit
that
could
make
wind
solar
and
other
alternative
fuels
competitive
in
terms
of
the
cost
of
producing
electricity
both
presidential
candidates
have
made
expanding
renewable
energy
a
policy
priority
obama
the
democratic
nominee
has
outlined
plans
to
spend
150
billion
over
the
next
decade
to
spur

2007
the
local

dispatched
a
team
to
the
american
wind
energy
association
show
in
los

weeks
later
a
company
called
tpi
composites
arrived
in
newton
to
have
a
look
based
in
arizona
tpi
makes
wind
turbine
blades
by
layering
strips
of
fiberglass
into
large
molds
requiring
a
long
work
space
the
maytag
plant
was
too
short
so
local
officials
showed
tpi
an
undeveloped
piece
of
land
encircled
by
cornfields
on
the
edge
of
town
where
a
new
plant
could
be
built
although
tpi
was
considering
a
site
in
mexico
with
low
labor
costs
newton
had
a
better
location
rail
lines
and
interstate
80
connect
it
to
the
great
plains
where
the

are
needed
former

newton
won

tpi
promised
to

it
has
already
hired
about
225
and
is
on
track
to
have
a
work
force
of
290
by
midnovember
getting
500
jobs
in
one
swoop
is
like
winning
the
lottery
says
newtons
mayor
chaz
allen
we
dont
have
to
just
roll
over
and
die
on
a
recent
afternoon
workers
inside
the
cavernous
tpi
plant
gaze
excitedly
at
a
crane
lifting
a
blade
from
its
mold
and
carrying
it
toward
a
cleared
area
curved
and
smooth
the
blade
stretches
as
long
as
a
wing
of
the
largest
jets
one
worker
hums
the
theme
from
jaws
as
the
blade
slips
past
larry
crady
a
worker
takes
particular
pleasure
in
seeing
the
finished
product
overhead
a
broad
grin
forming
across
his
goateed
face
he
used
to
run
a
team
that
made
coinoperated
laundry
machines
at
maytag
now
he
supervises
a
team
that
lays
down
fiberglass
strips
between
turbine
moldings
he
runs
his
hand
across
the
surface
of
the
next
blade
for
signs
of
unevenness
i
like
this
job
more
than
i
did
maytag
crady
says
i
feel
im
doing
something
to
improve
our
country
rather
than
just
building
a
washing
machine
ask
him
how
long
he
spent
at
maytag
and
crady
responds
precisely
236
years
which
is
to
say
64
years
short
of
drawing
a
pension
whose
famously
generous
terms
compelled
so
many
to
work
at
the
maytag
plant
thats
what
everyone
in
newton
was
waiting
on
he
says
you
could
get
that
30
and
out
but
he
is
now
optimistic
about
the
decades
ahead
i
feel
solid
he
says
this
is
going
to
be
the
future
this
company
is
going
to
grow
huge
the
human
resources
office
at
tpi
is
overseen
by
terri
rock
who
used
to
have
the
same
position
at
maytags
corporate
headquarters
where
she
worked
for
two
decades
in
her
last
years
there
her
job
was
mostly
spent
ending
other
peoples
jobs
there
was
a
lot
of
heartache
she
says
this
is
a
small
town
and
youd
have
to
let
people
go
and
then
see
them
at
the
grocery
store
with
their
families
it
was
a
real
tough
job
at
the
end
now
rock
starts
fresh
careers
hiring
as
many
as
20
people
a
week
she
enjoys
the
creative
spirit
of
a
startup
were
not
stuck
with
the
mentality
of
this
is
how
weve
done
it
for
the
last
35
years
she
says
maytag
is
gone
in
large
part
because
of
the
calculus
driving
globalization
household
appliances
and
so
many
other
goods
are
now
produced
mostly
where
physical
labor
is
cheaper
in
countries
like
china
and
mexico
but
wind
turbines
and
blades
are
huge
and
heavy
the
tpi
plant
is
in
iowa
largely
because
of
the
costs
of
shipping
such
huge
items
from
far
away
these
are
american
jobs
that
are
hard
to
export
says
crugar
tuttle
general
manager
of
the
tpi
plant
and
these
jobs
are
part
of
a
buildout
that
is
gathering
force
more
than
5
billion
in
venture
capital
poured
into
socalled
clean
energy
technology
industries
last
year
in
north
america
and
europe
according
to
cleantech
a
trade
group
in
north
america
that
represented
nearly
a
fifth
of
all
venture
capital
up
from
less
than
2
percent
in
2000
everybody
involved
in
the
wind
industry
is
in
a
massive
hurry
to
build
out
capacity
tuttle
says
it
will
feed
into
a
whole
local
industry
of
people
making
stuff
driving
trucks
manufacturing
has
been
in
decline
for
decades
this
is
our
greatest
chance
to
turn
it
around
its
the
biggest
ray
of
hope
that
weve
got
those
rays
arent
touching
everyone
though
hundreds
of
former
maytag
workers
remain
without
jobs
or
stuck
in
positions
paying
less
than
half
their
previous
wages
outside
an
old
union
hall
some
former
maytaggers
share
cigarettes
and
commiserate
about
the
strains
of
starting
over
johnson
the
former
local
president
is
jobless
at
45
he
has
slipped
back
into
a
world
of
financial
hardship
that
he
thought
he
had
escaped
his
father
was
a
selfemployed
welder
his
mother
worked
at
an
overalls
factory
i
grew
up
in
southern
iowa
with
nothing
he
says
if
somebody
got
a
new
car
everybody
heard
about
it
when
maytag
shut
down
his
1100aweek
paycheck
became
a
360
unemployment
check
he
and
his
wife
divorced
turning
what
once
was
a
twoincome
household
into
a
noincome
household
he
sold
off
his
truck
his
dining
room
furniture
his
maytag
refrigerator

all
in
an
effort
to
pay
his
mortgage
last
winter
he
surrendered
his
house
to
foreclosure
johnson
has
applied
for
more
than
220
jobs
he
says
from
sales
positions
at
lowes
to
tpi
he
has
yet
to
secure
an
interview
his
unemployment
benefits
ran
out
in
may
he
no
longer
has
health
insurance
he
recently
broke
a
tooth
where
a
filling
had
been
but
he
cant
afford
to
have
it
fixed
when
his
teenage
daughter
who
lives
with
him
complained
of
headaches
he
paid
1500
out
of
pocket
for
an
mri
the
doctor
found
a
cyst
on
her
brain
and
how
is
she
doing
now
johnson
freezes
at
the
question
he
is
a
grown
man
with
silver
hair
a
black
harleydavidson
tshirt
across
a
barrel
chest
and
calloused
hands
that
could
once
bring
a
comfortable
living
he
tries
to
compose
himself
but
tears
burst
im
sorry
he
says
he
signed
up
for
a
state
insurance
program
for
lowincome
families
so
his
daughter
could
go
to
a
neurologist
although
the
united
states
is
well
behind
europe
in
manufacturing
windpower
gear
and
solar
panels
other
american
communities
are
joining
newtons
push
laying
the

for
largescale

you
have

industrial
capacity
says
randy
udall
an

in
carbondale
colo
you
use
wind
to
revitalize
the
rust
belt
you
make

again
you
bring
it
home
we
ought
to
be
planting
wind
turbines
as
if
they
were
trees
in
west
branch
acciona
a
spanish
company
has
converted
the
empty
hydraulic
pump
factory
into
a
plant
that
makes
wind
turbines
when
the
previous
plant
closed
it
wiped
out
130
jobs
acciona
has
hired
120
people
many
of
them
workers
from
the
old

once
made
14
an
hour
at
the
hydraulic
pump
factory
when
he
heard
that
a
wind
turbine
plant
was
coming
in
a
mere
five
miles
from
his
house
he
was
among
the
first
to
apply
for
a
job
now
hes
a
team
leader
earning
nearly
20
an
hour

more
than
hes
ever
made
ordinary
line
workers
make
16
an
hour
and
up
it
seemed
like
manufacturing
was
going
away
he
says
but
i
think
this
is
here
to
stay
acciona
built
its
first
turbine
in
iowa
last
december
and
is
on
track
to
make
200
this
year
next
year
it
plans
to
double
production
for
now
acciona
is
importing
most
of
its
metal
parts
from
europe
but
the
company
is
seeking
american
suppliers
which
could
help
catalyze
increased
metalwork

this
thing
has
critical
mass
in

the
declining
auto

has
prompted
a
retooling
for
more
than
a
century
the

has
been
dominated
by
glassmaking
but
the
problems
of
detroit
automakers
have
softened

toledo

puck
alone
in

by

crosscrease
but
smith
somehow
got
a
glove
up
to
make
the
save
the
lightning
did
not
get
its

shot
until
958
when
auld
stopped
vinny

shot
from
the
bottom
of
a

that
seemed
to
turn
the
tide

forget
all
that
stuff
you
heard
last
week
about
how
florida
hadnt
been
thinking
about
georgia
until
the
week
leading
up
to
the
game
and
how
last
years
loss
and
the
end
zone
celebration
wasnt
a
factor
in
saturdays
game
you
had
better
believe
it
was
a
factor
so
much
so
the
gators
summer
conditioning
workouts
with
trainer
mickey
marotti
included
some
georgia
stats
188
the
number
of
rushing
yards
bulldogs
rb
knownshon
moreno
gained
against
the
gators
last
season
they
came
in
evenly
divided
reps
on
weights
pushups
crunches
and
situps
it
was
all
the
numbers
from
the
stuff
we
got
embarrassed
by
uf
quarterback
tim
tebow
said
we
worked
on
that
and
i
think
its
been
a
lot
on
our
minds
all
year
the
memory
motivated
the
gators
they
now
admit
was
it
motivation
for
the
summer
yeah
it
was
meyer
said
it
was
it
was
the
only
rival
we
lost
to
a
year
ago
and
losing
doesnt
set
well
with
our
team
and
thats
a
good
thing
timeout
if
youre
wondering
why
florida
called
two
timeouts
in
the
final
44
seconds
with
a
4910
lead
it
all
depends
on
whom
you
asked
meyer
said
he
was
trying
to
get
more
work
for
rb
emmanuel
moody
who
just
returned
from
an
ankle
injury
i
thought
he
deserved
that
chance
meyer
said
we
were
just
trying
to
win
a
game
but
tebow
and
junior
wr
percy
harvin
seemed
to
think
it
was
an
opportunity
to
allow
the
players
and
florida
fans
a
few
more
moments
to
savor
the
victory
we
looked
at
the
sideline
and
saw
that
all
their
georgia
fans
had
gone
and
we
saw
our
fans
still
there
said
harvin
who
scored
a
touchdown
in
his
10th
straight
game
we
just
wanted
to
rub
it
in
a
little
bit
not
too
much
but
it
was
great
for
us
murphys
reward
st
petersburg
native
louis
murphy
got
the
opportunity
to
walk
off
the
field
as
a
winner
in
his
last
game
against
georgia
murphy
a
wide
receiver
had
one
of
the
games
biggest
plays
a
44yard
touchdown
reception
from
tebow
we
were
ready
more
than
ever
said
murphy
a
former
lakewood
high
standout
we
came
out
and
hit
on
all
cylinders
and
we
played
a
great
game
i
didnt
see
this
lopsided
score
but
i
knew
we
had
the
potential
harvin
said
he
was
especially
happy
for
murphy
because
of
all
he
has
been
through
in
the
past
year
his
mother
filomena
died
in
february
this
was
the
game
that
she
started
to
get
sick
last
season
and
i
think
it
meant
more
to
him
harvin
said
it
meant
a
lot
to
all
of
us
our
staff
but
i
know
it
meant
a
lot
to
him
tebow
slightly
injured
tebow
stood
at
a
podium
about
30
minutes
after
the
gators
victory
wearing
a
protective
boot
on
his
left
foot
tebow
said
he
sprained
his
left
ankle
on
the
play
just
before
his
touchdown
pass
to
murphy
with
533
remaining
in
the
third
quarter
the
ankle
didnt
stop
tebow
from
doing
a
victory
lap
around
jacksonville
municipal
stadium
to
slap
hands
with
florida
fans
and
he
said
it
wont
stop
him
from
playing
in
next
weeks
vanderbilt
game
i
just
sprained
it
a
little
bit
but
its
fine
tebow
said
this
boot
is
just
to
keep
pressure
off
of
it
jacksonville
when
it
was
all
over
when
the
final
seconds
had
ticked
off
the
clock
and
no
5
florida
was
celebrating
its
4910
victory
over
no
8
georgia
the
truth
finally
came
through
yes
the
gators
were
bothered
all
year
long
nearly
every
day
about
their
bitter
loss
to
georgia
last
season
and
no
it
wasnt
just
about
georgias
infamous
end
zone
celebration
it
was
just
as
much
about
how
poorly
its
defense
had
played
how
badly
florida
looked
overall
against
the
bulldogs
so
all
week
long
floridas
sole
mission
was
to
play
the
best
defense
it
had
all
season
more
important
to
stop
georgia
star
running
back
knowshon
moreno
and
not
allow
the
bulldogs
to
run
all
over
the
gators
as
they
had
last
season
they
executed
that
plan
to
perfection
holding
its
archrival
without
a
touchdown
until
the
final
309
florida
redeemed
itself
in
front
of
84649
at
jacksonville
municipal
stadium
the
39point
margin
of
victory
was
the
secondlargest
for
florida
in
the
86year
series
with
a
victory
over
vanderbilt
next
week
florida
can
clinch
the
sec
east
title
defensive
coordinator
charlie
strong
and
his
staff
did
a
great
job
uf
coach
urban
meyer
said
as
of
tuesday
night
they
were
still
preparing
and
adjusting
their
game
plan
i
thought
he
called
a
brilliant
game
and
the
players
executed
well
with
great
defense
you
can
win
a
bunch
of
ballgames
and
i
thought
we
played
great
defense
tonight
florida
71
51
sec
gave
up
398
total
yards
but
held
georgia

42
to
106
rushing
yards
moreno
the
secs
secondleading
rusher
was
held
to
65
yards
on
17
carries
the
key
was
to
stop
the
run
strong
said
we
knew
that
georgia
quarterback
matthew
stafford
could
throw
the
ball
and
they
have
very
good
receivers
but
our
whole
key
was
to
stop
the
run
the
way
moreno
ran
against
us
last
year
we
could
not
let
that
happen

the
gators
intercepted
stafford
18of33
for
265
yards
three
times
including
an
88yard
return
by
joe
haden
and
a
64yarder
by
ahmad
black
both
led
to
florida
touchdowns
dustin
doe
also
had
an
interception
and
terron
sanders
20yard
return
after
recovering
a
fumble
also
led
to
a
florida
touchdown
theres
nothing
soft
about
our
defense
sanders
said
its
a
complete
turnaround
from
last
season

while
the
defense
set
things
up
the
offense
delivered
florida
quarterback
tim
tebow
was
10of13
for
154
yards
and
two
touchdowns
a
44yard
pass
to
senior
louis
murphy
and
a
25yarder
to
junior
percy
harvin
this
was
a
game
we
felt
would
make
our
season
and
we
got
it
said
harvin
who
had
three
receptions
for
52
yards
and
four
carries
for
37
yards
tebow
also
rushed
for
three
touchdowns
registering
193
total
offensive
yards
we
were
very
emotional
but
we
were
a
lot
more
than
emotional
because
emotion
just
lasts
for
10
or
15
minutes
we
were
playing
with
passion
too
we
were
very
passionate
and
that
lasts
a
lot
more
than
emotion
does
the
gators
piled
up
373
yards
against
a
defense
that
entered
the
game
ranked
21st
in
the
nation
and
had
held
opponents
to
an
average
of
203
points
a
game

florida
did
a
good
job
today
no
doubt
georgia
coach
mark
richt
said

we
cant
let
this
loss
hurt
us
the
next
time
we
play
the
bottom
line
is
we
played
and
got
whipped

with
so
much
riding
on
this
game
and
the
memories
of
last
season
meyer
admitted
the
victory
meant
a
great
deal
to
him
and
the
gators
what
does
it
mean
he
asked
it
means
were
first
place
in
the
sec
east
all
by
ourselves
its
a
rivalry
game
and
weve
done
fairly
well
against
our
rivals
it
means
a
lot
because
its
a
top
10
team
this
is
a
game
we
had
to
have
antonya
english
can
be
reached
at
englishsptimescom
even
through
the
tough
years
joe
maddon
seemed
to
find
a
way
to
put
a
positive
spin
on
things
so
it
was
no
surprise
that
he
didnt
let
any
disappointment
over
a
fourgamestoone
loss
to
the
phillies
in
the
fall
classic
stop
him
from
reflecting
on
the
rays
worsttotheworld
series
ride
nor
did
it
dampen
his
excitement
over
the
clubs
future
in
an
endoftheseason
interview
unlike
any
he
has
had
as
rays
manager
favorite
moment
from
the
season
the
whole
thing
my
favorite
moment
is
to
see
the
faces
whether
its
our
players
the
guys
who
work
in
our
clubhouse
the
training
staff
the
guys
upstairs
the
front
office
people
who
have
been
here
for
so
many
years
to
see
the
look
on
their
faces
right
now
and
how
happy
they
are
the
fact
that
all
the
negativity
has
been
laid
to
rest
we
have
a
bright
future
ahead
of
us
ive
been
looking
at
faces
a
lot
for
example
the
other
day
we
ended
up
in
wilmington
del
in
the
middle
of
the
night
after
a
tie
ballgame
it
was
freezing
outside
and
were
all
outside
getting
our
luggage
at
whatever
time
it
was
and
a
significant
part
of
the
organization
was
there
to
me
that
was
a
great
moment
that
might
be
the
one
snapshot
ill
take
with
me
things
that
will
be
taken
from
the
world
series
into
next
season
the
biggest
part
is
the
little
things
you
can
break
down
those
games
as
an
example
jayson
werths
twostrike
hitting
again
same
with
carlos
ruiz
and
pedro
feliz
from
our
perspective
the
safety
squeeze
that
was
done
by
jason
bartlett
the
wonderful
defensive
plays
the
little
things
i
want
that
to
be
the
focal
point
next
season
were
going
to
be
the
target
thats
beautiful
for
us
to
be
able
to
withstand
the
challenge
i
dont
want
us
to
play
the
game
any
better
in
a
sense
of
hit
more
home
runs
i
want
us
to
play
the
game
better
fundamentally
whats
striking
about
the
players
in
the
clubhouse
the
unity
the
closeness
the
support
among
each
other
again
we
went
from
a
very
low
trust
organization
to
a
very
high
trust
organization
built
on
relationships
and
all
the
right
internal
workings
are
in
place
to
make
this
successful
for
many
years
to
come
the
national
debate
surrounding
your
handling
of
the
bullpen
in
game
5
it
is
amusing
thats
exactly
how
we
had
it
laid
out
it
just
didnt
work
if
they
get
a
couple
knocks
its
always
going
to
make
it
look
wrong
i
have
had
so
much
confidence
in
all
these
pitchers
all
year
and
thats
what
people
have
to
understand
we
wouldnt
be
sitting
here
right
now
if
it
wasnt
for
that
group
of
people
right
there
truly
the
bullpen
probably
is
as
important
as
any
aspect
of
our
game
this
year
and
those
guys
have
had
a
great
year
and
to
say
that
i
should
have
done
something
differently
would
admit
that
i
did
not
have
confidence
in
those
people
which
to
me
is
wrong
how
different
everything
is
right
now
it
is
different
its
entirely
different
the
whole
vibe
is
different
weve
arrived
as
an
organization
and
as
a
force
within
majorleague
baseball
and
our
guys
now
have
a
national
face
and
i
like
that
one
of
the
most
gratifying
things
that
have
occurred
throughout
this
postseason
is
how
well
our
players
represented
us
and
im
really
proud
of
that
thoughts
on
the
growing
excitement
around
the
area
about
the
rays
its
very
exciting
i
was
just
driving
over
the
gandy
bridge
thursday
and
the
guy
on
the
other
side
just
setting
up
shop
on
the
grass
with
a
table
with
some
rays
tshirts
he
had
it
advertised
im
thinking
to
myself
oh
my
god
how
has
that
happened
youre
talking
about
arriving
ive
often
talked
about
going
to
europe
and
i
want
to
see
some
rays
gear
on
just
anybody
walking
down
the
street
somehow
and
i
will
take
a
photograph
the
fact
people
know
who
we
were
and
they
know
how
we
play
i
think
a
lot
of
people
embraced
a
lot
of
what
were
about
tampa
coach
barry
melrose
made
good
on
a
vow
to
reduce
the
minutes
played
by
stars
marty
st
louis
and
vinny
lecavalier
who
were
first
and
fourth
in
the
league
among
forwards
last
season
with
averages
of
2417
and
2257
respectively
st
louis
averaged
2122
entering
saturday
lecavalier
1922
im
sure
they
dont
like
it
melrose
said
lecavalier
has
said
he
would
prefer
playing
20
to
21
minutes
st
louis
too
said
he
wouldnt
mind
a
few
more
im
not
complaining
he
said
but
there
are
games
when
you
feel
you
want
to
be
out
there
more
especially
when
you
feel
great
are
25
minutes
too
much
a
little
bit
over
a
long
period
of
time
absolutely
but
i
think
it
all
depends
on
where
we
are
in
the
game
the
main
cut
for
lecavalier
has
been
in
penaltykill
time
of
which
he
had
just
37
seconds
in
his
previous
seven
games
some
nights
theyll
play
23
24
minutes
if
were
down
a
goal
melrose
said
but
id
like
to
keep
them
in
the
early
20s
i
think
that
will
make
us
better
in
march
and
april
craig
returns
ryan
craig
played
his
first
game
since
nov
10
on
right
wing
with
c
chris
gratton
and
gary
roberts
craig
26
played
seven
games
last
season
because
of
back
and
knee
problems
he
was
a
healthy
scratch
for
two
games
this
season
before
going
on
injured
reserve
with
a
strained
groin
im
very
excited
craig
said
before
the
game
its
been
a
long
time
this
is
what
i
want
to
do
and
what
i
love
to
do

ottawas

he
feels
more

in

offense
than
he
did
with

he
said

i
have
a

of
respect
for

and
the

and
the

there
i
was

to
leave

said
hartsburg
now
the
senators
coach
hes
going
to
be
a
top

in
this

it
takes
all
players
some
time
to
find
their

it

did
anything
wrong
saturday
unless
you
want
to
count
the
embarrassed
looks
on
the
faces
of
the
georgia
bulldogs
when
they
might
as
well
have
had
their
pants
pulled
down
around
their
knees
in
the
final
minute
of
floridas
4910
victory
for
no
discernible
reason
other
than
revenge
the
gators
called
consecutive
timeouts
with
44
and
30
seconds
remaining
in
a
runaway
game
there
was
no
attempt
to
run
the
score
up
no
angry
gestures
on

sideline
just
an
implied
middle

salute
from

were

enjoying
the

florida
quarterback

said
we
didnt
do
anything
wrong
we
were
just
playing
the
game
consider
it
a
crime
of
passion
for
more
than
a
year
the
gators
have
lived
with
the
memory
of
georgias
4230
victory
that
essentially
buried
floridas
chances
for
a
southeastern
conference
title
in
2007
more
than
that
they
lived
with
the
humiliation
of
the
dawgs
doing
a
teamwide
end

dance
after
an
early
touchdown
strength
and
conditioning
coach
mickey
marotti
had
a
photo
of

mounted

almost
from
the
moment
it
happened
more
photos
showed
up
on
the
lockers
of
florida
players
last
week
throughout
offseason
workouts
the
gators
were
reminded
of
how
soft
they
played
against
georgia
when
marotti
pushed
them
to
do
repeated
sets
of
pushups
situps
and
crunches
depending
on
the

had

georgia
georgia
georgia
the
subjects
of
dancing
and
payback
were
offlimits
around
gainesville
last
week
meyer
would
not
let
his
players
talk
about
it
and
he
avoided
the
subject
himself
the
best
gauge
of
the
florida
coachs
feelings
was
a
passage
in
a
recent
biography
when
he
suggested
florida
would
find
a
way
to
handle
the
slight
so
maybe
the
intent
of
tebows
25yard
touchdown
pass
with
1130
remaining
could
be
debated
and
even
the
7yard
touchdown
pass
by
backup
quarterback
john
brantley
in
the
final
eight
minutes
is
open
to
interpretation
but
really
there
is
no
mistaking
the
purpose
behind
the
timeouts
unless
you
want
to
argue
which
timeout
was
kissmybutt
and
which
was
stickitinyourear
for
the
record
meyer
said
the
timeouts
were
simply
a
way
to
get
extra
carries
for
running
back
emmanuel
moody
later
however
meyer
touched
on
the
importance
of
respecting
the
game
maybe
that
was
a
jab
at
georgias
behavior
last
season
or
maybe
it
was
an
explanation
for
his
subtle
retaliation
saturday
perhaps
it
was
a
little
bit
of
both
no
matter
how
he
wanted
to
spin
it
the
message
was
received
meyer
and
georgia
coach
mark
richt
did
a
driveby
handshake
at
midfield
when
the
game
was
finally
completed
meanwhile
when
the
final
timeouts
were
called
the
bleachers
at
jacksonville
municipal
stadium
told
the
story
as
accurately
as
the
scoreboard
the
georgia
side
of
the
stadium
was
nearly
empty
and
the
florida
side
was
getting
revved
up
for
the
postgame

from
its
own
2yard
line
tailback
chris

was
tackled
in
the
end

took

drove
96

in

to
score
on
tailback
baron
butchs
3yard
run
to
go
ahead
120
to
end
the
first
quarter
texas
stalled
again
on
its
third
possession
but
pushed
texas
tech
back
to
its
own
17yard
line
with
a
67yard
punt
that
hardly
slowed
the
red
raiders
facing
thirdand14
from
texas
32yard
line
harrell
held
the
ball
for
almost
10
seconds
and
retreated
to
near

before
completing
a
14yard
pass
to
crossing
wide

lyle
leong
near
the
right
sideline
for
a
first
down
on

he
threw

fans
ran
on
to
the
field
three
times
prematurely
before
the

ended
after
texas
failed
kickoff
return
a
sign
said
our
time
our
house
texas
tech
and
leach
have
arrived
quarterback
jeff
garcia
has
a
solution
for
his
teams
inability
to
score
touchdowns
when
it
gets
into
the
red
zone
that
area
of
the
field
between
the
opponents
20yard
line
and
the
goal
line
that
has
been
a
dead
zone
for
the
bucs
this
season
take
a
chance
throw
some
caution
and
maybe
a
football
to
the
wind
give
the
guys
with
flypaper
hands
a
chance
to
snag
a
pass
from
a
defender
we
cant
go
into
every
single
play
like
theres
going
to
be
a
perfect
outlet
that
theres
going
to
be
a
person
wide
open
and
im
going
to
hit
that
player
and
hes
going
to
be
able
to
run
and
make
a
first
down
garcia
said
sometimes
we
just
need
to
be
playmakers
and
we
need
to
allow
our
playmakers
which
are
our
receivers
our
tight
ends
to
sometimes
go
up
and
outfight
a
defender
for
a
football
and
we
need
to
trust
in
that
i
think
we
get
caught
up
into
being
such
a
rhythmtype
team
looking
for
the
best
outlet
looking
for
the
open
receiver
that
we
lose
sight
of
just
taking
shots
at
times
and
just
taking
chances
its
mystifying
really
the
bucs
offense
is
13th
in
the
nfl
averaging
more
than
341
yards
per
game
but
in
red
zone
scoring
tampa
bay
is
29th
in
the
league
with
only
11
touchdowns
in
31
trips
a
percentage
of
355
no
matter
how
easily
the
bucs
breeze
up
and
down
the
field
their
trek
inside
the
dead
zone
is
like
traversing
a
desert
on
a
broken
ankle
over
shards
of
glass
take
last
weeks
139
loss
at
dallas
tampa
bay
settled
for
three
field
goals
and
the
game
ended
when
the
bucs
failed
to
convert
on
fourth
and
5
at
the
cowboys
18
garcia
didnt
throw
one
pass
to
the
end
zone
sometimes
under
duress
he
checked
the
ball
down
to
tight
end
jerramy
stevens
or
wideout
ike
hilliard
on
shallow
crossing
routes
despite
having
three
timeouts
when
the
drive
started
the
bucs
only
attempted
passes
on
their
final
11
plays
on
the
last
play
receiver
joey
galloway
put
a
double
move
on
cowboys
cornerback
alan
ball
who
slipped
leaving
galloway
alone
in
the
end
zone
but
garcia
never
saw
him
throwing
incomplete
to
stevens
unfortunately
jeff
didnt
have
a
chance
to
see
it
galloway
said
thats
one
of
those
things
where
half
the
play
was
really
good
and
we
didnt
finish
it
so
it
doesnt
really
matter
ive
never
been
a
guy
that
scored
much
inside
the
red
zone
ive
been
a
guy
that
scored
outside
the
red
zone
so
of
course
with
that
in
mind
id
like
to
let
coach
know
lets
go
from
outside
the
red
zone
the
bucs
red
zone
production
has
been
even
worse
during
their
three
losses
all
on
the
road
tampa
bay
has
scored
two
touchdowns
in
nine
trips
or
22
percent
of
the
time
one
problem
has
been
the
bucs
inability
or
unwillingness
to
run
in
the
red
zone
when
the
field
gets
shorter
its
much
easier
for
defenses
to
stack
the
line
of
scrimmage
thats
every
red
zone
tape
we
look
at
coach
jon
gruden
said
i
think
our
firstdown
carries
last
week
we
lost
yards
twice
and
we
got
stopped
on
third
down
on
one
and
we
do
have
a
pretty
good
quarterback
here
and
were
going
to
try
to
accentuate
anything
weve
got
to
do
to
win
a
football
game
if
weve
got
to
throw
it
every
snap
we
will
injuries
have
been
a
factor
the
bucs
lost
fullback
byron
storer
for
the
season
when
he
tore
his
right
acl
against
the
panthers
starter
bj
askew
hasnt
played
since
tearing
his
hamstring
in
week
3
at
chicago
last
week
warrick
dunn
was
limited
because
of
a
pinched
nerve
in
his
back
we
had
fresh
good
players
and
we
had
a
neat
little
rotation
going
gruden
said
of
the
rushing
attack
earlier
this
season
obviously
with
warricks
injury
lingering
and
two
fullbacks
out
its
something
weve
got
to
all
clean
up
weve
got
to
fight
through
this
weve
got
to
do
some
things
better
and
that
we
will
garcia
says
the
bucs
have
good
red
zone
practices
each
friday
but
so
far
they
havent
been
able
to
carry
over
into
games
i
dont
know
why
its
not
carrying
over
garcia
said
you
look
at
the
situations
we
had
this
past
game
we
unfortunately
on
third
and
1
dont
convert
a
third
down
we
see
a
defense
we
didnt
prepare
for
should
that
matter
it
shouldnt
matter
we
should
find
a
way
we
didnt
make
it
happen
the
next
time
were
down
in
the
red
zone
i
get
the
penalty
for
crossing
the
line
of
scrimmage
we
get
into
a
thirdandlong
situation
we
become
our
own
worst
enemy
when
we
get
down
to
the
red
zone
gruden
spent
the
week
admitting
his
playcalling
in
red
zone
situations
could
have
been
better
but
garcia
bears
a
little
of
the
blame
too
sometimes
he
says
a
quarterback
has
to
squeeze
a
throw
and
hope
for
the
best
i
didnt
do
a
very
good
job
and
we
didnt
play
well
enough
as
a
team
gruden
said
weve
all
got
to
throw
our
hat
in
there
and
assume
some
responsibility
but
ive
got
a
lot
of
confidence
in
jeff
hopefully
we
can
all
get
clicking
again
garcia
said
his
training
in
the
west
coast
offense
taught
him
to
think
touchdown
then
check
down
whenever
his
team
gets
in
the
red
zone
coaches
such
as
the
late
bill
walsh
and
the
seahawks
mike
holmgren
have
been
notorious
for
trying
to
strike
as
soon
as
they
reach
the
opponents
20yard
line
i
think
somehow
some
way
we
need
to
find
a
way
to
be
back
in
that
sort
of
mode
garcia
said
i
think
with
how
weve
played
recently
in
the
red
zone
weve
missed
out
on
a
lot
of
great
opportunities
and
when
youre
in
those
last
two
minutes
it
is
important
to
take
some
shots
to
the
end
zone

two
weeks
ago
after
his
a
concert
in
houston
softrock
legend
neil
diamond
paid
an
incognito
visit
to
oak
island
a
small
unincorporated
hamlet
in
trinity
bay
and
was
shocked
by
the
devastation
after
hurricane
ike
decimated
the
area
in
september
left
in
the
aftermath
heaping
rotting
piles
of
debris
hundreds
of
homes
washed
away
and
displaced
residents
some
still
sleeping
in
tents
and
cars
struggling
to
rebuild
ever
since
he
has
given
something
of
a
stump
speech
about
the
former
fishing
village
at
each
of
his
concerts
and
operating
almost
completely
under
the
radar
he
has
promised
to
donate
100
percent
of
the
gross
merchandise
sales
at
20
concerts
to
assist
in
the
rebuilding
of
the
small
community
which
sits
just
a
few
miles
south
of
anahuac
in
chambers
county
if
sales
continue
proceeds
could
exceed
4
million
by
years
end
these
people
are
in
big
trouble
and
i
want
to
help
diamond
said
it
may
only
be
a
drop
in
the
bucket
but
im
going
to
ask
my
audiences
in
every
city
that
i
play
to
help
so
far
theyve
come
through
to
the
tune
of
more
than
700000
i
intend
to
keep
asking
until
the
end
of
this
tour
the
money
will
be
administered
by
the
gulf
coast
ike
relief
fund
the
charity
set
up
by
mayor
bill
white
who
piqued
the
singers
interest
in
oak
island
chambers
county
was
among
the
areas
hardest
hit
by
ike
in
oak
island
more
than
half
the
islands
homes
are
gone
or
uninhabitable
as
we
drove
down
there
i
tried
to
show
him
the
height
of
the
storms
line
in
the
trees
and
you
could
still
see
the
debris
up
there
that
was
carried
by
the
water
said
anahuac
mayor
guy
jackson
who
took
diamond
to
the
community
and
then
we
started
getting
to
the
homes
the
level
of
destruction
just
gets
worse
and
worse
and
worse
as
you
get
closer
to
waters
edge
diamond
who
performs
wildly
popular
renditions
of
america
and
sweet
caroline
also
couldnt
help
but
notice
that
people
were
living
in
tents
and
cars
next
to
their
destroyed
property
for
a
lot
of
people
there
all
they
got
left
is
a
few
belongings
and
they
dont
want
to
leave
them
said
chambers
county
judge
jimmy
silvia
officials
with
the
federal
emergency
management
agency
offered
to
help
with
rentals
in
baytown
but
that
was
too
far
away
from
many
residents
jobs
and
as
of
late
last
week
fema
had
yet
to
allow
anyone
to
move
in
to
the
trailers
that
were
recently
brought
in
silvia
said
so
in
effect
people
were
still
sleeping
in
tents
and
cars
while
trailers
sat
unused
nearby
he
said
although
diamond
recently
told
concertgoers
in
dallas
and
tulsa
to
help
get
people
out
of
tents
what
most
got
his
attention
during
his
visit
to
oak
island
was
the
communitys
resolve
at
a
meeting
he
attended
outside
a
small
church
people
committed
to
fix
their
homes
on
their
own
as
best
they
could
thats
what
prompted
him
to
continue
giving
as
much
as
he
could
and
to
tell
all
his
fans
about
oak
island
texas
would
be
surprised
at
the
cities
that
have
come
through
for
them
diamond
said
my
hope
is
to
put
as
many
people
as
we
can
back
in
homes
as
quickly
as
possible
he
preyed
upon
older
women
some
in
their
70s
one
as
old
as
99
police
said
he
raped
them
and
sometimes
authorities
said
he
beat
them
to
death
during
the
mid1980s
police
had
a
suspect
for
these
acts
henry
lee
bethune
but
no
hard
evidence
linking
him
to
a
crime
scene
then
a
sergeant
in
the
houston
police
departments
homicide
division
jim
yarbrough
read
a
magazine
article
on
the
first
use
of
dna
to
solve
a
crime
mystery
in
england
yarbrough
called
the
pioneering
scientist
an
english
geneticist
named
alec
jeffreys
setting
off
a
chain
of
events
that
would
lead
to
the
conviction
of
bethune

one
of
the
first
texas
criminals
convicted
with
dna
evidence

on
charges
of
raping
a
74yearold
woman
this
friday
marks
the
20th
anniversary
of
that
conviction

the
first
based
on
dna
in
a
harris
county
proceeding
its
hard
to
believe
now
but
at
that
time
there
were
no
lawenforcement
dna
labs
in
the
united
states
recalled
rusty
hardin
who
prosecuted
the
bethune
case
when
he
was
assistant
district
attorney
essentially
dna
was
not
being
used
forensically
yet
the
scientific
witness
in
the
trial
dr
c
thomas
caskey
went
on
to
invent
the
dna
testing
standard
now
used
worldwide
by
crime
labs
at
the
time
of
the
trial
the
goal
was
simply
to
end
a
string
of
crimes
in
which
elderly
women
were
beaten
and
raped
a
victim
testified
that
bethune
who
was
suspected
in
at
least
14
rapes
as
well
as
two
murders
had
told
her
he
preferred
old
women
because
young
women
all
have
diseases
hardin
said
he
had
confidence
in
the
testimony
of
the
victim
but
its
often
hard
he
said
to
get
a
jury
to
convict
on
the
basis
of
such
evidence
alone
the
jury
foreman
stan
curry
said
at
the
time
the
dna
just
cinched
it
back
then
using
dna
evidence
seemed
like
a
stretch
yarbrough
said
he
learned
from
his
call
to
jeffreys
the
english
geneticist
that
there
were
only
two
commercial
dna
laboratories
in
the
us
in
1986
and
no
government
labs
yarbrough
collected
samples
from
bethune
and
sent
those
along
with
crime
scene
material
to
the
two
labs
both
returned
hits
there
was
just
a
one
in
700
million
chance
that
someone
other
than
henry
lee
bethune
had
left
a
semen
sample
on
the
mattress
of
the
74yearold
houston
woman
hardin
said
the
two
labs
offered
experts
to
testify
at
trial
but
told
him
there
was
no
better
witness
than
a
dna
expert
in
houston
i
go
well
who
is
that

hardin
recalled
it
was
tom
caskey
i
had
never
met
him
caskey
was
director
of
the
molecular
genetics
program
at
baylor
college
of
medicine
and
was
interested
in
getting
into
forensic
dna
at
the
trial
he
grew
tired
of
a
litany
of
dna
questions
that
didnt
seem
to
have
much
to
do
with
the
case
i
dont
think
they
understood
the
questions
they
were
asking
and
im
certain
they
didnt
understand
the
answers
caskey
said
of
the
defense
attorneys
so
at
one
point
i
responded
im
sorry
you
are
just
going
to
have
to
ask
better
questions
the
judge
didnt
like
that
very
much
hardin
added
ahh
but
the
jury
did
bethune
who
later
was
convicted
of
raping
another
74yearold
woman
remains
incarcerated
and
has
been
denied
parole
caskeys
primary
scientific
interest
at
the
time
involved
the
identification
of
genes
linked
to
human
disease
but
during
the
course
of
his
research
he
identified
short
segments
of
dna

called
short
tandem
repeats
or
strs

that
vary
widely
from
person
to
person
his
lab
developed
an
str
identification
technique
that
soon
became
the
gold
standard
for
criminal
cases
the
method
underlies
the
us
combined
dna
index
system
or
codis
which
contains
dna
information
on
more
than
6
million
offenders
the
system
also
forms
the
basis
of
interpols
criminal
database
and
that
of
most
governments
after
he
developed
the
system
caskey
testified
at
the
first
dna
cases
held
in
various
federal
districts
he
was
often
asked
by
defense
attorneys
whether
he
stood
to
benefit
from
the
new
technology
i
got
mad
about
it
so
i
told
my
dean
i
was
going
to
give
him
all
of
my
patents
caskey
said
today
the
patents
provide
baylor
with
enough
annual
revenue
to
fund
the
education
of
eight
students
working
to
obtain
medical
or
doctorate
degrees
dont
ever
say
crime
doesnt
pay
crime
does
pay
quipped
caskey
who
now
directs
the
brown
foundation
institute
of
molecular
medicine
for
the
prevention
of
human
diseases
a
part
of
the
university
of
texas
health
science
center
at
houston
both
caskey
and
hardin
say
incidents
such
as
the
oj
simpson
trial
and
the
failings
of
houstons
crime
lab
have
tarnished
dna
science
assuming
everythings
done
properly
the
science
is
not
going
to
lie
said
hardin
now
a
prominent
defense
attorney
after
two
decades
the
science
is
more
promising
than
ever
said
david
gangitano
an
assistant
professor
at
sam
houston
state
university
and
a
forensic
dna
expert
new
techniques
are
making
it
possible
to
identify
criminals
with
much
smaller
samples
of
dna
and
as
the
price
to
sequence
dna
falls
its
possible
that
forensic
scientists
will
soon
be
able
to
match
the
pollen
on
a
suspects
clothing
with
specific
trees
or
use
the
dna
of
a
drug
plant
to
determine
its
precise
point
of
origin
moreover
dna
from
a
crime
scene
may
soon
allow
police
to
determine
a
perpetrators
eye
color
hair
color
race
or
other
traits
that
might
aid
them
in
the
apprehension
of
a
suspect
state
of
the
league
at
midseason
were
halfway
through
the
nfl
season
so
time
for
our
midseason
report
most
surprising
team
it
seems
bizarre
to
consider
a
team
that
is
34
as
a
surprise
but
we
were
tempted
to
put
miami
in
this
slot
the
dolphins
won
one
game
last
season
and
this
season
already
have
victories
over
new
england
and
san
diego
with
parity
in
the
nfl
its
surprising
when
any
team
is
undefeated
at
the
end
of
october
but
who
would
have
thought
the
titans
would
lose
qb
vince
young
almost
from
the
start
and
be
70
at
this
point
with
journeyman
kerry
collins
at
quarterback
so
we
go
with
the
titans
coach
of
the
year
plenty
of
good
candidates
out
there
such
as
washingtons
jim
zorn
buffalos
dick
jauron
miamis
tony
sparano
and
yes
even
bill
belichick
who
has
the
patriots
at
52
without
qb
tom
brady
but
were
starting
to
think
tennessees
jeff
fisher
just
might
be
the
best
coach
in
all
of
football
do
you
realize
he
is
in
his
15th
season
with
the
titans
in
fact
he
goes
back
to
the
houston
days
and
he
is
12299
for
his
career
including
an
improbable
70
this
season
other
surprising
teams
the
redskins
are
62
mostly
because
qb
jason
campbell
below
has
not
thrown
an
interception
this
season
the
bills
52
got
off
to
their
best
start
since
1992
and
though
they
have
faded
the
broncos
are
still
43
and
lead
the
afc
west
most
disappointing
team
we
knew
the
colts
were
starting
to
slip
a
little
but
not
only
are
they
34
they
easily
could
be
16
had
it
not
been
for
a
couple
of
bigtime
fourthquarter
comebacks
they
were
blown
out
last
week
by
the
titans
and
they
likely
will
not
win
the
afc
south
for
the
first
time
since
2002
other
disappointing
teams
some
thought
jacksonville
was
a
super
bowl
contender
but
the
jaguars
sit
right
with
the
colts
at
34
cleveland
and
minnesota
were
supposed
to
be
better
than
34
and
although
philadelphia
43
and
dallas
53
have
winning
records
both
teams
have
been
up
and
down
most
surprising
player
quite
frankly
we
had
forgotten
kerry
collins
above
even
played
in
the
league
we
were
reminded
when
titans
qb
vince
young
went
down
and
wigged
out
after
one
game
collins
isnt
exactly
winning
games
he
has
only
three
touchdown
passes
but
he
isnt
losing
games
either
he
has
only
three
interceptions
most
disappointing
player
he
hasnt
been
a
bust
but
qb
brett
favre
above
hasnt
turned
the
jets
into
super
bowl
contenders
he
is
having
an
okay
season
15
touchdowns
11
interceptions
and
thus
the
jets
are
having
an
okay
season
at
43
then
comes
word
that
he
might
have
shared
old
packers
secrets
with
the
lions
is
anyone
truly
happy
this
guy
unretired
offensive
mvp
actually
were
going
to
go
with
comvps
from
the
same
team
washington
qb
jason
campbell
and
rb
clinton
portis
above
are
playing
the
kind
of
football
that
not
only
has
helped
the
redskins
build
a
62
record
but
its
the
kind
that
wins
in
the
playoffs
campbell
has
been
errorfree
while
compiling
the
fifthbest
quarterback
rating
in
the
nfl
meanwhile
portis
averages
118
yards
a
game
and
barring
injury
will
win
the
rushing
title
easily
defensive
mvp
because
we
went
with
comvps
on
offense
we
will
do
the
same
on
defense
we
have
11
comvps
the
entire
titans
defense
keith
bulluck
above
and
the
titans
are
allowing
fewer
than
two
touchdowns
a
game
124
points
only
one
team
has
scored
more
than
17
in
a
game
against
tennessee
and
that
was
last
week
when
the
colts
scored
a
late
meaningless
touchdown
to
finish
with
21
rookie
of
the
year
not
only
has
qb
matt
ryan
above
made
falcons
fans
forget
about
the
past
and
michael
vick
but
he
has
them
thinking
about
the
future
and
the
playoffs
maybe
the
postseason
is
a
stretch
but
ryan
is
playing
better
than
rookies
are
supposed
to
play
at
that
position
he
has
more
touchdown
passes
seven
than
interceptions
five
and
this
is
the
big
number
the
falcons
are
43
five
biggest

the

2
for

3
can

4
can

they
learned
that
27
army
officers
and
enlisted
men
had
been
fired
over
a
scandal
in
which
11
young
men
from
a
bogota
slum
were
lured
into
the
countryside
then
executed
and
presented
by
the
military
as
enemy
combatants
the
killings
known
as
false
positives
were
apparently
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
colombian
investigators
are
looking
into
more
than
700
cases
from
around
the
country
in
which
young
men
were
allegedly
executed
then
registered
by
army
officers

who
were
looking
to
impress
their
superiors

as
guerrillas
or
paramilitaries
killed
in
action
if
we
end
up
proving
that
illegal
executions
are
a
systematic
and
generalized
practice
then
it
would
constitute
a
crime
against

attorney

mario
iguaran
said
friday
the
scandal
broke
amid
the
most
triumphant
year
in
the
history
of
the
colombian
armed
forces
after
44
years
of
war
the
army
finally
seems
to
have
the
farc

or
the
revolutionary
armed
forces
of
colombia
the
countrys
largest
guerrilla
force

on
the
ropes
this
year
alone
troops
have
killed
or
captured
about
30
highranking
or
midlevel
farc
leaders
including
felipe
rincon
an
influential
rebel
ideologue
who
was
slain
in

near

the

in

entebbestyle
operation
that
freed
15
hostages
including
three
us
military
contractors
and
former
colombian
presidential
candidate
ingrid
betancourt
but
in
some
ways
military
analysts
say
the
colombian
army
has
become
a
victim
of
its
own
success
since
2002
the
number
of
colombian
troops
has
nearly
doubled
to
about
263000
as
the
army
expanded
oversight
lapsed
yet
accusations
of
human
rights
abuses
were
often
dismissed
by
officials
as
rebelinspired
campaigns
to
demoralize
the
soldiers
there
was
such
a
strong
push
to
defeat
the
farc
that
the
government
put
too
much
faith
in
the
military
and
exercised
too
little
control
said
cesar
restrepo
of
the
security
and

foundation
a
bogota

everyone
looked
the
other
way
another
problem
was
the
habit
prevalent
among
us
commanders
in
vietnam
of
measuring
progress
through
body
counts
the
top
brass
offered
promotions
cash
rewards
and

officers
in
turn
have
come
under
fierce
pressure
from
president
alvaro
uribe
who
views
the
conflict
not
as
a
civil
war
but
as
a
fight
against
terrorists
who
must
be
eliminated
last

uribe
scolded
his

whats

remorse
the

brought

the

when

from

obscurity
to
be

it
became

that

the

nothings
going

the

which

at

places
on
tuesday
after
weeks
of
recordsetting
early
voting
will
be
historic
for
many
reasons
beyond
race
and
gender
it
is
the
first
election
during
a
deep
economic
crisis
since
1932
when

franklin
d
roosevelt
routed
republican
president
herbert
hoover
as
the
nation
sank
into
the
depths
of
the
great
depression
since
then
six
presidential
campaigns
have
taken
place
during
economic
slumps
and
only
once
in
1972
has
the
party
in
charge
of
the
white
house
survived
one
of
the
safest
propositions
in
american
history
is
when
there
are
severe
economic
downturns
that
affect
millions
of
people
then
its
the
party
in
power
that
suffers
the
most
said
rice
university
political
scientist
earl
black
the
2008
election
also
is
a
rare
wartime
contest

just
the
seventh
in
a
century
in
the
past
wartime
choices
incumbent
presidents
were
reelected
all
three
times
they
ran
but
the
party
in
power
was
voted
out
of
office
in
the
three
races
when
the
incumbent
was
not
on
the
ballot
the
last
time
when
lyndon
johnson
pulled
out
of
the
1968
race
history
also
tells
us
that
american
voters
like
to
change
the
party
in
the
white
house
every
eight
years
this
years
election
is
the
sixth
time
in
the
postfdr
era
of
term
limits
that
a
party
in
power
is
trying
to
win
the
presidency
in
three
straight
elections
only
once

george
hw
bush
in
1988

did
the
in
party
succeed
its
kind
of
a
perfect
storm
for
democrats
said
jim
granato
director
of
the
university
of
houstons
center
for
public
policy
youve
got
an
unpopular
war
a
severe
economic
crisis
and
its
unusual
for
an
incumbent
party
to
win
three
consecutive
elections
the
2008
election
is
also
a
rare
generational
contest
pitting
candidates
25
years
apart
in
age
in
the
two
similar
generationgap
elections
of
the
20th
century
the
younger
candidate
baby
boomer
bill
clinton
defeated
world
war
ii
veterans
george
hw
bush
and
bob
dole
and
in
the
other
generational
shift
of
modern
times
voters
in
1960
chose
the
nations
first
roman
catholic
president
43yearold
john
f
kennedy
to
replace
68yearold
dwight
d
eisenhower
this
years
election
could
mark
the
end
of
three
decades
of
bitter
postvietnam
politics
and
with
it
the
discussions
of
swift
boats
draft
evasion
national
guard
records
and
antiwar
bomb
plots
after
all
obama
was
6
years
old
when
mccains
skyhawk
divebomber
was
shot
down
over
hanoi
the
generational
divide
is
evident
in
the
electorate
obama
holds
a
doubledigit
lead
among
voters
under
the
age
of
45
while
mccain
has
an
edge
among
voters
older
than
the
democratic
nominee
for
republicans
the
risk
is
that
the
largest
generation
in
american
history
will
become
loyal
democrats
much
as
ronald
reagan
and
franklin
roosevelt
influenced
two
different
generations
in
the
20th
century
theres
not
just
a
lost
election
at
stake
here
theres
a
lost
generation
said
democratic
strategist
james
carville
republicans
face
other
demographic
risks
this
year
hispanic
voters
who
cast
nearly
40
percent
of
their
ballots
for
republican
george
w
bush
in
2004
are
siding
with
obama
by
margins
of
about
2to1
according
to
numerous
polls
the
strong
antigop
backlash
among
latinos
has
complicated
mccains
chances
in
traditionally
republican
states
such
as
nevada
colorado
and
florida
republicans
are
in
a
very
bad
way
among
hispanics
said
university
of
houston
political
scientist
granato
despite
mccains
support
for
giving
illegal
immigrants
a
pathway
to
citizenship
he
added
the
republican
brand
is
viewed
as
being
hostile
to
immigrants
given
all
of
the
historical
precedents
that
favor
the
democrats
one
of
the
surprises
of
2008
is
that
mccain
has
remained
competitive
for
so
many
months
said
rices
black
he
points
out
that
the
republican
nominee
continues
to
hold
a
large
advantage
as
the
candidate
better
qualified
to
serve
as
commanderinchief
but
to
houston
council
member
jolanda
jo
jones
obamas
candidacy
has
made
history
she
remembers
her
mothers
stories
about
being
forced
to
drink
from
coloredonly
water
fountains
she
recalls
how
her
grandmother
rather
than
being
forced
to
sit
in
the
back
of
segregated
houston
buses
chose
to
walk
now
with
obama
running
ahead
in
polls
just
two
days
before
the
presidential
election
jones
can
hardly
believe
how
far
the
country
has
come
i
believe
that
its
probably
the
most
important
historic
event
in
my
lifetime

just
happy

the

the

resulting
in
long

our
biggest
problem
going

is
that
we

not
be
able
to
meet
the
demand
said
kim
alexander
president
of

do
we
have
the

handle
an
extremely
high

thats
the
question
that
is
weighing
on
the
minds
of
poll
workers
and
election
officials
more

1

alexander
with
the
voter
foundation
cautioned
the
public
to
be
alert
this
election
season
voters
have
to
beware
of
the
dirty
tricks
alexander
said
in
california
were
not
seeing
at
least
in
the
presidential
election
the
severity
of
dirty
tricks
occurring
in
other
states
but
they
are
popping
up
in
some
of
the
other
campaigns
and
propositions
at
the
state
and
local
levels
there
needs
to
be
some
perspective
when
it
comes
to
judging
coach
barry
melrose
making
assumptions
after
10
games
is
not
only
kneejerk
but
shows
a
lack
of
understanding
about
what
this
team
has
gone
through
since
last
season
new
owners
new
general
manager
15
new
players
if
you
include
vinny
prospal
trying
to
learn
a
new
system
and
about
each
other
a
new
coaching
staff
trying
to
mesh
and
a
training
camp
on
two
continents
that
was
great
for
bonding
but
lousy
for
the
onice
product
add
that
star
center
vinny
lecavalier
and
best
defenseman
paul
ranger
missed
camp
because
of
shoulder
surgeries
and
a
developmentstunting
schedule
that
had
the
team
play
one
game
in
10
days
and
its
not
difficult
to
figure
why
tampa
bay
got
off
to
a
slow
start
it
also
makes
that
333
october
record
look
pretty
good
melrose
who
spent
the
past
12
years
as
an
espn
analyst
should
be
evaluated
constantly
as
to
his
preparation
practice
methods
the
kind
of
game
he
wants
to
play
and
the
way
he
motivates
players
and
it
is
right
for
owners
oren
koules
and
len
barrie
and
general
manager
brian
lawton
to
demand
explanations
of
melroses
methods
and
thought
processes
and
if
there
are
concerns
to
bring
them
to
his
attention
and
expect
corrections
but
it
seems
premature
less
than
a
month
into
the
season
to
draw
the
conclusion
as
some
in
the
media
already
have
that
melrose
is
one
step
from
unemployment
tampa
bay
has
a
lot
of
very
good
players
and
potential
to
be
a
very
good
team
we
saw
it
last
week
in
two
notable
road
victories
melrose
must
maintain
the
trajectory
are
there
going
to
be
bumps
sure
it
is
even
reasonable
to
believe
melroses
leash
is
shorter
because
lawton
who
joined
the
team
in
late
june
was
not
part
of
the
hiring
process
so
consider
this
a
feelingout
process
for
them
as
well
grading
any
coach
is
an
inexact
science
it
is
even
trickier
in
tampa
bay
because
of
the
extenuating
circumstances
melrose
has
said
he
believes
he
has
less
than
a
year
to
prove
himself
the
guess
here
is
the
brass
needs
at
least
25
to
30
games
before
it
can
even
begin
evaluating
whether
melrose
was
the
right
choice
for
the
job
until
then
lets
see
what
he
can
do

emily
lehrer
a
20yearold
valley
college
student
knows
some
people
think
her
generation
is
apathetic
unmotivated
and
superficial
but
the
aspiring
thespian
begs
to
differ
she
says
her
devotion
to
politics
and
the
hotly
debated
issues
of
this
election
year
is
unquestionable
still
need
proof
i
broke
up
with
my
boyfriend
hes
way
too
conservative
she
said
im
a
flaming
liberal
and
its
all
we
ever
talked
about
it
was
just
too
much
while
the
average
young
voter
of
the
millennia
generation
might
not
go
to
such
lengths
over
politics
there
is
no
doubt
this
years
historic
election
which
could
lead
to
the
first
black
president
or
the
first
woman
vice
president
has
drawn
out
the
youth
vote
as
never
before
young
voters
from
18
to
29
have
become
one
of
the
fastestgrowing
demographics
of
this
election
season
in
los
angeles
county
registration
for
young
voters
has
doubled
from
the
previous
presidential
election
according
to
the
county
registrarrecorder
nationwide
statistics
from
this
years
presidential
primaries
show
youth
voter
turnout
also
nearly
doubled

from
9
percent
to
17
percent
excitement
generated
by
democratic
presidential
candidate
barack
obama
growing
fears
about
the
iraq
war
and
the
future
of
the
us
economy
and
sharply
divided
views
about
gay
marriage
are
expected
to
draw
many
young
voters
into
voting
booths
for
the
first
time
voter
mobilization
groups
and
political
experts
agree
that
young
voters
have
brought
an
unprecedented
amount
of
energy
to
this
presidential
campaign
we
have
the
highest
voter
turnout
in
young
people
that
weve
seen
since
they
were
eligible
to
vote
in
1972
said
donald
green
political
expert
and
professor
at
yale
university
green
was
commissioned
to
study
youth
voters
in
1996
when
young
voter
turnout
was
at
an
alltime
low
the
youth
vote
crawled
upward
in
the
elections
that
followed
but
green
said
it
isnt
until
now
that
the
power
of
the
youth
vote
has
become
evident
no
one
fully
understands
it
yet
and
it
will
take
years
to
completely
unfold
but
we
might
be
seeing
a
new
generation
of
voters
developing
their
political
habits
earlier
than
their
counterparts
did
during
the
90s
so
what
resonates
with
young
voters
green
said
his
studies
have
shown
young
people
are
less
likely
to
have
ties
to
a
candidate
based
on
political
affiliation
campaign
tactics
that
work
for
the
young
citizens
of
the
21st
century
include
persontoperson
contact
especially
via
social
network
sites
or
grassroots
meetings
that
approach
has
worked
for
groups
like
rock
the
vote
to
date
the
organization
has
had
17
million
young
voters
download
registration
applications
from
its
site
compared
to
800000
in
2004
chrissy
faessen
deputy
director
of
rock
the
vote
said
traditionally
the
largest
obstacle
to
getting
young
people
to
vote
has
been
the
registration
process
they
see
it
as
a
confusing
process
with
a
lot
of
steps
faessen
said
but
once
we
get
them
registered
they
turn
out
at
the
polls
according
to
faessen
82
percent
of
registered
young
voters
cast
a
ballot
in
2004
faessen
said
rock
the
vote
is
also
hosting
poll
place
parties
for
early
voters
and
shuttling
in
people
to
get
them
to
cast
their
ballot
early
on
a
grassroots
level
organizations
like
california
public
interest
research
group
have
perched
themselves
on
college
campuses
across
the
state
for
months
registering
students
to
vote
and
encouraging
them
to
get
more
information
on
other
ballot
measures
the
effort
to
build
interest
among
students
has
not
been
difficult
for
kate
harrington
the
campus
coordinator
for
calpirg
at
valley
college
in
north
hollywood
there
has
been
a
huge
turnout
of
people
on
campus
and
i
have
talked
to
a
bunch
who
havent
voted
in
years
and
are
now
going
to
vote
harrington
said
the
political
climate
among
young
people
is
at
a
tipping
point

young
people
are
inspired
by
the
possibilities
harrington
said
most
young
people
shes
talked
to
have
said
their
issues
during
this
election
center
on
the
war
the
environment
health
care
education
and
the
economy
still
not
all
young
voters
have
managed
to
become
engaged
in
this
election
sam
dorman
managing
director
for
the
league
of
young
voters
said
on
super
tuesday
in
this
years
primary
1
in
4
collegetrack
young
people
voted
compared
with
1
in
14
for
noncollegegoing
youth
just
like
every
other
demographic
it
takes
sustained

the

a

by
completing
all
but
two
of

just
continues

what
he
does
said
umass
coach
don

and
thats
be
efficient
run
the
offense
15
of
17
completions

he
was
special
today
and
ill
also
add
less
than
100
percent
so
taking
him
out
in
the
third
quarter
was
precautionary
the
victory
not
only
bolstered
umasss
postseason
hopes
but
avenged
a
126
loss
to
the
rams
here
a
year
ago
in
which
coen
playing
in
severe
weather
conditions
produced
by
hurricane
noel
completed
7
of
22
passes
for
22
yards
with
two
interceptions
yesterday
coen
was
a
picture
of
efficiency
he
guided
the
minutemen
to
scores
on
their
first
six
possessions
completing
882
percent
of
his

for
the
secondhighest
completion

894
percent

of

in

2004

all
i
have
to
say
this
year
is
that
there
was
no
rain
said
coen
who
departed
with

after
he
connected

i
dont
like
going
back
on

you

the

which
he
returned

to
give

a

lead
we
tried
not
to
give
cassidy
a
chance
to
breathe
today
and
we
certainly
made
his
pass
difficult
brown
said
we
played
very
very
solidly
against
the

which
made
them
truly
onedimensional

then
we
just
took

said
viveiros
so
too
was
coen
but
once
his
work
was
done
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
reflect
on
his
final
trip
home
as
a
collegian
it
really
doesnt
get
much
better
than
that
coen
said
any

you
can
sit
back
and
go
hey
i
did
what
i
had
to
do
and
the

did

the
bruins
had
long
skated
off
the
td
banknorth
garden
ice
last
night
with
a
51
win
tucked
in
their
pockets
but
marc
savard
was
still
watching
the
replays
of
the
thirdperiod
melee
marveling
especially
at
how
shane
hnidy
tuned
up
dallas
counterpart
matt
niskanen
there
is
a
faction
among
hockey
watchers
that
turns
its
collective
nose
up
at
the
fights
and
brawls
that
were
the
norm
three
decades
ago
but
last
night
one
of
the
few
occasions
when
the
gloves
drop
and
the
fists
fly
in
succession
players
become
fans
as
well
hungry
to
consume
the
rough
stuff
that
has
been
nearly
bleached
out
of
the
genteel
nhl
i
think
the
fans
may
have
had
a
flashback
to
the
old
days
on
causeway
street
said
aaron
ward
the
game
hasnt
really
gone
this
way
but
sometimes
situations
call
for
teams
rallying
together
and
sticking
up
for
each
other
thats
what
you
saw
tonight
before
last
night
the
bruins
had
practically
been
peaceniks
they
had
engaged
in
only
two
fights
all
season
a
pair
of
shawn
thornton
bouts
against
montreals
georges
laraque
and
pittsburghs
eric
godard
just
one
more
than
the
nhls
pacifists
in
detroit
and
minnesota
but
when
the
stars
led
by
agitators
sean
avery
and
steve
ott
the
new
mcfilthy
and
mcnasty
tried
to
swagger
their
way
into
the
garden
and
push
the
bruins
around
their
hosts
responded
with
their
fists
to
a
man
the
bruins
were
just
as
proud
for
the
way
they
stuck
up
for
each
other
as
they
were
with
the
result
a
victory
before
14576
fans
who
got
every
penny
of
their
moneys
worth
the
bruins
survived
a
secondperiod
barrage
in
which
tim
thomas
turned
aside
all
21
pucks
that
were
fired
his
way
marco
sturm
who
came
in
with
just
one
goal
this
season
put
two
pucks
behind
goalie
marty
turco
the
boston
penalty
kill
dead
last
in
the
league
killed
off
all
six
dallas
power
plays
including
a
45second
twoman
advantage
in
the
second
period
but
they
turned
the
agitating
ways
of
avery
and
ott
against
the
stars
shaming
dallas
and
its
goon
squad
in
a
wontbackdown
third
that
saw
the
two
clubs
rack
up
114
total
penalty
minutes
there
used
to
be
a
code
said
thornton
who
threw
down
with
krystofer
barch
in
the
only
clean
fight
of
the
game
that
if
you
did
stuff
like
that
you
had
to
answer
the
bell
but
now
were
not
allowed
to
police
the
game
ourselves
so
they
get
away
with
a
little
bit
more
the
bruins
were
first
angered
by
an
incident
early
in
the
second
period
when
ott
went
low
on
stephane
yelle
with
a
hip
check
thornton
went
after
ott
and
landed
several
punches
but
the
dallas
forward
didnt
drop
his
gloves
in
return
thornton
was
whistled
for
a
double
minor
roughing
that
caused
his
coach
no
dismay
yeah
thorny
took
a
fourminute
penalty
said
julien
but
there
was
a
guy
who
almost
took
our
players
knees
out
later
in
the
period
after
ott
belted
mark
stuart
hnidy
shed
his
gloves
and
tried
to
fight
the
agitator
again
ott
kept
his
gloves
on
at
522
another
scrum
took
place
that
saw
ott
avery
hnidy
and
milan
lucic
sent
off
for
unsportsmanlike
conduct
penalties
in
the
third
period
after
andrew
ference
cleaned
otts
clock
with
an
openice
hit
the
boston
defenseman
fought
avery
at
454
then
at
702
following
an
interference
call
on
turco
ott
went
low
again
on
lucic
appearing
to
target
the
wingers
knees
ott
and
lucic
were
whistled
for
roughing
not
really
said
lucic
when
asked
if
he
was
surprised
ott
never
wanted
to
fight
thats
what
he
tries
to
do
hes
an
agitator
im
not
really
surprised
at
931
with
the
bruins
holding
a
31
lead
patrice
bergeron
scored
the
goahead
goal
in
the
second
phil
kessel
netted
his
seventh
goal
of
the
year
in
the
third
thornton
and
barch
squared
off
both
players
landed
punches
with
thornton
managing
to
claw
off
barchs
helmet
i
felt
bad
for
barch
to
have
to
mop
up
the
mess
that
his
other
two
teammates
couldnt
finish
julien
said
but
the
biggest
explosion
took
place
after
stuart
made
it
a
41
game
avery
stapled
lucic
face
first
into
the
boards
at
1144
prompting
savard
to
jump
the
dallas
forward
and
pop
him
with
several
rights
niskanen
tried
to
come
to
averys
aid
but
was
intercepted
by
hnidy
who
delivered
a
string
of
heavy
rights
to
the
defensemans
head
avery
was
called
for
boarding
and
a
10minute
misconduct
i
think
it
was
a
hit
from
behind
savard
said
nothing
other
than
coming
in
and
helping
a
teammate
hes
got
my
back
every
night
im
not
a
tough
guy
but
just
sticking
up
for
each
other
it
wasnt
the
cleanest
hit
im
just
trying
to
help
a
teammate
it
was
getting
like
that
in
the
third
obviously
theyre
a
frustrated
team
theyve
still
got
a
couple
great
players
over
there
its
just
too
bad
a
couple
guys
do
the
things
they
do
foxborough

brandon
meriweather
was
eventually
going
to
replace
rodney
harrison
at
safety
in
the
patriots
secondary

that
was
the
longterm
plan

but
eventually
became
immediately
when
harrison
was
lost
for
the
season
with
a
torn
right
quadriceps
against
the
broncos
oct
20
the
absence
of
harrison
one
of
the
teams
spiritual
and
vocal
leaders
forced
meriweather
not
only
to
step
up
into
the
starting
lineup
last
week
against
the
rams
but
to
speak
up
as
well
nobody
expects
the
softspoken
safety
to
be
as
boisterous
as
harrison
but
meriweather
needs
to
find
his
own
voice
while
making
sure
hes
heard
when
it
comes
to
communicating
with
the
rest
of
the
secondary
all
reports
from
the
st
louis
game
were
that
communication
was
not
an
issue
with
meriweather
and
james
sanders
calling
the
shots
in
the
secondary
communication
will
be
key
again
for
the
patriots
secondary
tonight
as
it
faces
peyton
manning
and
the
colts
at
lucas
oil
stadium
manning
is
the
master
of
adjusting
to
what
look
a
defense
is
giving
him
and
meriweather
and
fellow
starting
safety
sanders
will
have
to
adjust
right
back
we
dont
put
it
all
on
one
guy
to
make
all
the
calls
and
control
everything
its
both
of
them
said
defensive
coordinator
dean
pees
they
both
have
to
make
the
calls
they
both
have
to
echo
it
to
each
other
and
to
the
corners
theyre
both
held
responsible
for
it
just
in
the
meetings
and
in
practice
and
stuff
i
didnt
see
it
as
any
different
if
it
was
rodney
and
brandon
brandon
and
james
james
and
rodney
i
didnt
see
a
whole
lot
of
difference
and
i
hope
there
isnt
any
difference
there
has
been
a
marked
difference
in
the
way
meriweather
has
performed
this
year
before
harrisons
injury
he
was
seeing
significant
playing
time
in
the
teams
nickel
and
dime
packages
despite
not
being
a
starter
until
last
week
the
secondyear
player
leads
the
patriots
in
interceptions
with
three
showing
the
range
and
ballhawking
skills
that
made
him
a
firstround
pick
24th
overall
in
2007
meriweather
also
has
shown
that
hes
not
a
milquetoast
yeah
hes
certainly
more
vocal
than
he
was
as
a
rookie
said
pees
i
would
hope
every
week
he
gets
more
and
more
so
with
the
more
things
that
he
sees
and
the
more
he
understands
not
only
our
scheme
but
he
just
understands
what
the
other
team
is
trying
to
do
so
it
has
definitely
improved
from
a
year
ago
still
the
notion
of
replacing
harrison
who
was
a
big
part
of
the
patriots
2420
victory
over
the
colts
last
season
holding
dallas
clark
to
two
catches
for
15
yards
is
enough
to
make
anyone
speechless
maybe
thats
why
meriweather
lapsed
into
patriotspeak
when
asked
about
it
i
treat
every
game
the
same
he
said
im
not
looking
at
it
like
im
a
starter
or
im
a
backup
i
just
look
at
it
like
its
another
game
that
i
have
to
go
play
its
ok
for
meriweather
to
be
laconic
with
the
media
as
long
as
he
isnt
on
the
field
fivetime
pro
bowl
safety
and
former
dallas
cowboy
darren
woodson
now
an
analyst
for
espn
said
the
ability
to
communicate
is
key
for
any
safety
you
have
to
be
a
guy
thats
vocal
said
woodson
i
relate
it
to
playing
with
roy
williams
in
dallas
williams
is
a
softspoken
guy
he
doesnt
like
to
talk
that
hurt
him
as
far
as
guys
wanting
to
know
the
call
that
just
wasnt
his
thing
brandon
will
have
to
become
more
vocal
if
he
wants
to
remain
the
guy
back
there
the
safeties
dont
get
enough
credit
as
far
as
lining
guys
up
youre
the
quarterback
in
that
secondary
communication
aside
woodson
said
having
meriweather
in
the
lineup
could
benefit
the
patriots
woodson
said
he
would
have
loved
to
have
played
with
harrison
and
called
him
an
extremely
smart
player
but
he
said
that
the
5foot11inch
200pound
meriweather
more
closely
fits
the
prototype
for
todays
sleeker
safeties

guys
like
bob
sanders
of
the
colts
ed
reed
of
the
ravens
and
troy
polamalu
of
the
steelers
who
can
cover
wide
receivers
and
tight
ends
and
cover
a
lot
of
ground
meriweather
can
go
get
it
said
woodson
rodneys
speed
and
sanderss
speed
they
dont
have
the
same
recovery
speed
and
ability
to
recover
from
hashmark
to
hashmark
said
woodson
to
harrisons
credit
he
took
an
active
role
in
grooming
both
sanders
and
meriweather
while
some
veterans
would
have
shunned
the
men
who
eventually
could
take
their
jobs
harrison
embraced
them
and
taught
them
fittingly
for
someone
as
quiet
as
meriweather
there
wasnt
a
speech
from
harrison
that
made
the
most
lasting
impact
it
was
simply
watching
how
harrison
went
about
his
business
that
spoke
volumes
hot
rod
he
more
leads
by
example
than
by
words
but
the
thing
that
he
mostly
installed
in
me
is
play
every
play
like
its
your
last
because
you
never
know
when
your
last
play
is
going
to
be
said
meriweather
thats
the
circle
of
life
in
the
nfl
somebodys
potential
last
play
could
be
the
beginning
of
another
players
elevation
its
not
a
positive
that
rodney
went
down
but
it
might
be
a
positive
in
meriweathers
career
because
he
can
grow
knowing
hes
the
guy
back
there
now
said
woodson
well
find
out
a
lot
about
him

the
red
sox
flirtation
with
moving
their
spring
training
site
to
sarasota
fla
has
come
to
an
end
in
the
wake
of
lee
countys
approval
of
a
proposal
for
a
new
stadium
last
tuesday
the
team
announced
yesterday
that
it
has
signed
an
agreement
that
will
keep
the
red
sox
in
fort
myers
fla
for
at
least
30
years
our
topline
goal
is
to
create
the
best
spring
training
environment
and
experience
in
all
of
major
league
baseball
red
sox
chief
operating
office
mike
dee
said
thats
a
big
statement
but
we
believe
we
have
a
great
opportunity
with
a
clean
slate
to
start
from
the
ground
up
and
construct
something
thats
not
only
a
great
experience
while
the
games
are
going
on
but
we
have
a
great
deal
of
fans
that
show
up
during
workouts
the
new
stadium
will
have
9999
seats
with
standing
room
and
berm
seating
that
will
increase
capacity
to
12000
city
of
palms
park
where
the
red
sox
have
played
since
1993
has
a
capacity
of
7290
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
the
new
facility
for
the
red
sox
is
that
it
will
be
a
singlesite
facility
currently
the
sox
have
minor
league
practice
facilities
in
a
different
location
the
new
park
will
be
a
combinedsite
facility
with
six
practice
fields
in
addition
to
the
stadium
the
combinedsite
facility
played
a
role
in
the
sox
decision
it
wasnt
by
itself
a
determining
factor
but
it
was
a
contributing
factor
said
dee
in
sarasota
the
sox
would
have
had
separate
locations
as
part
of
the
payne
park
site
other
factors
included
appealing
economic
terms
access
to
hotels
and
shopping
areas
and
southwest
florida
international
airports
numerous
direct
flights
from
boston
the
red
sox
will
move
into
the
new
facility
in
2012
the
new
stadium
will
be
constructed
to
resemble
fenway
dee
added
that
with
the
vacancy
coming
at
city
of
palms
park
the
sox
were
on
board
with
lee
county
attempting
to
lure
a
third
team
to
the
area
joining
the
sox
and
twins
one
piece
that
has
not
been
determined
is
the
site
of
the
new
park
lee
county
is
relying
on
local
landowners
to
donate
an
80acre
plot
according
to
dee
proposals
will
be
requested
in
the
next
week
from
developers
on
a
site
in
southern
lee
county
the
sox
will
have
input
on
the
site
decision
though
it
seemed
the
sox
were
headed
to
sarasota
the
costs
associated
with
the
new
stadium
there
were
not
as
favorable
for
them
its
fair
to
say
discussions
outside
of
lee
county
heated
up
quickly
dee
said
there
was
a
period
where
primary
discussions
would
have
taken
us
out
of
lee
county
but
the
leadership
demonstrated
over
the
last
eight
weeks
three
or
four
really
speaks
volumes
about
the
way
they
feel
about
sports
in
general
and
the
red
sox
i
dont
think
we
were
ever
one
foot
out
the
door
but
the
lee
county
folks
would
say
they
had
to
play
catch
up
there
was
just
tremendous
momentum
and
the
county
moved
mountains
between
sept
15
and
now
the
more
we
looked
around
and
the
more
the
process
moved
forward
the
more
we
became
comfortable
where
we
are
amalie
benjamin
can

at
abenjaminglobecom
its
always
interesting
to
hear
how
other
people
around
baseball
think
the
red
sox
will
approach
their
offseason
the
perception
of
a
few
baseball
officials
is
that
the
sox
priority
is
to
come
up
with
a
catcher
whether
its
bringing
back
jason
varitek
or
going
another
route
one
scout
said
theyll
try
to
take
care
of
the
catching
first
and
then
see
whats
out
there
and
explore
a
guy
like
mark
teixeira
or
jake
peavy
or
cc
sabathia
or
aj
burnett
they
might
even
explore
prince
fielder
because
they
know
the
yankees
will
but
think
about
it
they
dont
have
to
do
a
whole
lot
they
came
within
a
game
of
going
to
the
world
series
there
are
teams
looking
to
see
what
the
sox
do
with
mike
lowell
who
told
team
officials
after
his
hip
surgery
that
its
the
best
hes
felt
in
three
years
in
terms
of
range
of
motion
and
lack
of
pain
the
real
test
will
come
in
spring
training
the
other
speculation
revolves
around
coco
crisp
and
julio
lugo
a
national
league
general
manager
said
crisp
has
value
he
played
very
well
hes
fast
a
great
defender
lugo
is
a
tougher
sell
because
of
his
contract
and
the
fact
hes
coming
off
an
injury
but
just
look
at
the
shortstop
market
and
you
can
see
thered
be
a
limited
market
but
a
market
for
him
nonetheless
whos
the
one
guy
teams
would
love
to
pry
from
the
sox
justin
masterson
said
an
american
league
gm
ill
bet
you
the
red
sox
hear
that
name
called
a
lot
in
their
trade
talks
i
think
the
other
guy
is
jacoby
ellsbury
the
hope
is
the
red
sox
are
down
on
him
and
would
move
him
thats
probably
just
a
hope
i
never
really
understood
why
there
arent
more
swap
meet
type
deals
in
baseball
as
in
you
take
what
i
cant
use
and
ill
take
what
you
cant
use
there
was
a
consensus
among
the
general
managers
i
spoke
to
last
week
that
they
wouldnt
mind
making
those
types
of
deals
but
they
rarely
happen
anyway
may
i
suggest
we
set
up
a
few
tables
for
a
swap
meet
at
this
weeks
gm
meetings
in
dana
point
calif
with
the
items
consisting
of
players
who
are
overpriced
underperforming
too
old
or
not

one
national

owner
encourages
his
gm
to
make
these
types
of
deals
because
owners
hate
dead
payroll
theyd
rather
swap
bad
contracts
to
see
if
a
change
of
scenery
works
but
gms
fear
theyll
be
ridiculed
if
the
deals
flop
matching
salaries
is
the
hard
part
but
the
red
sox
for
instance
could
deal
julio
lugo
18
million
left
on
his
contract
to
the
tigers
who
need
a
shortstop
for
a
lefthander
such
as
robertson
17
million
or
willis
22
million
could
john
farrell
straighten
out
those
guys
sanchez
mora
or
hall
would
seem
to
fit
as
third
basemen
in
minnesota
but
what
could
go
back
the
other
way
could
lugo
go
for
tejada
molina
might
be
a
nice
fit
for
the
sox
if
they
cant
work
something
out
with
jason
varitek
but
lugo
might
be
a
hard
sell
to
the
giants
even
if
there
was
some
enhancement
with
the
money
could
the
angels
do
something
with
fukudome
and
perhaps
rid
themselves
of
matthewss
remaining
three
years
at
30
million
matthews
who
just
had
knee
surgery
had
a
good
end
to
the
season
and
might
help
the
cubs
byrnes
at
two
years
22
million
and
recovering
from
hamstring
injuries
brings
a
lot
of
energy
and
might
be
a
good
fit
for
a
team
like
the
white
sox
who
needs
a
change
of
scenery
more
than
jones
who
is
31
and
has
one
year
left
at
19
million
those
closest
to
him
indicate
theres
no
way
jones
wants
to
return
to
los
angeles
where
the
fans
were
tough
he
had
knee
surgeries
early
in
the
year
and
late
in
the
year
and
he
wasnt
around
the
team
at
all
during
the
playoffs
one
nl
scout
said
is
he
done
i
wouldnt
say
that
but
hes
probably
not
the
guy
who
hit
50
home
runs
he
can
still
play
the
outfield
and
he
needs
to
get
in
shape
mike
easler
joness
hitting
coach
for
the
first
half
of
the
year
with
the
dodgers
said
andruw
is
a
very
sensitive
guy
and
once
everyone
started
getting
on
him
it
was
tough
on
him
he
has
to
change
his
approach
to
hitting
he
was
trying
to
hit
everything
out
but
he
would
be
someone
worth
taking
a
chance
on
because
hes
not
done
and
he
has
a
lot
to
prove
to
people
fukudome
three
years
38
million
left
is
a
very
sensitive
kid
who
doesnt
seem
to
fit
with
lou
piniellas
hardnosed
style
fukudome
according
to
one
baseball
official
has
much
more
talent
than
hes
shown
he
has
ability
and
he
plays
the
game
right
but
thats
not
a
good
place
for
him
there
are
risks
but
if
youre
trading
your
risk
for
someone
elses
risk
why
not
i
think
change
of
scenery
is
key
said
an
nl
scout
so
many
guys
just
dont
play
well
in
a
certain
market
jones
is
a
good
example
he
was
very
comfortable
in
atlanta
and
he
goes
to
la
and
he
just
cant
take
it
paid
tribute
paying
scant
attention
homefield
advantage
comes
in
different
forms
and
steelers
quarterback
ben
roethlisberger

that
he
was
preparing
for
an
unusual
road
challenge
in

nights
game
at
washington
the
redskins
cheerleaders
roethlisberger
relayed
that
in
past
preseason
games
the
cheerleaders
strategically
seemed
to
be
warming
up
outside
the
visitors
locker
room
his
point
while
quarterbacks
might
be
happy
to
see
shoddy
coverage
on
the
field
the
lack
of
coverage
from
the
cheerleaders
proved
to
be
quite
the
distraction
the
biggest
loser
last
year
the
dolphins
lost
their
first
13
games
before
posting
a
win
thus
they
avoided
becoming
the
first
winless
team
since
the
expansion
1976
buccaneers
the
bengals
08
and

are

the

theyve

the

played

of
486
minutes
21
seconds
in
eight
games
they
have

43
minutes
20
seconds
records
are
within
his
reach
the
texans
have
won
three
in
a
row
but
receiver
andre
johnson
was
sizzling
even
before
the
winning
streak
johnson
can
set
two
nfl
records
today
in
minnesota
as
he
looks
to
become
the
first
player
to
record
five
consecutive
games
of
130
or
more
receiving
yards
and
the
first
player
with
four
consecutive
games
of
at

10
receptions

ryan
clark
after
etching
the
number

into
his

black
to
honor
the
late
sean
taylor
a
former

clark
was
fined
5000
by
the

but
the
fine
apparently
isnt
going
to
stop
clark
from
doing
it
again
he
is
out
with
a
shoulder
injury
this
week
but
said

at

as

they

said
safety
bob
sanders
who
should
be
back
in
the

after
missing
five
games
with
a
high

sprain
but
its
something
that
you
have
to
go
through
eventually
in
this
league
and
everyone
goes
through
it
yet
its
still
a
shock
for

whose

have
won
five
straight
division

and
have
missed
the

only
once
since
1998
at
this
point
the
colts
happily
would
settle
for
any
postseason
berth
its
not
a
desperate
situation
said
coach
tony
dungy
who
had
three
consecutive
teams
at
tampa
bay
that
started
34
and
made
the
playoffs
i
showed
the
team
where
we
are
right
in
the
hunt
of
the
afc
there
are
probably
12
or
13
teams
right
now
that
are
fighting
for
the
playoffs
there
are
teams
that
are
34
like
us
but
theyve
won
their
last
three
games
there
are
teams
that
are
43
and
maybe
dont
feel
as
good
as
we
do
last
year
the
chargers
lost
three
of
their
first
four
games
and
still
beat
the
colts
in
the
playoffs
nfl
football
is
really
still
about
november
and
december
said
dungy
whose
team
went
a
collective
3715
in
those
two
months
over
the
past
six
years
if
you
are
playing
well
at
that
time
of
year
then
that
is
what
counts
the
giants
proved
that
last
year
pittsburgh
did
a
couple
of
years
ago
you
dont
want
to
dig
yourself
in
too
much
of
a
hole
but
certainly
the
season
isnt
over
on
sept
30
or
oct
30
even
the
colts
still
have
ample
time
to
turn
things
around
along
with
a
favorable
schedule
six
of
their
remaining
opponents
have
losing
records
and
the
bengals
and
lions
whom
they
play
back
to
back
in
december
are
a
combined
015
we
just
have
to
learn
from
the
stuff
thats
happened
and
move
forward
said
kicker
adam
vinatieri
we
just
have
to
find
a
way
to
play
better
make
less
mistakes
less
penalties
less
everything
winning
is
contagious
and
so
is
losing
injuries
have
hurt
the
record
has
a
few
explanatory
footnotes
manning
whos
off
to
his
worst
start
10
touchdown
passes
9
interceptions
a
790
rating
since
his
rookie
year
missed
most
of
training
camp
and
all
of
the
exhibition
season
after
undergoing
two
midsummer
knee
surgeries
the
offensive
line
has
been
patchworkinprogress
until
recently
joseph
addai
the
top
running
back
missed
the
last
two
games
with
a
hamstring
injury
and
sanders
voted
the
leagues
best
defender
last
year
has
played
in
only
two
games
the
colts
creed
no
excuses
no
explanations
forbids
them
from
reciting
that
woeful
litany
besides
new
england
has
had
even
worse
misfortunes

quarterback
tom
brady
running
back
laurence
maroney
and
safety
rodney
harrison
all
down
for
the
season
and
the
cornerback
corps
depleted
and
yet
the
patriots
are
52
and
tied
for
their
division
lead
they
do
it
better
than
anybody
ive
seen
said
dungy
they
dont
seem
to
worry
about
adversity
they
dont
worry
about
who
cant
play
frankly
weve
taken
a
lesson
from
them
ive
illustrated
them
in
the
past
as
to
how
they
do
it
they
get
everybody
ready
to
go
the
healthy
guys
play
as
well
as
they
can
and
the
new
guys
do
their
job
theyve
been
an
example
for
everyone
over
the
years
the
colts
have
been
losing
because
they
havent
been
getting
the
job
done
when
it
matters
the
offense
has
lost
its
pyrotechnic
pop
and
the
defense
cant
get
off
the
field
i
think
our
whole
team
is
in
a
slump
right
now
observed
dungy
whose
squad
hasnt
lost
more
than
four
regularseason
games
since
2002
its
a
team
game
everybody
is
in
it
we
have
to
break
out
of
it
usually
its
just
fundamentals
and
doing
things
a
little
bit
sharper
i
wouldnt
put
it
on
one
person
at
all
im
in
a
slump
the
offense
doesnt
look
anything
like
the
highspeed
machine
that
usually
averages
around
28
points
a
game
the
rushing
attack
734
yards
per
game
is
the
leagues
worst
manning
whose
rating
puts
him
22d
in
the
league
has
been
throwing
picks
and
missing
receivers
whove
also
been
dropping
balls
it
seems
every
time
that
one
part
of
our
offense
is
failing
said
saturday
whether
it
be
the
offensive
line
not
giving
him
enough
time
not
getting
open
the
ball
not
being
in
the
right
place
whatever
it
may
be
everybody
takes
their
turn
not
getting
it
done
the
defense
which
gave
up
25
straight
points
in
the
second
half
at
tennessee
cant
get
stops
when
it
has
to
on
the
titans
gametying
drive
in
the
third
quarter
indianapolis
gave
them
a
first
down
on
their
own
42
with
an
illegalcontact
penalty
then
another
first
down
on
the
colts
18
on
a
pass
interference
call
in
our
defense
you
shouldnt
get
pass
interference
and
illegalcontact
penalties
said
dungy
we
just
shouldnt
so
its
a
little
baffling
to
me
gutcheck
time
with
dysfunction
on
both
sides
of
the
ball
the
colts
know
they
have
to
get
on
the
same
page
quickly
before
the
season
spirals
out
of
control
as
it
did
in
2001
when
they
lost
five
straight
after
starting
43
prompting
coach
jim
moras
classic
playoffs
playoffs
rant
this
is
a
good
mental
test
right
now
said
manning
this
is
when
you
find
out
a
lot
about
what
youre
made
of
its
easy
to
feel
good
and
be
happy
when
youre
undefeated
but
when
youre
34
and
your
backs
up
against
the
wall
its
what
we
call
gutcheck
time
if
theres
a
hidden
blessing
amid
this
startling
downturn
it
may
be
that
the
colts
have
been
forced
into
playoff
mode
two
months
earlier
than
usual
we
kind
of
liked
it
the
other
way
when
we
were
floating
along
and
cruising
confessed
dungy
ive
been
in
both
situations
and
this
believe
it
or
not
is
more
the
reality
of
the
nfl
its
not
commonplace
to
have
those
kinds
of
starts
that
we
had
we
certainly
appreciated
them
and
we
didnt
take
them
for
granted
when
we
were
going
through
them
ive
been
with
a
lot
of
teams
that
hit
the
ground
running
this
way
and
improved
in
november
and
december
and
played
great
so
thats
what
were
looking
to
do
except
for
the
titans
everyone
else
in
the
afc
south
is
34
and
the
colts
are
only
a
game
out
of
a
wildcard
spot
so
nobody
in
blue
is
panicking
just
yet
we
do
know
that
theres
a
lot
of
season
left
to
be
played
and
anything
can
happen
and
theres
still
a
chance
for
us
said
tight
end
dallas
clark
were
definitely
not
checking
out
yet
no
matter
what
some
people
may
be
saying
or
whatever
you
hear
obviously
the
goal
is
to
have
a
chance
to
be
playing
for
something
in
the
end
said
manning
but
right
now
the
immediate
goal
is
to
try
to
get
that
one
win
and
see
if
we
can
build
off
of
that
john

backtoback
championships
is
still
a
realistic
goal
for
the
celtics
but
backtoback
game
situations
might
not
be
a
team
strength
this
season
judging
by
a
9579
loss
to
the
indiana
pacers
last
night
the
celtics
had
an
80
record
in
the
second
of
consecutive
night
games
last
season
following
a
9680
win
over
chicago
at
td
banknorth
garden
boston
friday
though
the
celtics
displayed
the
fatigue
of
a
late
arrival
they
were
also
victims
of
some
aggressive
and
tactically
sound
defending
by
the
pacers
who
were
playing
their
home
opener
we
dont
have
to
worry
about
that
streak
anymore
celtics
coach
doc
rivers
said
we
started
off
bad
we
were
bad
all
game
sloppy
plays
missed
free
throws
i
dont
know
if
it
was
them
or
us
but
lets
give
it
to
them
they
just
played
so
much
harder
than
us
and
thats
rare
for
us
they
really
moved
the
ball
which
we
didnt
do
and
thats
rare
for
us
one
thing
were
going
to
learn
is
we
cant
come
out
flat
because
we
are
going
to
get
every
teams
best
and
if
we
come
out
flat
we
are
going
to
get
our
butts
whipped
and
thats
what
happened
there
were
signs
early
on
this
was
not
going
to
be
the
celtics
night
the
celtics
went
356
of
the
opening
quarter
without
a
field
goal
indiana
going
on
a
196
run
extending
into
the
second
quarter
which
helped
the
hosts
take
a
4841
halftime
lead
the
third
quarter
symbolized
the
celtics
performance

they
committed
seven
turnovers
and
were
3
for
9
at
the
foul
line
we
just
didnt
play
well
in
any
aspect
of
the
game
rivers
said
it
was
amazing
we
were
down
9
10
it
was
a
miracle
we
didnt
deserve
to
win
that
game
we
werent
going
to
make
a
run
the
way
we
were
playing
it
was
just
not
possible
the
celtics
actually
demonstrated
a
commitment
to
defense
indiana
star
danny
granger

20

losing

a
result
but
the
pacers
defending
and
the
celtics
lack
of
shooting
accuracy
27
for
78
346
percent
and
propensity
for
committing
traveling
violations
were
decisive
things
continued
to
degenerate
in

indiana

to
where
we
should
turn
the
ball
over
they
are
a
help
defensive
team
but
we
didnt
make
the
right
play
and
forced
the
shot
when
we
should
have
got
a
better
look
we
let
our
guard
down
we
were
down
8
10
14
points
and
never
cut
into
the
lead
we
were
in
that
situation
a
lot
of
times
last
year
and
never
let
it
slip
away
like
that
we
never
got
beat
like
that
since
weve
been
together
the
game
tipped
off
at
715
pm
about
15
hours
after
the
celtics
checked
in
at
their
hotel
it
was
a
combination
of
a
lot
of
things
said
pierce
of
the
teams
worst
regularseason
defeat
since
a
11092
loss
to
utah
march
14
you
cant
point
a
finger
at
one
thing

free
throw
shooting
turnovers
lack
of
defense
weve
got
to
expect
every
teams
best
especially
on
the
road
their
home
opener
we
really
got
caught
up
in
yelling
at
the
referees
didnt
keep
our
composure
indiana
played
well
defensively
but
we
had
a
lot
of
looks
they
just
didnt
fall
for
us
we
just
have
to
get
in
the
gym
and
focus
on
the
next
three
days
we
cant
go
in
to
houston
tuesday
and
play
like
this
got
the
word
out
a
few
questions
for
new
milwaukee
manager
ken
macha
youve
been
out
since
2006
were
you
beginning
to
think
you
wouldnt
get
back
km
i
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
just
spoke
to
willie
randolph
and
hed
like
to
work
again
so
i
gave
him
some
advice
last
year
there
were
six
openings
and
i
didnt
get
an
interview
so
this
past
year
i
went
out
to
spring
training
and
got
myself
out
there
i
spoke
to
five
gms
and
a
few
team
presidents
and
i
made
sure
they
knew
i
was
available
and
i
wanted
back
in
thats
what
youve
got
to
do
youve
got
to
make
sure
people
know
you
want
a
job
again
you
have
to
be
persistent
i
know
you
had
to
answer
a
lot
of
questions
about
players
turning
on
you
in
oakland
but
you
dont
believe
that
was
the
case
km
we
had
been
swept
by
the
tigers
in
the
playoffs
and
there
was
a
lot
of
frustration
from
everybody
ive
always
respected
players
you
can
ask
barry
zito
and
all
the
guys
who
played
for
me
they
enjoyed
it
it
was
tough
at
times
with
external
forces
at
play
you
have
to
be
able
to
manage
your
team
youre
inheriting
good
young
talent
but
the
top
two
guys
in
the
rotation
cc
sabathia
and
ben
sheets
might
be
gone
km
in
all
likelihood
sabathia
is
going
to
receive
a
bigmoney
offer
and
sheets
is
testing
the
waters
general
manager
doug
melvin
said
were
going
to
offer
them
contracts
and
we
certainly
have
a
staff
of
some
other
pitchers
who
have
performed
at
a
high
level
in
the
majors
certainly
one
of
my
concerns
is
the
bullpen
so
we
need
to
take
care
of
that
cant
believe
you
left
nesn
for
this
km
loved
doing
it
the
people
treated
me
very
nicely
with
mike
singletary
verbally
undressing
one
of
his
players
in
a
press
conference
and
his
behindthescenes
undressing
of
himself
to
motivate
his
team
things
in
san
francisco
just
became
a
whole
lot
more
interesting
can
such
a
holdnothingback
approach
work
in
todays
nfl
the
49ers
are
off
this
weekend
so
there
will
be
no
immediate
onfield
answers
but
in
the
opinion
of
one
observer
close
to
the
scene
initial
reactions
among
players
coaches
and
team
employees
to
singletarys
rants
have
been
mixed

some
feel
it
was
necessary
others
feel
hes
bordering
on
out
of
control
it
started
when
singletary
in
his
first
game
as
interim
coach
told
tight
end
vernon
davis
to
hit
the
showers
during
last
sundays
embarrassing
3413
loss
to
the
seahawks
davis
had
been
flagged
for
unnecessary
roughness
and
singletary
didnt
like
his
reaction
as
he
arrived
to
the
sideline
so
he
told
him
to
get
lost
then
gave
him
a
public
lashing
when
answering
questions
from
reporters
after
the
game
later
in
the
week
it
was
learned
that
singletary
also
used
a
unique
motivational
technique
to
get
his
teams
attention
at
halftime
pulling
down
his
pants
his
point
was
that
the
49ers
were
getting
their
butt
kicked
and
they
should
be
embarrassed
to
some
oldergeneration
fans
singletary
is
surely
a
breath
of
fresh
air
a
blast
from
the
past
when
nononsense
coaches
ruled
with
an
iron
fist
but
can
that
work
today
this
isnt
like
some
disney
movie
where
you
can
keep
screaming
at
a
team
for
days
and
theyll
come
back
and
run
through
a
brick
wall
for
you
said
former
linebacker
chad
brown
who
played
in
the
nfl
from
19932007
i
think
it
can
work
once
or
twice
not
over
the
long
term
but
a
lot
depends
on
the
makeup
of
the
team
id
imagine
that
would
get
old
pretty
quick
with
an
older
veteran
type
of
team
brown
pointed
to
giants
coach
tom
coughlin
as
an
example
of
an
ultraintense
disciplineminded
coach
who
nearly
lost
his
grip
on
players
before
loosening
a
bit
an
oldschool
guy
keeping
an
open
mind
to
newschool
methods
singletary
acknowledged
last
week
that
hes
from
the
old
school
having
played
under
firebreathing
mike
ditka
and
aggressiveminded
buddy
ryan
who
once
punched
a
fellow
assistant
coach
on
the
sideline
longtime
nfl
coach
dan
reeves
believes
theres
still
a
place
in
the
game
for
that
type
of
approach
as
long
as
its
genuine
i
dont
think
being
extremely
demonstrative
is
a
bad
thing
as
long
as
youre
being
yourself
because
players
fans
and
everyone
else
will
pick
up
a
phony
quicker
than
anything
said
reeves
i
believe
players
want
to
do
the
right
things
they
want
to
be
disciplined
they
want
to
know
how
to
win
and
i
think
mike
singletary
can
relate
to
players
that
way
still
reeves
believes
that
type
of
approach
was
easier
to
adopt
in
the
1980s
when
singletary
was
in
the
midst
of
his
hall
of
fame
playing
career
the
greatest
motivator
in
that
period
of
time
was
fear

the
fear
that
youd
lose
your
job

and
that
fear
pushed
you
and
made
you
the
best
you
can
possibly
be
he
said
a
lot
of
that
has
been
taken
away
by
guaranteed
salaries
and
signing
bonuses
it
is
human
nature
that
if
you
guarantee
something
that
person
isnt
going
to
be
as
fearful
it
takes
an
unusual
person
to
not
be
affected
by
that
former
ravens
offensive
lineman
mike
flynn
who
grew
up
in
agawam
and
played
from
19972007
doubts
that
players
will
respond
if
singletary
continues
with
this
approach
the
biggest
thing
is
that
these
guys
are
professionals
he
said
and
it
sounds
good
in
theory
and
it
might
work
in
high
school
and
college
but
these
guys
are
men
its
hard
to
disrespect
them
and
treat
them
a
certain
way
and
then
not
have
some
kind
of
consequences
i
know
mike
from
baltimore
and
he
definitely
was
an
oldschool
guy
hes
going
to
be
like
that
in
san
francisco
if
it
doesnt
work
out
there
hes
going
to
be
that
way
somewhere
else
the
key
is
what
kind
of
respect
does
he
have
from
the
guys
if
the
guys
respect
him
and
listen
to
him
and
believe
what
he
has
to
say
that
will
be
fine
and
theyll
let
it
go
but
if
hes
a
guy
thats
yelling
and
screaming
and
nobody
respects
what
hes
saying
its
only
going
to
make
a
bad
situation
worse
on
the
flip
side
flynn
took
note
that
he
hadnt
heard
another
49ers
player
defend
davis
which
might
be
an
indication
that
its
been
wellreceived

for
now
you
may
be
able
to
turn
around
a
few
guys
get
them
going
in
the
right
direction
but
eventually
you
have
to
change
your
tone
and

not
give
in
to
the
player
so
to
speak

but
be
more
playerfriendly
and
realize
youre
dealing
with
men
flynn
said
screaming
and
hollering
only
motivates
you
so
much
others
such
as
former
patriots
corey
dillon
and
artrell
hawkins
are
buying
in
i
agree
with
mike
100
percent
and
i
think
that
approach
can
work
today
dillon
said
when
i
came
to
new
england
i
had
to
put
a
lot
of
my
own
personal
stuff
on
hold
and
check
my
ego
at
the
door
to
get
on
the
same
page
with
the
head
coach
and
organization
hes
nobs
and
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
bill
belichick
added
hawkins
i
think
his
style
can
be
successful
because
hes
not
just
a
coach
he
was
a
player
on
the
highest
level
so
you
consider
the
source
every
coach
cant
do
it
mike
singletary
can
too
expensive
touching
the
bases
apropos
of
nothing
1
are
the
pittsburgh
pirates
still
in
the
league
2
orlando
cabrera
is
still
the
best
free
agent
shortstop
out
there
3
great
to
hear
that
the
late
ed
kenney
will
be
inducted
into
the
red
sox
hall
of
fame
next
friday
night
4
id
love
to
be
cole
hamels
right
now
5
mark
mulder
would
be
the
one
injury
guy
id
take
a
chance
on
signing
playing
catchup
the
only
way
the
indians
would
part
with
catcher
kelly
shoppach
is
if
they
got
a
young
closer
in
return
which
means
the
sox
would
have
to
part
with
someone
like
justin
masterson
third
base
is
another
need
in
cleveland
with
houstons
ty
wigginton
on
the
radar
the
rangers
have
catching
depth
but
probably
arent
parting
with
prospect
taylor
teagarden
and
the
sox
are
pretty
split
organizationally
on
gerald
laird
who
has
matured
quite
a
bit
from
his
younger
days
but
the
best
bet
continues
to
be
jarrod
saltalamacchia
whom
the
sox
could
groom
while
a
veteran

jason
varitek
bengie
molina
pudge
rodriguez

keeps
the
seat
warm
for
a
year
or
two
changes
at
the
top
a
couple
of
ownership
management
things
to
watch
in
san
diego
john
moores
looks
to
be
seeking
a
buyer
for
his
share
of
the
team
moores
is
going
through
a
divorce
and
his
wife
shares
control
of
the
team
the
blue
jays
despite
naming
paul
beeston
as
interim
ceopresident
are
trying
to
find
a
permanent
person
and
are
interviewing
two
fairly
wellknown
baseball
people
with
experience
in
other
markets
according
to
a
major
league
source
wheeling
and
dealing

the
yankees
have
been
very
aggressive
in
calling
teams
to
see
who
might
be
available
they
called
the
astros
about
roy
oswalt
and
lance
berkman
and
were
told
they
were
not
going
to
be
dealt

the
mets
are
still
eyeing
mariners
free
agent
raul
ibanez
they
need
a
consistent
hitter
in
the
outfield
and
ibanez
seems
to
fit
what
gm
omar
minaya
is
looking
for

dont
rule
out
the
dodgers
as
a
possibility
for
jake
peavy
apparently
there
are
no
qualms
about
trading
within
the
division
the
dodgers
certainly
have
the
young
players
that
san
diego
would
desire
including
young
pitching
jonathan
broxton
seems
to
be
a
target
the
braves
are
also
still
very
much
in
the
hunt
and
dont
be
surprised
if
the
phillies
get
into
it
if
peavy
waives
his
notrade

the
angels
have
made
signing
mark
teixeira
their
no
1
priority
and
teixeira
himself
would
love
to
stay
there
but
heres
the
problem
the
angels
management
style
is
to
go
in
hard
and
get
it
done
quickly
while
agent
scott
boras
would
rather
allow
the
market
to
develop
and
get
other
teams
involved
for
that
reason
the
red
sox
have
a
chance
tigers
ready
to
change
stripes
one
of
the
most
interesting
teams
to
watch
at
the
winter
meetings
will
be
the
tigers
if
its
true
they
are
looking
to
cut
payroll
then
someone
like
magglio
ordonez
could
become
available
ordonez
a
312
career
hitter
with
seven
100rbi
seasons
will
be
paid
18
million
in
2009
and
has
options
for
2010
18
million
and
2011
15
million
if
the
tigers
are
looking
to
regain
some
of
the
younger
talent
they
lost
in
the
miguel
cabrera
and
edgar
renteria
deals
this
is
the
player
who
can
fetch
them
another
player
the
tigers
are
dangling
is
setup
man
fernando
rodney
they
are
desperately
looking
for
someone
to
close
suitors
may
be
lacking
one
nl
official
thinks
theres
a
limited
market
for
varitek
and
doesnt
buy
detroit
as
a
destination
for
him
with
the
tigers
trying
to
cut
payroll
and
with
jason
getting
up
there
in
years
i
think
the
best
bet
is
staying
in
boston
said
the
official
hes
more
valuable
to
them
than
he
is
to
anyone
else
he
knows
the
pitching
staff
if
he
goes
someplace
else
his
great
ability
to
work
with
pitchers
wont
come
into
effect
until
he
learns
a
whole
new
staff
especially
if
he
goes

things
havent
been
the
same
here
since
indianapolis
was
stunned
by
the
san

chargers
in
the
playoffs
last
winter
denying
us
a
chance
to
see
manning
back
at
gillette
for
another
conference
championship
showdown
folks
in
indy
were
still
getting
over
the
playoff
loss
when
manning
had
surgery
on
a
staphinfected
bursa
in
his
left
knee
in
july
mannings
recovery
was
slowed
by
a
second
procedure
on
the
knee
he
missed
all
of
training
camp
patriots
fans
gave
little
mind
to
details
of

woes
until
brady
experienced
difficulties
after
his

bottom

manning
who
has
never

is
not
the

player
and
these
are
not
the

he
has
10
touchdown
passes
and
nine
interceptions
matt

quarterback
doesnt
have
as
many
weapons
nor
does
he
have
enough
time
to
get
rid
of
the
ball
his
timing
and
rhythm
have
been
shortcircuited
and
he
has
been
forced
to
play
from
behind
all
season
the
colts
could
easily
be
16
they
havent
been
able
to
run
the
ball
and
for
the
first
four
weeks
of
the
season
they
couldnt
stop
anybodys
running
game
but
they
are
still
dangerous
they
are
desperate
and
they
are
at
home

just
like
the
chargers
were
when
bill
belichick
and
his
players
toured
california
last
month
the
colts
also
are
getting
some
players
back
from
injury
including
running
back
joseph
addai
and

bob

its
a
combustible
mix
for

team
learning
to
live
without
brady
depleted
in
both
backfields
even
with
a
hoodied
genius
plugging

its
difficult
to
win
without
talent

experience
at
cornerback
and
safety
especially
against
manning
playing
at
home
on
a
dry
fast
surface

we
have

so
many

with

it

hopefully
we

go
they
will

patriots
chairman
and
ceo
robert
kraft
and
his
family
completed
an
agreement
last
week
to
become
the
title
sponsors
of
the
israeli
football
league
which
steve
leibowitz

president
of
american
football
in
israel

called
a
significant
development
to
assist
in
the
longterm
plan
to
build
tackle
football
in
israel
from
the
ground
up
having
the
kraft
family
as
the
title
sponsor
gives
the
league
the
credibility
it
needs
to
immediately
be
branded
a
serious
endeavor
and
also
provides
the
financing
needed
to
ensure
a
smooth
development
he
wrote
in
an
email
the
league
now
in
its
second
season
will
have
five
teams
two
in
jerusalem
one
each
in
haifa
tel
aviv
and
modiin
expansion
is
already
scheduled
for
2009
with
an
agreement
in
place
for
patriots
tight
end
benjamin
watson
to
sponsor
the
new
team
in
beersheva
prior
to
2007
the
only
organized
football
played
in
israel
was
flag
football
with
about
90
teams
and
more
than
1000
players
now
we
feel
that
we
are
ready
to
develop
tackle
football
leibowitz
said
mr
kraft
is
now
fully
behind
the
idea
because
israelis
are
playing
the
game
around
the
country
and
this
is
the
best
way
to
spread
the
game
to
the
general
public
mike
keenan
his
stay
behind
the
boston
bench
brief
74
games
in
200001
earned
his
iron
mike
reputation
via
his
stern
demanding
oftunpredictable
approach
with
players
in
particular
while
in
philadelphia
and
chicago
in
his
earlier
days
holding
court
with
a
small
collection
of
boston
media
last
week
outside
the
flames
dressing
room
the
59yearold
bench
boss
sounded
more
like
mellow
mike
when
asked
if
he
can
scare
players
in
todays
hockey
i
dont
know
if
the
word
is
scared
said
keenan
i
think
you
have
to
develop
a
sense
of
urgency
in
your
players
and
they
have
to
see
that
youre
passionate
about
winning
but
scared
i
dont
think
i
ever
scared
chris
chelios
at
all

or
other
players
like
mark
howe
dave
poulin
or
michel
goulet
sure
at
times
maybe
i
kept
things
a
little
bit
imbalanced
but
i
think
they
came
to
embrace
it
and
enjoy
it
how
about
mark
messier
in
new
york
the
year
199394
keenan
coached
the
rangers
to
the
stanley
cup
i
didnt
scare
him
said
keenan
he
embraced
the
competition
all
true
today
in
calgary
said
keenan
where
he
has
a
builtin
leader
in
jarome
iginla
to
wrap
both
arms
around
any
and
every
challenge
i
dont
have
to
say
anything
to
him
said
keenan
he
just
senses
the
times
when
he
has
to
say
ok
weve
got
to
step
it
up
here
boys
after
that
guys
like
robyn
regehr
and
dion
phaneuf
they
all
step
in
line
you
get
that
kind
of
cohesiveness
and
then
your
goaltender
does
the
job
then
you
have
a
competitive
team
at
the
mention
of
iginlas
name
a
member
of
bostons
electronic
media
noted
that
the
winger
was
his
favorite
nonbruin
in
the
nhl
really
i
thought
joe
thornton
would
be
said
keenan
the
coach
who
summoned
the
best
out
of
jumbo
joe
in
boston
because
hes
a
pretty
good
player
too
spurs
great
david
robinson
was
not
able
to
repeat
as
an
nba
champion
getting
two
attempts
in
his
illustrious
career
while
he
believes
the
celtics
have
the
talent
to
repeat
he
warns
that
it
wont
be
easy
things
got
to
go
right
said
robinson
physically
you
got
be
healthy
good
things
have
to
happen
they
have
the
nucleus
back
they
look
good
they
look
like
they
can
make
it
happen
but
there
has
to
be
a
lot
of
little
things
rolling
into
place
too
i
remember
one
year
timmy
duncan
got
hurt
and
he
wasnt
even
available
for
the
playoffs
and
thats
stuff
you
cant
forget
it
happens
you
have
to
keep
your
fingers
crossed
and
keep
playing
hard
but
theyre
in
a
great
position
to
do
it
though
on
the
spurs
robinson
said
theyre
great
manu
ginobili
is
going
to
be
out
a
little
bit
with
an
ankle
injury
but
timmy
looks
great
he
got
some
real
rest
this
summer
tony
parkers
at
the
top
of
his
game
they
have
a
lot
of
question
marks
on
some
young
guys
theyre
going
to
need
some
guys
to
make
some
shots
but
we
got
the
pieces
robinson
was
in
boston
on
business
last
week
and
to
support
his
exspurs
teammate
doc
rivers
as
the
celtics
opened
the
season
with
a
win
over
cleveland
im
just
being
a
dad
a
lot
and
cheering
those
guys
in
san
antonio
robinson
said
of
his
life
now
im
just
trying
to
keep
life
on
the
simple
side
i
just
started
a
business
im
working
on
that
a
little
bit
and
trying
to
get
that
kicked
off
his
superman
nickname
was
snatched
away
by
dwight
howard
he
is
no
longer
the
most
intimidating
force
in
sports
let
alone
basketball
and
while
his
politically
incorrect
sense
of
humor
is
as
alive
as
ever
his
dominating
game
has
slowed
dramatically
yes
good
things
always
do
come
to
an
end
and
the
36yearold
shaquille
oneal
can
see
the
finish
line
to
his
illustrious
nba
career
while
knowing
there
will
be
a
lot
more
to
his
life
than
basketball
ive
made
a
lot
of
friends
i
have
a
lot
of
opportunities
im
going
to
do
a
lot
of
things
said
oneal
who
has
one
year
left
on
his
contract
after
this
one
being
the
educated
guy
that
i
am
i
can
probably
do
whatever
i
want
to
do
the
big
aristotle
has
won
four
nba
championships
and
an
olympic
gold
medal
and
is
an
11time
allstar
the
big
diesel
was
named
to
the
nbas
50th
anniversary
team
at
just
24
years
old
was
the
2000
most
valuable
player
and
is
a
threetime
finals
mvp
the
big
cactus

his
nickname
now
with
the
phoenix
suns

is
also
a
hilarious
quote
machine
who
once
called
himself
quotatious
and
said
our
offense
is
like
the
pythagorean
theorem
there
is
no
answer
his
mouth
also
has
gotten
him
into
trouble
too
all
i
wanted
was
one
championship
back
in
the
day
oneal
said
then
i
won
it
and
i
got
two
and
then
i
got
three
and
then
four
im
happy
when
im
done
ill
have
a
hell
of
a
book
the
final
chapters
are
being
written
now
oneal
who
averaged
a
careerlow
129
points
last
season
has
shown
he
still
can
be
effective
by
averaging
115
points
105
rebounds
and
15
blocks
in
his
first
two
games
this
season
but
foes
are
respectful
not
scared
anymore
when
the
suns
failed
to
advance
to
the
second
round
of
the
playoffs
after
acquiring
oneal
in
a
midseason
deal
he
took
the
blame
over
steve
nash
and
amare
stoudemire
if
we
dont
win
thats
my
fault
oneal
said
i
accept
it
im
harder
on
myself
than
any
of
you
guys
could
ever
be
on
me
thats
why
all
of
you
writers
dont
bother
me
i
accept
that
ive
been
that
way
since
my
rookie
year
if
you
want
to
be
the
man
you
have
to
accept
what
comes
with
being
the
man
you
want
to
be
the
man
and
you
want
to
make
a
lot
of
money
and
you
want
to
be
able
to
do
your
thing
but
when
things
dont
go
right
the
man
gets
blamed
period
with
a
full
suns
training
camp
under
his
belt
and
a
defensiveminded
new
coach
in
terry
porter
oneal
feels
the
suns
will
shine
brightly
especially
since
the
pressure
is
not
on
us
we
have
all
the
keys
oneal
said
we
have
shooters
we
have
defenders
i
know
everybody
is
overlooking
us
once
he
retires
oneal
will
have
countless
opportunities
awaiting
him
in
the
entertainment
world
plus
tnt
and
espn
begging
for
his
straightforward
and
humorous
analysis
and
he
will
be
welcomed
in
his
beloved
field
of
law
enforcement
so
dont
feel
bad
for
shaq
because
with
a
largerthanlife
persona
he
is
too
big
to
ever
be
moved
out
of
the
spotlight
lord
knows
its
going
to
be
a
sad
day
when
i
leave
the
game
he
said
i
know
you

are
going

the

said

after
the

absorbed
their
ninth
straight
loss
its
a
steep
learning
curve
for
a
young
team
number
of
games
sam
cassell
needs
to
reach
1000
for
his
career
new
york

this
is
where
unfulfilled
olympians
come
for
redemption
and
a
gothamsized
consolation
prize
as
bill
rodgers
first
did
in
1976
paula
radcliffe
came
up
lame
in
beijing
and
placed
a
careerworst
23d
catherine
ndereba
thought
she
was
winning
until
she
discovered
that
romanias
constantina
tomescudita
had
run
away
from
the
pack
gete
wami
whod
been
up
with
the
leaders
dropped
out
with
intestinal
miseries
and
kara
goucher
finished
well
out
of
the
medals
in
the
5000
and
10000
meters
on
the
track
so
theyve
all
come
here
for
this
mornings
39th
new
york
city
marathon
which
has
gotten
so
big
39000
runners
that
there
will
be
three
separate
wave
starts
on
the
verrazano
narrows
bridge
the
rewards
as
always
are
worth
the
trip
for
radcliffe
the
defending
champion
its
the
lure
of
a
third
womens
title
which
nobody
has
managed
since
the
legendary
grete
waitz
claimed
nine
between
1978
and
1988
what
grete
did
there
winning
nine
was
amazing
said
the
world
recordholder
who
won
here
in
2004
after
dropping
out
of
the
olympic
race
but
to
even
just
win
new
york
three
times
is
a
big
achievement
and
would
be
to
me
for
ndereba
a
kenyan
who
has
won
four
times
in
boston
and
twice
in
chicago
a
triumph
here
would
complete
the
american
triple
crown
and
possibly
clinch
the
world
marathon
majors
title
it
means
a
lot
said
the
twotime
world
champion
and
twotime
olympic
silver
medalist
who
has
been
runnerup
here
twice
i
dont
even
have
words
to
explain
for
ethiopias
wami
finishing
first
or
second
would
mean
retaining
her
wmm
title
and
collecting
another
500000
payout
and
for
goucher
a
former
miler
wholl
be
making
her
26mile
debut
its
a
long
shot
chance
to
become
the
first
us
woman
to
win
here
since
miki
gorman
in
1977
when
2
hours
43
minutes
was
good
enough
for
a
laurel
wreath
i
hope
i
can
fight
through
the
pain
said
goucher
who
has
never
run
more
than
a
halfmarathon
its
more
like
please
let
me
be
able
to
keep
going
for
2
hours
in
the
absence
of
kenyan
defending
champion
martin
lel
who
broke
his
left
foot
in
the
lisbon
halfmarathon
in
september
the
mens
race
figures
to
be
a
jostle
among
the
three
previous
titlists
brazils
marilson
gomes
dos
santos
kenyas
paul
tergat
and
south
africas
hendrick
ramaala
plus
moroccos
abderrahim
goumri
last
years
runnerup
and
top
domestic
hope
abdi
abdirahman
who
dropped
out
of
the
olympic
trials
here
last
year
if
i
didnt
have
a
chance
of
winning
this
race
or
didnt
believe
i
can
win
the
race
i
wouldnt
come
to
the
race
said
abdirahman
whod
be
the
first
us
male
to
win
since
alberto
salazar
in
1982
the
americans
have
been
creeping
closer
with
meb
keflezighi
placing
second
in
2004
and
third
in
2005
abdirahman
who
was
fifth
in
2005
would
have
a
decent
chance
in
a
tactical
race
the
things
ive
been
doing
the
past
few
months
indicated
that
im
capable
of
running
a
real
fast
time
said
abdirahman
whose
personal
best
is
20856
in
chicago
and
im
ready
the
odds
are
longer
for
goucher
whos
up
against
a
brutal
field
that
also
includes
former
champions
joyce
chepchumba
and
tegla
loroupe
of
kenya
and
ludmila
petrova
of
russia
and
a
couple
of
boston
victors
in
ethiopias
dire
tune
and
kenyas
rita
jeptoo
when
i
look
over
the
field
at
everyones
stats
and
everything
theyve
done
in
the
marathon
its
a
little
bit
overwhelming
acknowledged
goucher
radcliffes
stats
are
the
most
impressive
besides
the
world
mark
21525
set
in
2003
she
has
won
every
marathon
shes
run
outside
of
olympus
and
probably
should
have
skipped
beijing
since
she
was
recovering
from
a
stressfractured
femur
its
the
olympic
games
radcliffe
said
i
wanted
to
go
there
and
give
it
the
best
shot
i
could
ndereba
who
didnt
know
that
tomescudita
already
had
dashed
away
from
the
leaders
when
she
joined
the
pack
thought
she
had
the
gold
medal
until
she
spotted
the
romanian
up
ahead
with
too
little
time
to
catch
her
if
i
win
new
york
she
said
i
just
count
it
as
if
it
was
olympic
gold
the
games
have
come
and
gone
but
theres
still
one
more
piece
of
glittering
fruit
on
the
global
tree
this
year
i
dont
associate
new
york
with
being
a
place
where
i
have
to
go
to
get
over
something
bad
said
radcliffe
but
at
the
same
time
i
do
have
good
feelings
about
the
place
that
yes
when
i
go
there
i
can
race
well
and
something
special
can
happen

halloween
was
over
and
it
looked
like
fright
night
at
alumni
stadium
for
boston
college
in
its
atlantic
coast
conference
showdown
with
clemson
for
the
second
week
in
a
row
the
offense
sputtered
the
defense
suffered
a
few
key
breakdowns
and
the
eagles
looked
doomed
with
another
tough
loss
in
a
game
they
had
to
win
to
remain
legitimate
contenders
for
another
atlantic
division
crown
as
has
been
the
case
in
this
series
the
outcome
wasnt
decided
until
the
final
seconds
which
this
time
worked
out
in
the
tigers
favor
as
they
hung
on
for
a
2721
victory
yesterday
before
a
disappointed
crowd
of
41863
the
tigers
who
absorbed
the
forced
resignation
of
coach
tommy
bowden
two
weeks
ago
came
off
a
bye
week
with
what
looked
like
a
winning
attitude
and
formula
with
running
back
cj

recovered
from
a
hamstring
injury
clemsons

james

by
the
half
clemson
had
a
170
lead
and
had
the
eagles
looking
for
answers
but
with
a
reasonable
sense
of
confidence
coach
bc
defensive
coordinator
frank
spaziani
said
17
points
is
a
scary
lead
said
middle
linebacker
and
cocaptain
mike
mclaughlin
whose
thirdquarter
interception
set
up
bcs
first
td
a
1yard
run
by
josh
haden
that
made
it

the
team
did
a
great
job
of
coming
back
unfortunately
we
came
up
little
short
as
has
been
the
case
throughout
the
season
the
bc
defense
carried
the
burden
and
sparked
the
comeback
which
came
with
a
flourish
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
eagles
drew
to
within
a
field
goal
when
justin
jarvis
blocked
a
clemson
punt
that
was
recovered
by
roderick
rollins
and
returned
25
yards
for
a
td
cutting
clemsons
lead
to
1714
with
1036
remaining
in
the
fourth
quarter
when

wes
davis
intercepted
a
cullen
harper
pass
on
the
tigers
first
play
from

after
the

the

yards

connected
with
brandon
robinson
on

the
eagles
had
the

for
the
first
time
at
2117
with
843
left
but
this
time
neither
destiny
nor
luck
was
on
the

side
spiller

the

kickoff

five
plays
later
clemson
scored
on
a

aaron

and
with
the
extra
point
clemson
was
up

a
year
ago
quarterback
matt
ryan
led
bc
to
a
dramatic
comeback
at
clemson
now
it
was
cranes
turn
with
239
left
in
regulation
the
6foot5inch
senior
took
over
at
his
30
the
words
crane
heard
from
bc
coach
jeff
jagodzinski
were
conflicting
be
aggressive
but
be
careful
i
had
a
conversation
with
the
coach
right
before
i
went
out
there
and
he
said
dont
end
the
game
previous
to
fourth
down
said
crane
who
couldnt
get
a
first
down
on
the
first
three
plays
of
the
series
dont
have
the
game
end
on
a
first
or
seconddown

interception
faced
with

crane
was
forced
out
of
the
pocket
and
threw
a
sideline
pass
to
fullback
james
mccluskey
in
front
of
the
clemson
bench
the
officials
ruled
however
that
mccluskey
was
out
of
bounds
we
just
came
up
short
tonight
said
jagodzinski
give
credit
to
clemson
im
proud
of
my
guys
we
fought
with
everything
we
had
coming
up
short
is
not
good
enough
for
a
team
that
cant
afford
any
more
losses
now
the
eagles
53
23
have
another
test
saturday
against
notre
dame
and
then
they
hit
the
road
for
games
against
florida
state
and
wake
forest
suddenly
the
season
looks
more
ominous
than
encouraging
its
always
disappointing
to
lose
a
game
but
we
need
to
keep
our
heads
up
said
robinson
we
still
have
games
to
win
im
not
even
thinking
about
it
anymore
this
one
is
over
we
didnt
win
and
now
im
focusing

if
villanova
coach
andy
talley
looked
a
little
on
edge
walking
into
parsons
field
yesterday
he
had
his
reasons
a
little
of
it
had
to
do
with
2002
when
villanova
left
northeastern
with
a
3813
loss
some
of
it
had
to
do
with
last
week
when
the
wildcats
shot
at
stunning
no
1
james
madison
ended
on
a
35yard
hail
mary
in
the
final
minute
and
some
of
it
had
to
do
with
northeasterns
record
the
huskies
were
26
coming
into
yesterdays
game
according
to
talley
only
because
they
played
the
toughest
schedule
in
the
colonial
athletic
conference
i
have
been
here
talley
said
i
have
had
my
heart
broken
before
here
so
i
know
what
can
happen
in
this
stadium
seeing
the
huskies
convert
on
fourth
and
8
off
a
fake
punt
did
nothing
to
ease
talleys
jitters
no

villanova
responded
putting
up
20
points
in
a
little
more
than
12
minutes
but
before
the
wildcats
could
leave
with
their
2014
win
the
huskies
made
sure
to
leave
talleys
nerves
a
mess
we
were
scared
of
them
coming
into
the
game
talley
said
it
was
a
big
concern
for
us
i
thought
it
would
be
a
nasty
game
but
i
thought
in
the
end
we
would
have
enough
to
win
thats
what
happened
after
converting
the
fake
punt
the
huskies
27
14
got
a
12yard
halfback
option
pass
for
a
touchdown
from
alex
broomfield
to
brian
mandeville
that
enabled
them
to
stay
within
striking
distance
even
when
villanova
62

ran
off
20
straight
points
villanova
quarterback
chris
whitney
threw
for
161
yards
on
11of16
passing
including
a
54yard
missile
to
brandyn
harvey
that
set
up
a
6yard
touchdown
run
by
aaron
ball
17
carries
91
yards
it
was
the
longest
pass
play
the
huskies
have
allowed
all
season
but
in
the
second
half
nu
found
a
way
to
rattle
whitney
part
of
it
was
defensive
coordinator
rapheal
dowdye
huddling
with
his
players
and
telling
them
to
do
their
job
and
part
of
it
was
finally
figuring
out
the
pace
of
villanovas
option
offense
its
different
said
huskies
linebacker
cornelius
bunch
game
speed
is
definitely
different
than
practice
speed
bunch
studied
whitney
and
realized
that
on
that
deep
ball
as
soon
as
whitney
dropped
back
that
he
was
looking
50
yards
downfield
he
doesnt
look
off
his
receivers
bunch
said
which
explains
the
pass
bunch
picked
off
on
the
eighth
play
of
the
wildcats
first
possession
of
the
second
half
when
whitney
dropped
back
looking
for
angelo
babbaro
i
was
just
watching
his
eyes
bunch
said
anthony
orio
needed
two
passes
to
turn
that
43yard
interception
return
into
a
northeastern
touchdown
hitting
tony
lott
five
catches
62
yards
who
corkscrewed
through
defenders
until
he
reached
the
pylon
for
a
20yard
score
the
wildcats
had
two
chances
to
close
the
door
when
joe
marcoux
missed
a
38yard
field
goal
and
when
whitney
threw
another
interception
this
time
to
jocquez
fears
it
wasnt
until
linebacker
marquis
kirkland
picked
off
a
pass
from
orio
16
of
25
158
yards

td
2
ints
intended
for
chris
plum
that
villanova
was
finally
safe
and
when
he
ran
into
nu
coach
rocky
hager
after
the
game
talley
told
him
as
much
he
felt
like
they
were
pretty
lucky
to
come
out
of
here
with
a
win
hager
said
their
offense
scared
us
a
little
bit
talley
said
theyve
been
running
so
many
different
things
and
special
plays
and
when
youre
26
i
think
youll
try
a
lot
of
different
things
they
do
a
lot
of
things
for
them
to
be
27
right
now
is
a
shame
theyre
an
excellent
team
they
just
have
a
rough
rough
schedule
after
the
game
you
could
measure
hagers
frustration
by
the
number
of
times
he
said
cottonpicking
as
in

inches
from
a
win
we
will
get
over

began
during

second

i

my

was
still

i
try
in
vain
to
recall
the
key
points
in
this

iowa

give
me
a

that
task
is
best
left
to
the
men
and

now
cast
lookalikes
from

of
the

who
have

this

its
a
fools
game
for
the

the

is
behind
the
blather
about
change
and

we
hear
from

absurdities
common
to
all

so

levi

lets
be

here
it
takes
two
to

i
feel
for

he

stays
in

not
this
time
boyo
without

child
then
john
mccain
picked
palin
as
his
vp
and
the
world
as
levi
knew
it
blew
up
in
his
face
he
is
now
a
highschool
dropout
with
a
baby
on
the
way
who
must
live
with
the
certainty
that
images
of
his
newborn
will
end
up
in
people
magazine
whoa
one
day
levi
is
sitting
pretty
in
levi
world
then
abracadabra
levi
is
on
the
tarmac
of
the
minneapolis
airport
meeting
the
mccains
in
the
presence
of
an
alarming
number
of
guys
in
dark
suits
and
shades
whoa
again
he
denies
he
was
dragooned
into
matrimony
but
you
know
this
was
not
his
preferred
route
to
the
altar
next
we
see
levi
in
a
suit
seated

no
cemented

next
to
bristol
at
the
republican
national
convention
a
bizarre
event
on
its
best
day
he
was
clearly
shaken
by
the
tectonic
shift
in
his
life
you
could
see
it
in
his
eyes
throughout
the
week
he
maintained
a
dazed
middistance
stare
that
said
twilight
zone
as
in
this
is
a
bad
dream
right
and
wheres
the
off
button
levi
is
now
burdened
with
a
sentence
of
good
behavior
it
could
be
a
long
one
even
if
mccain
loses
because
mother
palin
has
found
a
comfy
new
home
in
the
limelight
much
as
madonna
did
all
these
many
years
ago
so
levi
think
2012
thats
one
cruel
twist
of
fate
but
look
at
the
bright
side
if
obama
wins
you
can
forget
the
white
house
easter
egg
hunts
another
favorite
of
mine
is
david
axelrod
obamas
top
strategist
who
always
looks
like
he
just
rolled
out
of
bed
on
the
rare
occasions
we
see
him
at
all
you
wonder
how
often
this
guy
changes
his
socks
i
like
him
because
hes
so
unkempt
in
an
army
of
the
kempt
what
ill
take
with
me
from
this
roadshow
is
less
the
fine
print
of
competing
healthcare
plans
than
the
campaign
moments
that
years
from
now
will
stick
for
their
transcendent
oddity
think
of
a
posse
moving
through
saks
and
neiman
like
a
bradley
fighting
vehicle
for
150000
in
glad
rags
and
makeup
for
palin
think
obama
running
mate
joe
biden
he
of
the
heralded
open
mouth
change
feet
approach
to
rhetoric
who
said
that
fdr
talked
to
america
during
the
great
depression
on
television
some
years
before
the
dreadful
thing
was
invented
think
too
of
the
young
man
in
a
red
parka
atop
a
snowdrift
near
manchester
nh
festooned
with
hillary
signs
on
a
january
day
that
reached
three
degrees
above
zero
his
outstretched
arms
appeared
frozen
at
915
i
said
to
myself
at
the
time
whatever
theyre
not
paying
him
its
not
enough
but
then
dennis
kucinich
volunteers
held
signs
the
same
day
in
shorts
ill
remember
ralph
nader
the
savant
who
told
us
in
2000
there
was
no
difference
between
al
gore
and
george
bush
the
loon
is
now
reduced
to
setting
records
for
the
most
stump
speeches
in
one
day
across
massachusetts
for
the
guinness
book
of
records
this
makes
me
think
of
anthony
quinn
at
the
tragic
end
of
requiem
for
a
heavyweight
except
theres
nothing
tragic
about
nader
ill
remember
the
balloon
drops
at
the
conventions
this
year
because
they
shattered
the
balloon
status
quo
it
has
been
a
law
of
political
physics
since
the
enlightenment
that
republicans
do
better
balloon
drops
than
democrats
they
just
do
but
in
a
portentous
change
this
summer
denver
outdropped
minneapolis
ill
remember
bill
clintons
boffo
speech
in
praise
of
obama
in
denver
because
he
didnt
mean
a
word
he
said
no
wonder
obama
passed
on
hillary
for
vp
can
you
imagine
bubba
and
her
ensconced
up
in
the
naval
observatory
residence
of
the
vice
president
hatching
schemes
for
a
palace
coup
far
into
the
night
ill
remember
obamas
emotional
remove
which
has
made
him
the
most
intriguing
american
politician
in
memory
and
ill
remember
the
third
presidential
debate
when
i
saw
the
bile
in
john
mccain
his
eyes
aglitter
and
his
mouth
locked
in
a
fake
smile
i
hadnt
seen
since
his
early
appearances
on
cnns
crossfire
as
i
load
up
on
doritos
and
licorice
for
election
night
i
remind
myself
were
not
supposed
to
analyze
these
campaigns
what
were
supposed
to
analyze
are
the
emotions
they
generate

at

south

resident
conrad
cochran
waited
in
line
to
cast
his
very
first
vote
for
william
l
dawson
a
groundbreaking
africanamerican
politician
from
the
neighborhood
who
was
running
for
congress
fortyfive
years
later
cochran
stood
for
more
than
an
hour
to
vote
for
another
exceptional
politician
who
called
the
south

home
harold
washington
chicagos
first
black
mayor
in

now
at

89
cochran
can
barely
stand
at
all
the
walker
he
needs
to
get
around
has
a
builtin
seat
on
thursday
however
the
retired
postal
worker
was
as
excited
as
anyone
inside
bronzevilles
martin
luther
king
jr
community
center
to
vote
for
barack
obama
a
transplanted
son
of
the
south
side
and
it
didnt
matter
that
he
had
to
wait
in
a
threehourlong
line
to
do
it
ive
never
seen
nothing
like
this
said
cochran
who
because
of
his
age
was
escorted
to
the
head
of
the
line
by
poll
workers
it
means
change
thats
been
long
in
coming
and
now
its
finally
happening
he
said
the
change
cochran
referred
to
isnt
from
one
administration
to
another
or
from
one
set
of
policies
to
another
its
a
deeper
change
that
has
allowed
chicagos
large
africanamerican
community

the
incubator
of
many
black
leaders

to
become
for
this
moment
at
least
the
center
of
all
american
politics
obama
ran
for
the
us
senate
from
chicago
and
he
still
lives
on
the
south
side
the
neighborhood
has
been
home
to
some
of
the
most
significant
black
political
figures
in
american
history
including
dawson
a
powerful
congressman
who
served
more
than
30
years
civil
rights
activist
jesse
jackson
creator
of
the
pushrainbow
coalition
and
a
twotime
presidential
candidate
and
carol
moseley
braun
who
in
1996
became
the
first
black
woman
to
win
election
to
the
us
senate
only
harlem
might
have
been
stronger
in
producing
black
political
leaders
of
national
prominence
said
michael
dawson
a

science
professor
at
the
university
of
chicago
and
a
relative
of
dawson
who
won
his
congressional
seat

the
citys
south
side
michael
dawson
said
developed
black
politicians
at
a
level
no
other
state
has
seen
for
decades
chicago
has
occupied
a
unique
place
in
africanamerican
history
and
a
high
number
of
nationallyknown
black
entrepreneurs
got
their
start
here
from
ebony

john

to

black
chicagoans
such
as
jackson
and

leader
louis
farrakhan
both
with
strong

that
influenced
the
national

springboard
that
propelled
obamas

rise
to
the
doorstep
of
the
white
house
however
was
established
on
the
south
side
decades
before
his
birth
in
hawaii
historians
note
that
beginning
in
the
early
1900s
that
area
of
chicago
became
a
destination
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
former
slaves
and
their
descendants
who
moved
to
the
midwest
fleeing
jim
crow
oppression
and
the
grinding
handtomouth
poverty
of
the
postwar
south
lured
by
the
prospect
of
good
jobs
and
a
more
tolerant
racial
climate
many
of
them
boarded
trains
hitched
rides
or
traveled
however
they
could
following
a
northbound
path
that
traced
the

river
stephanie
davenport
director
of
educational
programs
at
chicagos
dusable
museum
of
african
american
history
said
the
migrants
found
racial
hostility
and
segregation
along
with
jobs
in
chicagos
factories
and
foundries
most
of
the
migrants
she
said
didnt
have
much
money
and
settled
on
the
south
side
which
had
plenty
of
cheap
substandard
housing
but
the
hard
times
helped
forge
a
strong
sense
of
community
and
selfsufficiency
she
said
segregation
gave
rise
to
the
citys
first
africanamerican
doctors
dentists
and
attorneys
which
in
turn
helped
create
the
citys
upwardlymobile
black
middle
class
as
community
leaders
began
to
demand
better
working
and
living
conditions
davenport
said
that
meant
you
had
to
go
against
the
political
system
and
learn
how
it
worked
gradually
south
side
businesspeople
community
activists
and
aspiring
politicians
began
to
realize
their
collective
power
white
politicians
could
see
that
there
were
lots
of
votes
here
inspiring
transracial
coalitions
davenport
said
you
had
all
of
this
coming
together
she
said
and
it
found
a
home
on
the
south
side
toni
preckwinkle
a
longtime
alderman
who
represents
the
hyde
park
neighborhood
in
the
south
side
said
the
area
has
always
had
an
interesting
relationship
with
national
politics
starting
with
arthur
mitchell
who
was
elected
to
congress
in
the
1930s
dawson
she
said
was
widely
regarded
as
a
kingmaker
for
judges
and
upandcoming
politicians

black
and
white

during
his
tenure
on
capitol
hill
the
person
democrats
looked
to
for
recommendations
the
south
side
has
produced
the
preeminent
africanamerican
politicians
in
the
country
said
preckwinkle
who
was
an
early
mentor
to
obama
when
he
moved
to
the
area
as
a
community
organizer
in
the
1990s
david
axelrod
obamas
chief
political
strategist
and
a
former
chicago
tribune
political
writer
was
working
for
the
newspaper
when
washington
ran
for
mayor
in
a
very
very
ugly
election
that
broke
sharply
along
racial
lines
but
obama
carried
nearly
all
of
the
city
during
the
illinois
primary

including
the
ones
washington
lost
though
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
other
young
aspiring
black
politicians
follow
obamas
model
and
come
to
the
south
side
to
establish
themselves
the
signs
for
the
future
are
good
he
said
we
already
elected
two
africanamerican
united
states
senators
weve
made
tremendous
progress
in
illinois
in
breaking
down
some
of
these
old
barriers
said
axelrod
pausing
between
campaign
events
in
florida
during
the
last
week
of
the
presidential
race
i
dont
know
if
it
makes
it
the
hub
of
black
politics
hopefully
if
we
are
successful

and
even
if
were
not

at
this
point
its
fair
to
say
that
obama
has
helped
shatter
some
old
shibboleths
and
myths
and
barriers
and
i
think
that
will
be
important
he
said
but
hes
not
running
to
be
the
leader
of
the
black
community
axelrod
said
hes
running
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
scott
helman
of
the
globe
staff

who
is
traveling
with
the
obama
campaign
contributed
to
this
report
while
barack
obama
enters
the
final
days
of
the
presidential
campaign
with
a
clear
lead
in
the
polls

but
not
so
big
as
to
rule
out
a
surprise
victory
for
john
mccain

the
impact
of
the
2008
presidential
campaign
will
depend
not
only
on
who
wins
but
also
on
whether
the
results
signify
a
deeper
realignment
in
american
politics
we
like
to
tell
the
election
story
through
the
candidates
said
thomas
patterson
a
professor
at
harvards
john
f
kennedy
school
of
government
but
this
time
there
are
larger
forces
in
play
and
while
obamas
lead
between
three
and
seven
percentage
points
in
most
national
polls
is
big
enough
to
make
him
the
favorite
going
into
tuesday
the
other
big
questions
of
the
election
are
all
too
close
to
call
is
the
reagan
revolution
over
going
down
the
stretch
mccain
is
campaigning
heavily
on
obamas
comment
that
he
wants
to
spread
the
wealth
and
mccain
has
even
discovered
a
sevenyearold
radio
interview
suggesting
that
obama
may
believe
in
redistributive
economics
during
the
heyday
of
the
democrats
new
deal
coalition
which
dominated
politics
from
1932
until
1980
the
idea
of
spreading
the
wealth
around
was
hardly
political
poison

it
was
the
backbone
of
the
partys
economic
philosophy
since
1980
and
the
reagan
revolution
however
using
tax
policies
to
redistribute
income
has
been
widely
viewed
as
an
outmoded
approach
that
chokes
off
economic
growth
obama
hasnt
fully
embraced
60sstyle
taxandspend
liberalism
but
he
hasnt
run
away
from
it
as
much
as
other
democratic
presidential
nominees
since
1984
have
done
bill
clinton
the
most
successful
democratic
votegetter
of
that
period
went
out
of
his
way
to
declare
that
the
era
of
big
government
is
over
and
assure
voters
that
he
is
a
progrowth
democrat
who
favors
third
way
policies
obama
also
touts
his
policies
as
progrowth
but
has
emphasized
that
he
believes
people
earning
more
than
250000
should
bear
the
brunt
of
tax
increases
to
cover
social
initiatives
that
would
disproportionately
benefit
lowerincome
people
to
the
extent
that
such
a
mechanism
spreads
the
wealth
hes
in
favor
of
it
many
observers
have
noted
that
americans
want
more
economic
security
in
their
lives
including
guaranteed
healthcare
pensions
disaster
relief
and
improvements
to
public
infrastructure
and
the
mccain
campaign
in
a
break
with
ronald
reagans
creed
of
smaller
government
has
called
for
the
government
to
pay
up
to
300
billion
to
buy
up
home
mortgages
and
chop
the
monthly
payments
to
reflect
diminished
home
values
in
addition
the
mccain
proposal
that
follows
the
reagan
creed
most
closely

his
call
for
extending
the
bush
tax
cuts
and
adding
new
cuts
of
business
taxes

seems
to
be
falling
on
deaf
ears
in
recent
weeks
the
gop
nominee
has
concentrated
more
on
warning
of
tax
hikes
under
obama
than
touting
the
benefits
of
his
own
taxcut
plan
david
brooks
the
conservative
new
york
times
columnist
has
predicted
that
the
economic
uncertainty
will
lead
to
a
democratic
sweep
followed
by
an
intensive
return
to
taxandspend
liberalism
what
were
going
to
see
in
short
is
the
gingrich
revolution
in
reverse
and
on
steroids
brooks
wrote
last
month
mccain
believes
that
voters
still
fear
the
kind
of
overreach
that
brooks
predicts
a
modest
victory
for
obama
could
easily
be
ascribed
to
a
simple
desire
for
a
change
benefiting
a
candidate
who
tried
to
present
his
policies
in
modest
terms
a
big
obama
win
however
could
be
read
as
a
mandate
for
just
the
kind
of
liberalism
that
brooks
fears
and
it
could
signal
a
much
longerterm
political
realignment
the
new
deal
era
and
the
reagan
revolution
each
followed
failed
presidencies
that
fairly
or
not
are
still
invoked
as
cautionary
tales

the
herbert
hoover
and
jimmy
carter
administrations
george
w
bushs
administration
with
recordlow
approval
ratings
may
join
the
list
is
america
prepared
to
move
beyond
its
racial
divisions
on
the
day
of
obamas
democratic
nomination
acceptance
speech
tens
of
thousands
of
africanamericans
most
with
children
in
tow
waited
for
hours
in
security
lines
to
enter
denvers
football
stadium
to
celebrate
the
crowning
of
the
nations
first
black
presidential
nominee
despite
the
football
setting
it
was
more
of
a
church
crowd

uplifted
generous
and
full
of
faith
while
some
black
voters
would
express
concerns
for
obamas
safety
and
nervousness
about
his
campaign
many
others
have
remained
quietly
confident
even
when
polls
narrowed
and
other
democrats
worried
that
obama
wasnt
as
far
ahead
as
he
should
be
given
the
countrys
problems
much
of
black
voters
faith
is
in
obama
himself
but
there
is
also
a
quiet
recognition
among
many
that
whatever
the
extent
of
racial
divisions
they
dont
preclude
a
majoritywhite
country
from
electing
a
black
president
that
by
itself
could
change
racial
pathologies
that
have
existed
throughout
american
history
since
george
washington
the
president
has
been
the
symbol
of
the
nation
as
much
as
european
monarchs
once
embodied
their
nations
identity
having
a
black
president
just
four
decades
after
the
end
of
legal
segregation
would
force
a
reconsideration
of
almost
all
assumptions
about
race
relations
in
america
but
if
obama
were
to
lose

and
if
white
resistance
to
a
black
nominee
were
cited
as
a
major
factor

black
hopes
would
be
dashed
in
a
way
that
could
increase
racial
tensions
at
least
in
the
short
term
still
the
legacy
of
the
obama
campaign
win
or
lose
on
race
relations
probably
wont
be
clear
until
long
after
tuesday
are
young
people
becoming
a
driving
force
in
american
politics
back
in
the
60s
the
emerging
baby
boom
generation
pushed
american
politics
leftward
but
through
the
80s
and
90s
voters
under
30
seesawed
between
backing
democrats
and
republicans
while
turning
out
in
smaller
numbers
overall
their
strongest
sentiment
seemed
to
be
their
indifference
in
the
2000
race
between
al
gore
and
george
w
bush
only
40
percent
of
registered
voters
from
ages
18
to
29
bothered
to
vote
compared
with
65
percent
of
voters
over
30
according
to
a
survey
by
the
nonpartisan
pew
research
center
in
2004
the
turnout
of
voters
under
30
jumped
by
nine
percentage
points
to
49
percent
while
that
of
older
voters
increased
by
only
three
and
those
younger
voters
supported
democrat
john
kerry
over
bush
by
a
sevenpoint
margin
48
to
41
percent
this
year
voters
between
18
and
29
are
backing
obama
by
a
whopping
29
points

61
to
32
according
to
a
pew
survey
and
while
more
young
voters
showed
up
for
this
years
democratic
primaries
than
in
2004
no
one
is
sure
whether
turnout
of
young
voters
will
take
another
big
leap
in
the
general
election
were
expecting
them
to
at
least
match
their
turnout
level
of
2004
if
not
increase
it
said
scott
keeter
pews
director
of
survey
research
given
the
enormous
lead
obama
has
among
young
voters
theyll
be
a
key
to
whether
he
wins
or
not
how
much
do
americans
care
about
their
image
in
the
world
arguably
the
opinions
of
foreigners
have
never
counted
for
anything
in
us
politics
some
of
the
most
unpopular
american
presidents
in
the
outside
world

such
as
reagan

were
hugely
popular
at
home
while
those
most
concerned
with
the
world

like
hoover
and
carter

were
domestic
flops
but
the
latest
plunge
in
americas
standing
in
the
world
spurred
by
the
policies
of
the
bush
administration
has
gotten
some
political
attention
at
home
especially
when
linked
to
the
administrations
failure
to
persuade
enough
allies
to
share
the
costs
of
intervention
in
iraq
obama
has
cited
his
own
racial
background
and
time
spent
in
indonesia
as
a
reason
why
the
world
will
look
at
america
differently
when
im
president
that
argument
drew
voters
to
obama
during
his
primary
race
against
hillary
clinton
and
he
reinforced
just
how
much
his
election
could
do
to
improve
relations
with
us
allies
by
staging
a
campaignstyle
rally
in
berlin
attended
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
adoring
germans
elsewhere
in
the
world
from
europe
to
asia
there
has
been
intense
scrutiny
of
the
american
election

and
excitement
over
the
obama
campaign
the
global
interest
suggests
that
millions
of
foreigners
might
be
prepared
to
change
their
opinions
of
the
united
states
under
a
president
obama
but
in
recent
weeks
foreign
policy
has
taken
a
back
seat
in
the
election
so
it
will
be
hard
to
judge
how
much
an
obama
victory
would
be
a
mandate
to
be
more
attentive
to
us
allies
and
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
a
president
obama
would
be
able
to
meet
the
high
expectations
that
american
allies
seem
to
have
for
him
what
does
it
mean
to
be
a
conservative
the
republican
coalition
has
been
compared
to
a
stool
with
three
legs

strong
national
defense
low
taxes
and
conservative
social
values
its
never
been
a
secret
that
many
republicans
buy
into
only
one
or
another
of
the
three
legs
but
theyve
bought
in
strongly
enough
that
their
disagreements
with
the
others
havent
mattered
recently
though
the
stool
has
been
wobbling
back
in
easter
of
2005
the
president
and
both
houses
of
congress
rushed
back
to
washington
to
intervene
in
the
case
of
terri
schiavo
a
braindamaged
woman
whose
husband
had
chosen
to
remove
her
from
a
respirator
polls
showed
vast
majorities
of
americans
opposed
to
government
intervention
but
bush
and
gop
congressional
leaders
pushed
legislation
through
anyway
that
weekend
was
a
triumph
for
abortion
foes
but
may
have
driven
other
republicans
away
likewise
the
unexpected
toll
in
iraq
has
sparked
concerns
among
evangelicals
and
the
recent
wall
street
meltdown
has
made
many
middleclass
republicans
question
their
partys
economic
policies
mccain
is
mostly
aligned
with
the
defense
wing
but
also
has
credibility
as
a
budget
cutter
he
has
tried
to
hold
together
all
three
conservative
constituencies
even
wooing
social
conservatives

who
have
long
resisted
him

with
his
pick
of
alaska
governor
sarah
palin
as
his
vice
presidential
nominee
still
his
presidency
compared
with
bushs
would
probably
reduce
the
impact
of
the
religious
right
and
if
mccain
is
defeated
the
three
branches
of
the
gop
will
have
to
decide
whether
to
hang
together

or
go
their
own
ways
they
may
choose
to
dampen
down
the
role
of
social
conservatives
a
bit
like
the
democrats
after
the
80s
really
pushed
down
as
much
as
they
could
on
the
africanamerican
agenda
says
patterson
but
in
the
short
term
he
said
much
will
depend
on
events
outside
the
partys
control
like
the
economy
if
the
economys
weak
theyll
gain
seats
in
congress
in
two
years
assuming
that
democrats
as
expected
maintain
control
of
the
house
and
the
senate
patterson
said
theyll
declare
that
the
partys
back
but
in
what
form
will
remain
to
be
seen

broke

finance
laws
but
last
week
the
senate
passed
a
resolution
calling
on
her
to
resign
this
time
there
was
no

just
anger

broke
wilkerson
vowed
to
continue

held
for
15
years
she
hoped
that
black

would
also

to

then
a

down
when
a

loses
the

its

on

humiliating

because
of

it

suddenly
in

the

that
kind
of

not

embraced
in

obama
has
presented
a

for
change

unify

not

said
williams
of

we

may
be
archaic

he
said
the

that

people
need
to
employ

is
extinct
to
coin

phrase

as
the
fierce
urgency
of
now
propels
obama
closer
to
the
white
house
it
squeezes
wilkerson
out
of
the
massachusetts
state
house
once
she
was
the
reformer
and
symbol
of
a

the

in

needs
a
break
in
the
final
days
of
the

race
john

is
forcefully
arguing
that

is
a
liberal
taxandspender

even
a
marxist
he
says

to

perhaps
in

not
as

as
he

ohio
river
where
morning
sunshine

on
the
late

last

communities
are
still
struggling
to
reinvent
themselves
a
generation
after
the
collapse
of
the
steel
industry
here
voters
tend
to
be
rightleaning
on
social
issues
and
uncomfortable
with
the
idea
of
increasing
taxes
on
anybody
even
the
wealthy
but
they
also
remember
the
days
when
their
towns
had
a
stronger
middle
class
when
good
jobs
were
plentiful
and
it
wasnt
hard
for
a
steelworker
with
a
high
school
education
to
own
a
nice
house
and
a
second
car
such
jobs
are
much
harder
to
find
now
in
rochester
in
the
last
year
a
sluggish
economy
has
hurt
businesses
and
slowed
construction
and
the
cost
of
everything
has
gone
up
said
joe

38yearold
selfemployed
contractor
from

monaca
who
remembers
the
days
when
his

could
walk
out

find
another
job
at
the
next
mill
down
the
street
standing
downtown
the

surrounded
by
abandoned
storefronts
filled

kaminsky

army
to
see
about
getting
some
assistance
during

for
his

of
seven
the
way
voters
like
kaminsky
see
it
wealth
has
already
flowed
away
from
the
poor
and
the
middle
class
toward
the
rich
and
some
corrective
action
is
in

i
think
people
are
fed
up
with
the
republican
point
of
view

the
rich
get
the
breaks
and
we
get
the
shaft
said
kaminsky
a
democrat
who
supports
obama
even
some
hardcore
republicans
who
planned
to
vote
for
mccain
dismissed
his
argument
that
obama
is
a
socialist
pointing
out
that
many
republicans
voted
for
the
700

bailout
package
you
want

the

once
believed
in

was

it
seemed
to
work
he
said
but
a
bank
president
wasnt
making
25
million
back
then
either
still
there
remains
a
deep
distrust
of
big
government
programs
here
and
strong
skepticism
about
obama
a
number
of
voters
feared
he
would
transfer
wealth
from
the
middle
class
to
help
people
who
dont

who
dont

voters
believe

would

would
help
the

the
concept
of
wealth
redistribution
is
as
unpopular
here
as
it
is
in
most
of
america
borick
said
and
the
notion
may
play
on
racist
fears
of
black
welfare
recipients
siphoning
money
from
workingclass
whites

fears
that
have
special
resonance
since
obama
is
black

your

is
your
immediate
financial

not

going

youre
more
worried

this
does
not
mean
he
said
that
western

would

comfortable
with
a

fully
embraced

voters

be

hrelec

he
wasnt

far
to

he
tried
to

but
he
didnt
punish
the

people
either

be
sure
there
are
voters
here

whom
principle
trumps
economic
selfinterest

who
would

the

has

had
a
significant

the

a
virtue
and
not
just
for
people
who
like
to
read
in

at
the
same
time
this
period
saw
a
remarkable
transformation
there
were
only
18
states
in
1815
but
30
by
1848
florida
texas
and
vast
stretches
of
the
northwest
and
southwest
were
added
to
the
national
territory
the
population
of
the
united
states
increased
to
nearly
23
million
from
8
million
and
that
population
became
much
more
diverse
as
immigrants
began
to
pour
in
from
europe
and
spread
out
across
the
continent
with
increasing
speed
americans
were
a
remarkably
bumptious
selfconfident
ambitious
and
materialistic
group
the
englishwoman
frances
trollope
mother
of
the
novelist
anthony
trollope
reported
a
resident
englishman
telling
her
that
he
had
never
overheard
americans
conversing
without
the
word
dollar
being
pronounced
between
them
and
yet
the
country
was
also
in
the
midst
of
a
major
religious
revival
often
called
the
second
great
awakening
this
was
the
period
when
joseph
smith
was
founding
the
mormons
and
william
miller
the
adventists
when
revival
meetings
were
sometimes
attended
by
tens
of
thousands
economically
the
country
became
much
richer
and
much
more
diverse
as
industry
developed
in
the
north
cotton
spread
through
the
lower
south
and
the
midwest
turned
into
one
of
the
worlds
great
grainproducing
areas
transportation
improved
radically
as
roads
canals
and
then
after
1830
railroads
began
to
connect
the
various
parts
of
an
immense
country
and
to
weld
it
into
a
single
continentwide
market
the
erie
canal
was
by
far
the
most
important
of
these
new
avenues
for
it
linked
the
fertile
soils
of
the
midwest
directly
to
the
east
coast
the
produce
that
once
had
to
flow
down
the
mississippi
began
increasingly
to
flow
through
the
canal
to
new
york
city
which
became
the
greatest
boom
town
the
world
had
ever
known
curiously
three
men
who
never
became
president
although
they
wanted
the
office

henry
clay
daniel
webster
and
john
c
calhoun

are
more
familiar
to
most
americans
than
many
of
the
men
who
did
reach
the
white
house
but
one
president
dominated
the
era
to
the
extent
that
he
gave
his
name
to
the
age
and
received
the
ultimate
historical
accolade
of
having
that
name
turned
into
an
adjective
to
describe
his
times
and
policies
that
of
course
was
andrew
jackson
he
was
the
first
president
to
be
born
poor
the
first
not
to
come
from
virginia
or
massachusetts
he
shaped
the
future
of
american
politics
so
profoundly
that
the
great
19thcentury
historian
george
bancroft
thought
him
the
last
of
the
founding
fathers
it
was
in
jacksons
time
that
property
qualifications
for
voting
were
largely
abolished
and
what
we
would
recognize
as
democracy
at
least
for
white
men
took
firm
hold
the
modern
twoparty
system
evolved
in
this
period
as
well
as
jackson
became
the
father
of
the
presentday
democratic
party
and
in
the
1850s
the
antijackson
whigs
would
give
way
to
the
republicans
reynolds
brings
this
remarkable
man
to
life
after
an
attempted
assassination
misfired
reynolds
reports
jackson
once
said
he
never
felt
frightened
in
any
situation
and
he
certainly
was
not
now
he
lifted
his
cane
and
charged
his
assailant
dropping
the
pistol
the
man
pulled
out
another
aimed
and
fired
again
the
gun
failed
others
wrestled
the
gunman
to
the
ground
jackson
calmly
continued
his
day
remarking
that
he
was
not
born
to
be
shot
by
an
assassin
reynolds
book
is
necessarily
a
tour
dhorizon
of
the
period
and
he
describes
it
thoroughly
in
a
manageable
amount
of
space
given
the
vast
size
of
the
subject
the
number
of
people
to
be
discussed
and
the
number
of
topics
to
be
covered
to
give
a
sense
of
this
period
that
is
no
small
accomplishment
to
achieve
his
goal
reynolds
deviates
from
a
strictly
chronological
approach
instead
he
covers
many
major
subjects
like
the
religious
revival
separately
he
has
a
chapter
on
the
literary
and
artistic
accomplishments
of
the
time
when
the
country
began
forging
a
separate
identity
in
the
arts
edgar

reynolds

so
much
with

economy
that

sometimes
get
the
feeling
the
book
was
written
on
index
cards
but
waking

her

with

sold
she

island
def
jam
leaving
her
independent
so
there
was
an
extra
edge
during

madison

saturday
when
she
shouted
at
the
end
of
her
song
control
im
on
my
own
and
ill
call
my
own
shots
her
first
tour
in
seven
years
started
shakily
this
fall
with
shows
suddenly
canceled
or
postponed
her
spokesman
said
that
jackson
42
suffered
from
vestibular
migraines
that
could
cause
dizziness

problem

who
in

is
more
a

dropped
off

yet
none
of
that
weighed
down
jacksons
garden
show
which
had
been
postponed
from
oct
16
she
strutted
through
a
fulltilt
arena
spectacle
like
those
she
has
mounted
since
her
multimillionselling
days
in
the
1980s
and
90s
with
dancers
video
screens
pyrotechnics
and
lipsynching
how
much
jackson
was
actually
singing
during
the
concert
is
open
to
conjecture
except
for
stage
patter
her
voice
was
rarely
fully
exposed
as
she
shared
lead
vocals
with
recorded
tracks
but
the
foundation
for
all
that
razzledazzle
was
one
of
the
most
durable
catalogs
of
hits
from
the
musicvideo
era
and
plenty
of
them
jacksons
set
list
had
three
dozen
songs
and
all
but
the
oldest
and
most
recent
ones
triggered
immediate
singalongs
her
constant
subject
is
longing
for
sex
both
tender
and
kinky
but
also
for
companionship
and
devotion
to
pack
all
those
songs
into
just
over
two
hours
onstage
she
turned
them
into
medleys
grouped
by
musical
style
there
were
minisets
of
keyboarddriven
funk
like
nasty
of

suspended
in
a
leather
harness
above
a
supine

who
groped
between
his
legs
in

closeups
at
the
end
he
babbled
about
his
love
for
jackson
into
a
convenient

jackson
also
reclaimed
the
pop
she
made
as
a
teenager
before
she
became
her
own
producer
with
a
medley
from
her
1982
debut

now
they
sound
like
the
beginning
of
a
style
that
would
merge
her

michael

with
the

but
in

their
artificial

old

still
gleam
an
article
of
faith
among
conservative
critics
of
american
universities
has
been
that
liberal
professors
politically
indoctrinate
their
students
this
conviction
not
only
fueled
the
culture
wars
but
has
also
led
state
lawmakers
to
consider
requiring
colleges
to
submit
reports
to
the
government
detailing
their
progress
in
ensuring
intellectual
diversity
prompted
universities
to
establish
faculty
positions
devoted
to
conservatism
and
spurred
the
creation
of
a
network
of
volunteer
watchdogs
to
monitor
political
correctness
on
campuses
just
a
few
weeks
ago
michael
barone
a
fellow
at
the
conservative
american
enterprise
institute
warned
in
the
washington
times
against
the
liberal
thugocracy
arguing
that
todays
liberals
seem
to
be
taking
marching
orders
from
college
and
university
campuses
but
a
handful
of
new
studies
have
found
such
worries
to
be
overwrought
three
sets
of
researchers
recently
concluded
that
professors
have
virtually
no
impact
on
the
political
views
and
ideology
of
their
students
if
there
has
been
a
conspiracy
among
liberal
faculty
members
to
influence
students
theyve
done
a
pretty
bad
job
said
a
lee
fritschler
a
professor
of
public
policy
at
george
mason
university
and
an
author
of
the
new
book
closed
minds
politics
and
ideology
in
american
universities
brookings
institution
press
the
notion
that
students
are
induced
to
move
leftward
is
a
fantasy
said
jeremy
d
mayer
another
of
the
books
authors
when
it
comes
to
shaping
a
young
persons
political
views
it
is
really
hard
to
change
the
mind
of
anyone
over
15
said
mayer
who
did
extensive
research
on
faculty
and
students
parents
and
family
are
the
most
important
influence
followed
by
the
news
media
and
peers
he
said
professors
are
among
the
least
influential
a
study
of
nearly
7000
students
at
38
institutions
published
in
the
current
ps
political
science
and
politics
the
journal
of
the
american
political
science
association
as
well
as
a
second
study
that
has
been
accepted
by
the
journal
to
run
in
april
2009
both
reach
similar
conclusions
there
is
no
evidence
that
an
instructors
views
instigate
political
change
among
students
matthew
woessner
and
april
kellywoessner
a
husbandandwife
team
of
political
scientists
who
have
frequently
conducted
research
on
politics
in
higher
education
write
in
that
second
study
their
work
is
often
cited
by
people
on
both
sides
of
the
debate
not
least
because
woessner
describes
himself
as
politically
conservative
no
one
disputes
that
american
academia
is
decidedly
more
liberal
than
the
rest
of
the
population
or
that
there
is
a
detectable
shift
to
the
left
among
students
during
their
college
years
still
both
studies
in
the
peerreviewed
ps
for
example
found
that
changes
in
political
ideology
could
not
be
attributed
to
proselytizing
professors
but
rather
to
general
trends
among
that
age
group
as
mack
d
mariani
at
xavier
university
and
gordon
j
hewitt
at
hamilton
college
write
in
the
current
issue
student
political
orientation
does
not
change
for
a
majority
of
students
while
in
college
and
for
those
that
do
change
there
is
evidence
that
other
factors
have
an
effect
on
that
change
such
as
gender
and
socioeconomic
status
that
may
be
said
daniel
klein
an
economist
at
george
mason
but
those
results
dont
necessarily
mean
there
isnt
a
problem
klein
whose
research
has
shown
that
registered
democrats
vastly
outnumber
republicans
among
faculty
in
the
humanities
and
social
sciences
at
american
colleges
and
universities
maintains
that
the
focus
on
the
liberalconservative
split
is
misdirected
such
terms
are
vague
and
can
be
used
to
describe
everything
from
attitudes
about
religion
and
family
to
the
arts
and
lifestyles
he
said
the
real
issue
said
klein
who
calls
himself
a
libertarian
is
that
social
democratic
ideas
dominate
universities

ideas
that
play
down
the
importance
of
the
individual
and
promote
government
intervention
such
academic
groupthink
means
that
the
works
of
such
thinkers
are
not
offered
enough
he
argues
a
major
tragedy
is
that
theyre
not
getting
exposed
to
the
good
stuff
he
said
citing
the
works
of
john
stuart
mill
adam
smith
friedrich
hayek
and
milton
friedman
even
if
we
had
hard
definite
evidence
that
students
werent
influenced
by
their
professors
there
is
still
reason
for
great
concern
about
the
composition
of
the
faculty
klein
added
kc
johnson
a
historian
at
the
city
university
of
new
york
characterizes
the
problem
as
pedagogical
not
political
entire
fields
of
study
from
traditional
literary
analysis
to
political
and
military
history
are
simply
not
widely
taught
anymore
johnson
contended
even
students
who
want
to
learn
dont
have
the
opportunity
because
there
are
no
specialists
on
the
faculty
to
take
courses
from
the
conservative
critics
are
inventing
a
straw
man
that
doesnt
exist
and
are
missing
the
real
problem
that
does
he
added
anne
neal
the
president
of
the
american
council
of
trustees
and
alumni
which
closely
follows
this
issue
agrees
that
it
is
not
about
left
and
right
many
researchers
and
critics
also
agree
that
a
better
grounding
in
american
history
and
politics
is
important
it
wasnt
too
long
ago
that
schools
and
universities
required
civic
education
and
american
history
fritschler
noted
almost
all
of
those
requirements
have
evaporated
a
number
of
organizations
that
have
a
large
base
of
conservative
supporters
like
neals
council
and
the
national
association
of
scholars
have
been
promoting
a
return
to
traditional
courses
in
western
civilization
and
american
history
fritschler
said
that
perhaps
the
most
insidious
side
effect
of
assumptions
about
liberal
influence
has
been
an
overall
disengagement
on
campus
from
civic
and
political
affairs
and
a
reluctance
to
promote
serious
debate
of
political
issues
if
anything
he
added
the
problem
is
not
too
much
politics
but
too
little
that

make
me

keith

i

that
you
could
do
better
than
me
maybe
had
he
recorded
this
song
five
or
so
years
ago
that
maybe
would
have
been
a
winking
taunt
an
acknowledgment
that
he
was
getting
away
with
something
but
here
on
keiths
12th
studio
album
that
dont
make
me
a
bad
guy
its
a
note
of
resignation
its
too
late
he
continues
you
already
love
me
nothing
to
be
done
now
for
years
keith
has
been
reliably
blustery
but
today
his
chest
is
no
longer
puffed
this
album
continues
a
genteel
streak
that
hes
been
cultivating
lately
perhaps
as
a
corrective
to
his
public
persona
of
swagger
and
jingoism
this
is
gentleman
country
and
whats
surprising
is
how
natural
it
sounds
while
these
vocals
lack
his
characteristic
robustness
his
gift
for
melody
is
intact
and
shockingly
his
heart
is
wide
open

a

still
the

his

lack

qtip
the
last
time
qtip
put
out
an
album
he
was
kickstarting
a
solo
career
after
the
disbandment
of
a
tribe
called
quest
that
was
nine
years
ago
an
eternity
in
hiphop
and
his
recordindustry
journey
since
has
been
downright
purgatorial
an
unreceptive
label
shelved
his
intended
followup
subsequent
efforts
met
with
a
similar
fate
small
wonder
this
rapper
and
producer
feels
as
if
hes
emerging
from
the
dark
ages
but
if
the
renaissance
signals
a
revival
it
also
sticks
to
an
established
script
its
sound
an
upbeat
amalgam
of
jazzinflected
funk
will
ring
familiar
to
any
qtip
fan
or
even
to
the
average
hiphop
nostalgist
a
few
of
the
albums
tracks
can
also
be
found
with
only
slight
variation
on
open
one
of
those
unofficial
releases
and
of
course
theres
that
voice

nasal
grainy
a
little
smartalecky

still
accentuating
the
positive
qtip
took
a
handson
role
as
producer
of
the
renaissance
to
the
point
that
the
music
can
overshadow
the
rapping
its
fitting
that
he
appears
on
the
albums
cover
with
an
mpc
2000xl
sampler
obscuring
his
face
he
has
a
taste
for
headbobbing
tempos
and
inthepocket
bass
lines
some
lifted
from
vintage
soul
records
he
elicits
inventive
work
from
musicians
like
the
guitarist
kurt
rosenwinkel
and
he
makes
decent
use
of
his
guest
singers
including
a
classically
suave
dangelo
an
androgynoussounding
raphael
saadiq
a
sassy
amanda
diva
and
a
coolly
ethereal
norah

some
of
this
works
wickedly

believe
the
dangelo
track
is
a
keeper
as
is
gettin
up
a
charismatic
comeon

but
there
are
just
as
many
small
missteps
a
few
tracks
notably
manwomanboogie
generate
interesting
frictions
but
no
palpable
momentum
official
and
you
suffer
from
lackluster
rhymes
and
worse
dance
on

begins
with
this
dispiriting
couplet
the
people
at
the
label
say
they
want
something
to
repeat
but
all
my
people
really
want
something
for
the
streets
qtip
doesnt
appear
to
realize
how
ridiculous
that
sounds
perhaps
tellingly
the
standout
track
is
move
the
only
one
created
by
an
outsider
its
credited
to
j
dilla
the
producer
who
died
in
2006
and
worked
with
qtip
on
his
longago
solo
debut
here
the
resourcefully
choppy
use
of
a
jackson

produces
something
deep

and

is
a
digital
release
on
artistshare
downloadable
from
artistsharecom
where
you
get
more
not
just
the
album
but
outtakes
previous
performances
videos
of
conversations
and
interviews
the
package
is
geared
toward
listener
satiation
which
suits
hall
and
frisell
fine
they
seem
as
if
they
could
linger
over
their
family
resemblance
for
much
more
than
the
albums
twohour
duration
days
more
years
more
this
record
is
a
lot
to
take
in
its
not
austere
but
it
is
so
reserved
so
subtonally
understated
that
to
breathe
loudly
over
it
is
a
minor
crudeness
there
are
originals
and
jazz
standards
here
but
also
a
duet
version
of
bob
dylans
masters
of
war
and
sometimes
its
unapologetically
meandering
the
dreamlike
migration
with
frisell
constructing
digital
loops
and
hall
playing
droning
noises
or
blues
phrases
over
the
shimmering
backdrops
doesnt
need
to
be
15
minutes
long
in
the
quartet
half
though
the
performances
are
focused
but
still
playful
and
at
best

as
in
owed
to
freddie
green
in
which
both
guitarists
improvise
simultaneously
with
quiet
daring
over
swing
rhythm

they
connect
in
a
properly
complicated
way

empire
miami
the
most
important
bond
girl
in
the
james
bond
movie
series
doesnt
have
a
suggestive
name
like
pussy
galore
or
plenty
otoole
her
name
is
barbara

48
daughter
of
the
late
producer
albert
r
cubby
broccoli
mastermind
of
the
longestrunning
movie
franchise
ever
22
spy
thrillers
since
1962
and
counting
alongside
her
halfbrother
michael
g
wilson
broccoli
preserves
not
only
agent
007s
legacy
but
also
their
fathers
on
a
humid
day
in
miami
broccoli
is
cucumber
cool
while
discussing
those
responsibilities
and
the
newest
bond
adventure
quantum

solace
which
opens
nationwide
nov

shes
likely
the
most
relaxed
officer
of
the
order
of
the
british
empire
anyone
could
meet
a
producer
who
isnt
pushy
or
prone
to
hyperbole
in
interviews
blockbuster
confidence
gleaned
from
her
father
is
enough
broccoli
joined
the
family
business
at
22
serving
as
an
assistant
director
on
1983s
octopussy
in
six
years
she
graduated
to
associate
producer
status
as
the
elder
broccolis
health
began
to
fail
during
preproduction
for
goldeneye
her
father
handed
over
the
keys
of
his
bond
kingdom
he
was
very
ill
broccoli
says
he
told
us
come
on
guys
its
time
you
take
over
ill
be
around
but
youve
got
to
pick
up
the
baton
now

broccoli
and
wilson
ran
with
the
opportunity
revitalizing
the
franchise
by
hiring
pierce
brosnan
to
play
the
suave
secret
agent
then
reinventing
it
with
daniel
craig
as
a
leaner
meaner
007
cubby
broccoli
died
of
heart
failure
in
1996
certain
that
his
life
work
was
in
good
hands
we
do
feel
very
strongly
about
carrying
on
his
legacy
barbara
broccoli
says
when
my
father
and
harry
saltzman
got
the
rights
to
these
films
they
created
this
genre
there
wasnt
this
type
of
movie
before
dr
no
and
from
russia
with
love
john
barry
created
this
kind
of
music
peter
hunt
who
edited
those
first
movies
revolutionized
that
concept
terence
young
an
amazing
director
gave
it
a
look
and
a
style
and
sean
connery
simply
burst
onto
the
screen
we
stand
on
tall
shoulders
here
and
we
have
to
keep
up
what
they
began
none
stand
taller
for
broccoli
than
her
father
a
thirdgeneration
italianamerican
who
she
says
was
the
embodiment
of
the
american
dream
cubby
broccoli
grew
his
namesake
vegetable
imported
to
the
united
states
by
his
grandfather
on
a
queens
ny
farm
and
made
caskets
before
making
his
mark
in
the
movies
i
was
very
close
to
my
father
barbara
broccoli
says
absolutely
adored
and
worshipped
him
i
think
if
hed
been
running
a
pizzeria
id
be
making
pizzas
it
had
a
lot
to
do
with
who
he
was
he
was
great
company
entertaining
a
really
downtoearth
guy
and
a
great
teacher
because
he
shared
his
knowledge
his
basic
rule
was
put
the
money
on
the
screen
he
believed
as
i
do
that
theres
a
lot
of
goodwill
out
there
for
the
bond
movies
people
constantly
come
up
and
say
oh
my
dad
used
to
take
me
or
wed
go
as
a
family
i
really
knew
i
was
grown
up
when
theyd
let
me
see
a
bond
movie
all
the
stories
we
get
from
people
are
about
the
bond
movies
being
part
of
their
family
experience
cubby
taught
his
children
to
never
disappoint
bonds
audience
including
his
reluctance
to
produce
any
other
kind
of
movie
except
1968s
chitty
chitty
bang
bang
based
on
another
ian
fleming
novel
he
felt
like
no
ive
got
to
pay
attention
ive
got
to
make
these
movies
really
good
because
there
is
an
expectation
that
was
something
he
conveyed
to
us
michael
and
i
feel
strongly
the
same
way
in
her
father
and
flemings
memories
broccoli
produced
a
london
stage
version
of
the
fantasy
adventure
in
2002
the
musical
remains
her
only
major
producing
credit
outside
the
bondsphere
just
as
her
father
and
fleming
still
influence
quantum
of
solace
and
any
007
movies
to
come
we
do
think
about
them
very
much
in
these
situations
broccoli
says
my
father
said
whenever
youre
stuck
just
go
back
to
fleming
thats
something
weve
always
done
in
between
movies
we
read
all
the
books
and
short
stories
again
not
because
there
are
things
there
that
havent
been
shot
but
to
kind
of
saturate
ourselves
in
that
world
again
its
the
character
of
bond
that
has
sustained
these
films

radio
scene
the
next
local

war
may
pit
ryan

against

thats
because
more
local

are
using
nationally
syndicated
radio
programs
in
the

of

pushing
aside
local

for

such
as
american

host
seacrest
exentertainment
tonight
host
tesh
and
smooth

the
trend
emerged
in
sharp
relief
last

when
cbs
radio
laid
off
almost
all
the
programming
and
onair
staff
at
smooth
jazz
station
wsjtfm

bringing
in

offered

critics
say
these
moves
are
shortterm
solutions
quick
savings
as
tough
economic
times
make
it
difficult
to
find
new
advertisers
in
the
meantime
tampa
bay
area
radio
finds
less
room
for
local
voices
at
wsjt
for
example
broadcast
architecture
is
given
commercial
space
inside
each
show
to
sell
on
its
own
to
explain
the
numbers
radio
consultant
dan
spice
referenced
delilah
luke
host
of
a
nighttime
music
and
advice
show
syndicated
on
hundreds
of
stations
nationwide
it
looks
good
on
the
budget
because
theres
200
nighttime
jocks
around
the
country
who
dont
have
to
be
paid
said
spice
vice
president
of
californiabased
lund
consultants
but
you
lose
the
mediums
strongest
selling
point
which
is
localism
still
ed
krampf
who
took
over
as
tampa
market
manager
for
cbs
radio
in
early
october
said
hes
more
focused
on
raising
ratings
than
shaving
costs
you
cannot
save
your
way
to
success
he
said
noting
that
the
ad
space
given
up
at
wsjt
is
still
considered
money
spent
by
cbs
at
the
end
of
the
day
people
have
to
listen
and
they
have
to
listen
longer
or
it
doesnt
matter
if
we
save
money
radios
covert
way
to
achieve
such
savings
was
through
voice
tracking
where
a
single
personality
might
record
onair
patter
for
a
number
of
stations
owned
by
the
same
company
in
different
markets
djs
might
even
note
local
landmarks
or
talk
about
recent
community
events
to
build
the
illusion
but
such
audio
sleight
of
hand
generally
involved
personalities
who
were
not
well
known
and
mistakes
with
some
prerecorded
shows
including
incidents
where
weather
emergencies
werent
acknowledged
onair
have
added
to
the
controversy
at
clear
channel
radio
tampa
market
manager
dan
diloreto
scoffed
at
the
idea
that
airing
syndicated
talent
such
as
seacrest
on
wflzfm
933
from
1
to
4
pm
or
tesh
on
wmtxfm
1007
from
9
am
to
2
pm
would
save
money
the
same
way
voice
tracking
does
when
you
bring
in
someone
who
has
a
national
marquee
name



youre
paying
for
that
said
diloreto
who
noted
that
increases
in
outofhome
listening
at
work
have
made
midday
shifts
more
attractive
to
stations
he
also
said
clear
channel
didnt
cut
onair
staff
to
make
room
for
seacrest
instead
shifting
time
slots
around
to
make
room
for
the
show
we
believe
john
tesh
does
a
better
job
entertaining
audiences
diloreto
said
i
couldnt
possibly
reproduce
that
show
locally
but
longtime
area
personality
tedd
webb
worried
such
trends
will
close
off
the
shifts
and
smaller
stations
where
upandcoming
talent
once
learned
how
to
entertain
audiences
we
dont
have
a
minor
league
anymore
said
webb
who
cohosts
the
morning
show
on
wflaam
970
its
cost
prohibitive
today

i
automatically
check
for
moccasins
above
my
head
just
in
case
years
ago
when
i
was
younger
and
more
impressionable
an
oldtimer
known
for
hyperbole
told
me
breathlessly
about
the
time
a
moccasin
fell
from
a
branch
into
his
canoe
first
he
battled
the
venomous
snake
with
his
paddle
it
kept
coming
its
cottoncolored
mouth
opened
wide
finally
he
shot
it
with
his
pistol
killing
the
snake
but
piercing
the
bottom
of
his
own
canoe
he
had
to
swim
through
alligators
to
reach
the
shore
anyway
that
was
his
story
doubtless
exaggerated
even
so
watching
for
moccasins
in
branches
has
become
a
lifelong
habit
one
day
i
hope
to
see
a
moccasin
in
a
tree
because
i
like
the
idea
that
anything
can
happen
on
a
florida
waterway
paddling
a
kayak
requires
in
addition
to
balance
paying
attention
you
dont
want
to
dawdle
under
the
wrong
tree
spruce
creek
which
snakes
12
miles
east
through
volusia
county
before
flowing
into
strickland
bay
and
the
atlantic
beyond
is
one
of
those
halfwild
halfcivilized
places
where
you
will
encounter
alligators
sleeping
on
logs
if
you
are
lucky
and
teenagers
on
jet
skis
if
you
arent
you
may
even
run
into
the
ghost
of
ponce
de
leon
the
first
european
to
visit
the
continent
senor
ponce
named
la
florida
in
1513
according
to
some
accounts
he
sailed
a
skiff
through
an
ocean
inlet
into
a
bay
and
headed
west
into
a
creek
most
likely
spruce
creek
what
did
he
make
of
our
dragons
the
alligators
surely
they
focused
his
attention
they
always
do
for
me
yes
we
have
museums
and
restaurants
and
fine
universities
but
the
presence
of
dinosaurs
is
what
makes
florida
florida
i
assume
that
ponce
de
leon
declined
to
take
a
dip
in
spruce
creek
you
couldnt
pay
me
to
swim
in
it
on
purpose
either
the
water
is
dark
stained
like
tea
from
decaying
leaves
and
mostly
shallow
if
you
startle
a
gator
off
the
bank
into
the
creek
dont
be
alarmed
if
its
back
brushes
your
kayak
or
be
very
alarmed
i
have
been
bumped
by
an
alligator
once
or
twice
but
im
still
here
a
manatee
sleeping
just
under
the
waters
surface
is
much
more
likely
to
knock
you
into
the
drink
if
you
startle
it
by
accident
kayaking
among
manatees
requires
balance
too
i
have
never
seen
a
deer
or
bobcat
sipping
from
the
creek
but
other
people
have
i
mostly
see

mccain
obama
diverge
on
latin
america
president
bush
has
made
more
trips
to
latin
america
than
any
other
president
before
him
nine
in
total
but
during
his
eight
years
in
the
white
house
us
influence
in
the
region
has
fallen
sharply
both
presidential
candidates
john
mccain
and
barack
obama
criticize
bushs
foreign
policy
performance
so
what
would
they
do
differently
and
what
challenges
would
they
face
in
the
region
sen
obama
has
never
visited
latin
america
as
sen
mccain
reminded
the
audience
at
the
last
debate
nevertheless
obamas
candidacy
has
excited
enormous
interest
there
especially
in
countries
with
large
black
populations
such
as
brazil
mccain
has
traveled
to
the
region
extensively
he
was
deeply
involved
in
us
policy
in
central
america
during
the
1980s
when
the
reagan
administration
sent
weapons
and
financial
aid
to
help
defeat
leftwing
revolutionaries
in
el
salvador
and
nicaragua
experts
note
that
latin
america
has
never
loomed
very
large
on
washingtons
radar
screen
at
least
until
a
crisis
explodes
given
the
wars
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
as
well
as
the
current
economic
crisis
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
united
states
will
be
able
to
give
latin
america
the
attention
that
it
needs
in
the
coming
few
years
says
susan
kaufman

brazil
president
bushs

close
personal
relationship
with
brazils
moderate
leftist
president
luis
inacio
lula
da
silva
brazil
has
emerged
as
arguably
the
most
important
strategic
us
ally
in
the
region
mccain
supports
lifting
a
tariff
on
brazilian
ethanol
but
this
is
unpopular
in
americas
grain
states
obama
would
keep
the
tariff
obama
is
popular
with
darkskinned
brazilians
who
make
up
about
half
the
population
cuba
a
mccain
administration
would
stick
with
the
fourdecadesold
economic
embargo
mccain
says
he
would
try
to
strengthen
it
through
greater
international
support
bush
tried
that
but
didnt
get
anywhere
obama
says
he
would
immediately
lift
recent
restrictions
on
cubanamericans
traveling
to
the
island
and
sending
money
to
their
families
there
he
says
he
is
ready
to
meet
with
cuban
leader
raul
castro
though
it
is
not
clear
under
what
conditions
colombia
mccain
is
a
staunch
supporter
of
plan
colombia
the
decadeold
5billion
program
to
help
fight
drugs
and
guerrillas
he
also
backs
a
free
trade
agreement
with
colombia
currently
stalled
in
congress
obama
has
supported
plan
colombia
but
opposed
the
proposed
free
trade
pact
with
colombia
because
of
abuses
of
trade
unionists
obama
says
he
doesnt
oppose
free
trade
on
principle
he
supported
free
trade
with
peru
haiti
though
he
leans
to
the
left
haitian
president
rene
preval
is
a
good
friend
of
the
united
states
he
recognizes
the
importance
of
us
aid
especially
in
the
wake
of
a
disastrous
hurricane
season
obama
may
be
more
sympathetic
to
pressure
from
the
black
caucus
in
congress
to
grant
temporary
status
to
undocumented
haitians
in
the
united
states
after
hurricanes
gustav
and
ike
which
left
more
than
500
haitians
dead
and
destroyed
the
countrys
road
network
the
bush
administration
temporarily
suspended
deportation
of
haitians
mccain
is
also
sympathetic
on
immigrant
issues
though
he
has
not
taken
an
active
interest
in
haiti
policy
mexico
a
bloody
drug
war

has
barely
been

mccain
made
a

in

the
first
ever
by
a
presidential
candidate
and
offered
his
support
for

the

mccain
and
obama
are
sympathetic
to
calls
for

official
for

says
the

should
suspend
all
venezuelan
oil
imports
10
percent
of
the
us
total
that
would
send
prices
higher
in
the
united

experts
say
and
chavez
would
likely
have
no
problem
selling
his
oil
elsewhere
obama
is
more
willing
to
sit
down
and
work
out
their
differences
it
is
important
for
us
not
to
overreact
in
relation
to
chavez
he
said
in
one
recent

what
we
must
do
is
to
make
him
understand
that
we
do
not
want

to
continue

that
we

commentary
why
i
intend
to
carry
a
handgun
the
weapon
was
light
in
my
hands
not
at
all
how
i
imagined
a
9mm
glock
would
feel
i
had
never
fired
a
gun
in
my
life
my
instructor
put
both
my
hands
around
the
frame
and
then
signaled
for
me
to
squeeze
the
trigger
blam
the
bullet
pierced
my
target
an
85by11inch
sheet
of
copy
paper
near
the
center
then
it
hit
me
this
is
how
it
is
done
this
is
how
you
take
a
life
my
target
was
fictional
but
in
my
mind
he
was
still
a
threat
i
felt
no
sadness
thats
why
soon
ill
be
the
first
person
in
my
immediate
family
and
circle
of
friends
to
get
a
concealed
weapons
permit
i
wanted
training
before
purchasing
a
gun
so
i
enrolled
in
class
at
shooting
sports
of
tampa
when
i
arrived
my
nerves
calmed
half
of
my
class
of
15
was
female
and
a
quarter
of
us
were
black
its
not
just
me
i
thought
to
myself
everyone
is
afraid
these
days
at
shooting
sports
the
building
smelled
as
if
it
were
on
fire
and
all
15
people
in
my
class
were
herded
into
a
tiny
room
off
in
the
corner
where
our
instructor
put
the
fear
of
god
in
us
before
we
even
got
into
the
gun
range
just
because
you
have
a
gun
does
not
mean
you
are
capable
of
fighting
with
a
gun
he
cautioned
no
sane
person
in
the
world
would
ever
want
to
be
in
a
gunfight
though
i
was
never
around
them
guns
were
a
part
of
life
where
i
grew
up
washington
dc
but
because
of
a
handgun
ban
the
only
folks
who
had
them
were
cops
and
criminals
until
the
rule
was
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
earlier
this
year
still
i
never
felt
unsafe
not
until
i
moved
to
florida
alone
now
ill
take
my
chances
on
fighting
for
myself
i
havent
had
much
luck
with
the
kindness
of
strangers
since
living
on
my
own
in
florida
i
have
not
been
able
to
name
the
person
next
door
to
me
at
any
point
no
one
has
come
to
introduce
themselves
and
the
one
time
i
tried
to
be
cordial
the
neighbor
peered
through
the
blinds
and
never
opened
the
door
i
am
not
confident
that
woman
would
have
called
the
police
if
she
ever
heard
me
scream
inside
my
apartment
in
my
junior
year
of
college
at
florida
aampampm
university
in
tallahassee
i
had
a
roommate
who
never
spoke
to
me
only
by
looking
at
her
mail
did
i
know
her
name
we
never
interacted
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
my
room
with
the
door
locked
when
i
went
home
for
christmas
break
i
bought
a
storage
unit
for
my
valuables
because
i
was
afraid
shed
rob
me
when
i
returned
she
was
gone
and
i
was
living
alone
for
the
first
time
ever
the
summer
before
i
moved
in
the
house
next
door
was
invaded
and
a
girl
was
killed
i
was
terrified
that
was
the
first
time
getting
a
gun
ever
entered
my
mind
but
id
never
even
seen
one
in
person
and
was
sure
that
20
was
not
old
enough
to
buy
a
gun
twentyyearolds
arent
even
allowed
to
drink
beer
they
couldnt
possibly
get
hold
of
a
firearm
right
but
in
florida
you
can
buy
a
handgun
from
a
private
person
or
a
rifle
or
shotgun
from
a
licensed
dealer
at
18
you
have
to
be
21
to
get
a
concealed
weapons
permit
and
gun
safety
training
is
mandatory
permit
holders
are
held
to
a
different
standard
my
instructor
said
i
had
to
buy
50
rounds
in
class
to
get
through
my
target
practice
protective
ear
covers
muffled
the
sounds
of
the
controlled
explosions
at
the
end
of
my
arm
protective
eyewear
kept
the
little
metal
shavings
from
the
side
walls
from
flying
into
my
eyes
a
couple
of
hot
shell
casings
flew
out
and
landed
on
my
hands
temporarily
searing
knuckles
and
making
me
wince
with
my
finger
still
on
the
trigger
id
fired
the
gun
in
class
but
if
my
paper
assailant
was
flesh
and
blood
could
i
do
the
same
thing
could
i
defend
my
own
life
then
i
thought
about
nefertiti
williams
a
20yearold
public
relations
student
she
had
leaned
on
me
for
help
developing
her
story
ideas
because
i
was
the
editor
of
the
school
magazine
at
the
time
she
was
bright
perceptive
had
good
instincts
and
asked
the
right
questions
she
called
me
momma
robbyn
at
times
a
nickname
i
didnt
embrace
well
at
21
the
wednesday
before
thanksgiving
2006
i
got
a
call
from
my
roommate
and
close
friend
telling
me
nefertiti
hadnt
made
it
back
to
bradenton
she
had
been
murdered
in
her
own
home
by
a
roommate
after
everyone
else
had
left
for
the
holiday
he
had
shot
her
in
the
face
just
under
her
cheekbone
before
shooting
himself
police
later
said
hed
been
experiencing
depression
because
he
was
no
longer
enrolled
in
school
and
that
it
was
unclear
why
he
had
shot
her
it
could
have
been
a
crime
of
passion
or
just
a
mistake
that
he
felt
he
couldnt
live
with
when
we
returned
to
school
there
were
candles
and
vigils
and
crying
and
sorrow
but
there
were
no
answers
would
this
have
been
different
if
she
had
a
gun
in
her
bedroom
or
in
one
of
many
designer
purses
i
dont
know
but
the
odds
wouldnt
have
been
so
stacked
against
her
getting
my
footing
was
a
challenge
at
the
range
when
my
feet
were
far
enough
apart
my
shoulders
were
too
far
back
when
my
shoulders
were
above
my
toes
my
thumbs
were
behind
the
hammer
when
my
thumbs
were
crisscrossed
my
feet
were
too
close
together
i
was
comfortable
firing
this
gun
but
not
with
following
the
instructions
what
was
wrong
with
me
i
do
understand
the
power
of
guns
my
father
was
gunned
down
while
he
was
leaving
a
convenience
store
i
was
2
he
wasnt
a
criminal
and
he
had
never
owned
a
gun
he
was
in
the
air
force
he
knew
how
to
use
a
gun
he
learned
it
in
basic
training
he
could
have
had
one
easily
but
the
law
wasnt
on
his
side
probably
not
coincidentally
washington
dc
was
known
as
the
murder
capital
for
much
of
my
childhood
the
law
is
on
my
side
here
and
i
intend
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
so
i
started
researching
the
process
of
obtaining
a
concealed
weapons
permit
and
purchasing
a
gun
its
not
hard
but
it
takes
time
you
have
to
really
want
it
first
you
have
to
submit
a
form
to
get
the
application
mailed
to
you
which
can
take
two
weeks
then
comes
certification
class
four
hours
of
safety
training
proving
competency
with
firing
a
weapon
was
difficult
since
it
was
first
gun
i
had
ever
touched
but
i
earned
the
certificate
necessary
for
my
application
then
i
got
a
15
passport
photo
and
my
fingerprints
taken
digitally
and
put
in
the
state
database
at
the
tampa
police
station
that
service
was
49
then
i
took
everything
to
a
notary
and
had
them
seal
my
application
got
a
money
order
for
75
paid
postage
and
sent
the
application
to
tallahassee
if
i
qualify
the
florida
department
of
agriculture
and
consumer
services
will
promptly
issue
me
my
permit
next
year
ive
been
without
a
gun
for
23
years
so
ill
just
wait
a
little
longer
now
is
my
mother
supportive
no
she
jokes
about
it
with
my
brother
and
calls
me
little
sarah
palin
but
something
tells
me
shes
not
sold
on
the
idea
why
would
you
want
a
gun
she
said
what
if
someone
uses
it
on
you
what
if
it
goes
off
by
accident
do
you
even
know
how
to
use
a
gun
what
if
the
other
person
has
a
gun
too
nothing
i
said
could
convince
her
that
there
may
be
an
upside
to
being
able
to
defend
yourself
but
she
understands
that
i
am
an
adult
and
my
decisions
are
my
own
her
nervousness
was
making
me
a
bit
uneasy
with
my
decision
what
if
i
really
cant
handle
a
gun
what
if
im
forgetful
with
it
like
my
wallet
and
someone
uses
it
to
commit
a
crime
what
if
someone
steals
my
car
or
snatches
the
purse
i
picked
out
to
carry
it
in
in
the
end
i
fight
one
type
of
paranoia
and
embrace
the
other
at
least
with
a
gun
i
can
level
the
playing
field
ive
picked
out
my
glock
19
at
shooting
sports
and
i
plan
to
make
my
purchase
the
day
after
thanksgiving
im
planning
to
start
by
carrying
my
gun
everywhere
im
allowed
to
on
the
weekend
while
attending
ladies
night
at
the
range
on
mondays
after
that
who
knows
maybe
ill
carry
every
day
you
cant
know
and
thats
the
point
robbyn
mitchell
can
be
reached
at
rmitchellsptimescom
it
was
a
remarkable

with
an
equally
remarkable
pedigree
and
by
all
accounts
it
was

i
think
we

if

it

not

capsule
for
just
him
watching
this

during
its
run
here
in
late
summer
was
a
voyage
to
a
distant
past
for
new
yorkers
who
remember
when
loft
meant
something
quite
different
from
the
luxury
apartment
with
huge
windows
that
it
has
come
to
signify
mikeys
loft
is
the
sort
of
place
one
might
have
found
in
downtown
manhattan
30
years
ago
a
wideopen
apartment
with
a
sweeping
high
ceiling
cut
from
an
old
manufacturing
space
there
was
a
romance
attached
to
loft
living
in
those
days
they
seemed
bohemian
and
sexy
but
it
wasnt
always
easy
you
go
back
to
the
70s
it
was
painful
to
live
in
a
loft
said
chuck
delaney
a
founding
member
of
the
lower
manhattan
loft
tenants
association
people
did
it
because
it
was
cheap
and
big
those
raw
spaces
are
difficult
to
find
these
days

maybe
impossible
in
manhattan

but
they
do
exist
in
pockets
of
the
other
boroughs
in
lessestablished
neighborhoods
they
can
even
be
affordable
especially
if
you
are
looking
to
rent
rather
than
buy

a

from

moved
into
just
this
sort
of
apartment
two
years
ago
a
1100squarefoot
room
in
bushwick
brooklyn
reigelman
came
to
new
york
two
and
a
half
years
ago
for
a
design
internship
after
that
he
said
it
was
either
find
a
job
or
try
to
make
my
own
work
successful
he
chose
the
latter
now
he
makes
his
living
as
a
freelance
designer
splitting
the

two

chris

who
designs

it
was
like
a
blank
canvas
reigelman
said
of
his
apartment
it
had
an
identity
but
it
was
so
loosely
configured
it
was
really
easy
to
come
in
and
make
it
something
brandnew
make
something
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
felt
was
really
ours
reigelman
is
trained
in
sculpture
and
industrial
design
and
his
original
roommate
was
a
sculptor
we
already
had
the

their

from

at

it

light

according
to

at

only
about
100000
manufacturing
jobs
remain
in
the

a
tenth
of
the
total
at
the
peak
after
world
war
ii
as
businesses
trickled
out
of
the
city
landlords
began
renting
manufacturing
space
to
individuals
either
to
fill
vacancies
or
to
get
higher
rent
from
residential
tenants
the
buildings
often
had
basic
plumbing
but
heat
was
unreliable
rooms
and
walls
were
not
part
of
the
deal
much
less
garbage
pickup
some
lofts
were
rife
with
fire
hazards
these
spaces
were
generally
not
up
to
code
or
were
not
zoned
for
residential
use
tenants
lived
illegally
under
commercial
leases
or
other
tenuous
circumstances
there
was
a
shivery
feeling
that
you
could
be
evicted
at
any

it
is
impossible
to
know
how
many
in

and
1980s
there
were
several
attempts
to
bring

said
sandy
hornick
the
director
of
strategic
planning
for
new
york
city
the
loft
regulations
that
followed
he
said
were
a
recognition
of
this
sort
of
changing
phenomenon
trying
to
bring
some
order
to
the
chaos
the
original
settlers
of
loft
buildings
were
often
artists
eager
to
take
advantage
of
cheap
rents
as
well
as
big
spaces
and
loadbearing
floors
which
allowed
for
large
projects
a
lot
of
them
were
if
not
artists
craftsmen
of
some
sort
or
another
who
both
lived
and
worked
in
their
spaces
said
carl
weisbrod
the
first
chairman
of
the
loft
board
and
now
the
head
of
trinity
churchs
real
estate
operations
whatever
their
occupations
he
added
they
had
to
be
particularly
handy
and
resilient
and
resourceful
so
they
could
really
create
a
living
space
today
a
second
or
third
generation
of
tenants
live
in
these
lofts
often
without
the
hardships
that
their
predecessors
in
the
70s
experienced
two
years
ago
when
albert
senavitis
moved
into
an
apartment
in
an
old
bushwick
loft
building
once
owned
by
a
plastics
company
a
sleeping
loft
was
already
there
senavitis

a
film
student
at
the

uses
the
big
open

to

movies
create

with

and
even
shoot

on
a
corner
of

remains

you
always
see
dust
and
sparks
flying
around
here
senavitis
said
then
at
like
5
oclock
its
dead
asked
if
he
feels
safe
in
the

senavitis
said
in
this
part
of
bushwick
definitely
other
parts
not
so
much
last
spring
he
was
mugged
while
walking
to
a

however
raw
the

or
cheap
the
rent
if
the
apartments
are
legal
loft
tenants
are
entitled
to
the
same
residential
services
as
any
other
new
yorker
and
unlike
their
predecessors
most
of
this
latest
breed
of
tenants
expect
those
services
when
i
rented
lofts

and
i
rented
a
lot
of
them

i
took
care
of
everything

risen
about
100
a

than
four
years

but
he
says
he
is
satisfied
i
think
im
still
getting
a
decent
deal
its
still
worth
it
to
me
for
some
the
lifestyle
of

that
have
not
been

is
what
makes

appealing
ian
roberts
28
lives
in
a
loft
on
mckibben
street
in
bushwick

in
one
of
two
buildings
that
have
earned
the
nickname
mckibben
dorms
for
their
young
residents
and
high
turnover
as
well
as
their
wild
parties
and
overcrowded
apartments
the
noise
and
the
parties
are
certainly
present
roberts
says
as
well
as
some
persistent
leaks
but
on
the
other
hand
his
share
of
the
rent
is
835
a
month
and
the
place
can
take
what
he
and
his
roommates
dish
out
with
these
floors
he
said
pointing
to
hardwood
that
had
seen
better
days
we
dont
have
to
worry
about
sliding
light
stands
or
doing
crafts
projects
roberts
and
two
of
his
three
roommates
are
photographers
i
just
like
to
be
able
to
walk
in
my
apartment
said
roberts
striding
back
and
forth
i
just
like
space
he
and
jeff
brown
have
lived
in
the
loft
for
three
years
they
built
the
bedrooms
themselves

roberts
father
a
general
contractor
provided
some
tips
like
many
loft
apartments
theirs
is
a
big
rectangular
room
carved
out
of
a
much
larger
floor
it
has
windows
on
only
one
wall
which
means
the
bedrooms
built
on
the
interior
are
stuffy
and
dim
but
then
again
those
windows
stretch
30
feet
wide
and
are
8
12
feet
tall
one
of
the
best
parts
about
living
here
is
the
sun
roberts
said
with
his
arms
splayed
wide
pointing
left
and
right
it
really
does
come
up
over
there
and
set
over
there
this
incident
has
entered
operatic
lore
ten
years
ago
the
soprano
renee
fleming
was
lustily
booed
by
an
audience
at
la
scala
in
milan
for
her
performance
in
the
title
role
of
donizettis
lucrezia
borgia
its
a
juicy
story
but
its
not
quite
true
that
night
vociferous
audience
members
indeed
booed
fleming
according
to
eyewitnesses
others
cheered
her
but
its
hardly
unusual
for
finicky
la
scala
patrons
to
break
into
warring
factions
frustration
had
built
up
because
the
conductor
that
night
had
passed
out
on
the
podium
and
had
to
take
a
30minute
break
flemings
remaining
performances
during
the
run
passed
without
incident
in
2000
she
proved
she
could
sing
this
daunting
role
impressively
in
a
concert
performance
with
the
opera
orchestra
of
new
york
at
carnegie
hall
and
on
saturday
night
fleming
who
continually
reassesses
her
repertory
choices
returned
to
this
touchstone
bel
canto
role
at
the
washington
national
opera
when
a
new
production
directed
and
designed
by
john
pascoe
and
conducted
by
placido
domingo
was
introduced
at
the
kennedy
center
this
was
flemings
debut
with
the
company
though
her
performance
was
vocally
uneven
whole
stretches
were
sumptuous
making
pretty
sounds
was
clearly
not
her
goal
she
threw
herself
into
the
daunting
role
taking
enormous
vocal
risks
singing
with
raw
intensity
and
earthy
richness
utterly
inhabiting
the
character
of
this
beautiful
murderous
noblewoman
in
renaissance
italy
lucrezia
borgia
which
had
its
premiere
at
la
scala
in
1833
is
considered
a
major
donizetti
work
yet
it
has
been
produced
with
surprising
infrequency
in
america
the
only
metropolitan
opera
production
was
in
1904
and
this
was
the
works
premiere
with
the
washington
company
the
score
is
melodically
opulent
and
dramatically
urgent
verdis
macbeth
would
have
been
impossible
without
donizettis
example
here
no
doubt
some
opera
companies
are
put
off
by
the
story
loosely
based
on
the
historical
lucrezia
borgia
the
daughter
of
a
ruthless
machiavellian
nobleman
who
connived
his
way
into
power
and
eventually
the
papacy
in
the
opera
lucrezia
is
a
femme
fatale
married
to
duke
alfonso
of
ferrara
when
the
opera
begins
lucrezia
has
tracked
down
gennaro
a
young
warrior
and
her
illegitimate
son
though
only
she
knows
this
gennaro
falls
for
lucrezia
instantly
as
things
often
happen
in
opera
until
he
discovers
that
she
is
the
reviled
lucrezia
borgia
who
willfully
poisons
rivals
in
love
and
in
politics
in
researching
the
veiled
history
of
the
borgias
and
examining
the
victor
hugo
tragedy
from
which
the
opera
is
adapted
pascoe
has
come
to
see
lucrezia
as
a
determined
woman
probably
a
victim
of
abuse
as
a
girl
trying
to
survive
in
a
ferociously
masculine
world
in
which
revenge
and
murder
become
the
wages
of
love
as
he
put
it
in
a
program
note
this
doesnt
seem
a
revelatory
take
on
the
opera
after
all
donizetti
gives
his
monstrous
heroine
some
anguished
and
elegant
music
even
her
fiery
calls
for
vengeance
are
expressed
through
eerie
outbursts
of
coloratura
roulades
that
make
lucrezia
seem
tragically
unhinged

oldfashioned

is
spiked

contemporary

twists

entwine
in
twos
and

and
more
pascoe
certainly
evokes
the
storys
sordidness
but
the
garishly
ornate
cartoonish
costumes
baffled
me
pascoes
aim
was
to
depict
the
period
applying
a

to

her
performance
is
smart
and
honest
sometimes
as
she
executes
an
expressive
turn
or
vocal
gesture
her
voice
will
become
breathy
in

on

high

but
she
never
compromises
her

for

her

of

bureau
at
the
agriculture
ministry
said
saturday
according
to
a
transcript
of
his
news
conference
but
government
officials
also
said
that
chinas
animal
feed
supply
was
largely
safe
and
that
the
quality
of
feed
had
improved
in
recent
years
they
insisted
that
only
a
small
number
of
rogue
operators
had
deliberately
added
melamine
to
feed
often
using
it
as
cheap
filler
to
save
money
the
government
response
was
similarly
reassuring
early
last
year
when
several
animal
feed
makers
were
caught
exporting
melaminetainted
feed
ingredients
to
the
united
states
and
other
countries
resulting
in
contaminated
pet
food
supplies
that
sickened
and
killed
cats
and
dogs
that
case
led
to
the
largest
pet
food
recall
in
american
history
melamine
dealers
in
china
said
in
interviews
last
year
and
as
recently
as
friday
that
it
was
not
uncommon
for
animal
feed
producers
to
buy
melamine
scrap
the
cheaper
waste
left
over
after
producing
melamine
products
and
to
use
it
as
filler
still
some
food
safety
officials
are
asking
consumers
not
to
be
too
alarmed
although
the
contaminated
eggs
found
in
hong
kong
exceeded
the
government
limit
for
melamine
a

the

the
outcome
promises
to
have
a
profound
impact

either
upping

ante
irrevocably
or
forcing
sweeping
changes
to
prevent

large
amounts
of
cash
from
coursing
through
campaigns
again
but
just
as
it
has
in
this
election
cycle
it
is
likely
that
politics
as
much
as
principle
will
shape
the
jockeying
democrats
in
particular
who
have
traditionally
supported
limits
on
campaign
spending
are
grappling
with
whether
they
can
embrace
obamas
example
without
being
seen
as
hypocritical
they
are
keenly
aware
that
they
have
developed
through
the
internet
a
commanding
fundraising
advantage
over
republicans
much
like
the
directmail
money
machine
that
conservatives
used
to
lord
over
them
i
think
there
is
going
to
be
tremendous
reluctance
on
our
side
to
yield
any
of
that
advantage

bob

the
democratic
former
senator
from
nebraska
who
serves
as
an
honorary
chairman
of
a
group
that
fights
for
public
financing
of
federal
races
wrote
an
opinion
article
in
the
new
york
post
last
week
in
which
he
confessed
to
newfound
ambivalence
on
the
issue
in
light
of
obamas
success
among
small
donors
and
the
energy
he
has
seen
in
this
years
election
he
said
in
an
interview
that
part
of
his
change
of
heart
might
indeed
be
related
to
the
existing
systems
benefits
to
democrats
and
he
said
he
believed
many
others
in
his
party
were
wrestling
with
the
issue
anew
because
of
the
changed
calculus
but
he
added
that
obamas
army
of
small
donors
had
altered
the
terms
of
the
debate
causing
him
to
believe
that
he
had
been
wrong
about
the
need
for
such
limitations
i
think
the
reformers
arguments
have
been
substantially
undercut
by
the
facts
on
the
ground
kerrey
said
both
candidates
have
campaigned
as
reformers
and
declared
that
restoring
the
public
financing
system
for
presidential
campaigns
would
be
a
priority
in
their
administration
but
obama
apparently
did
not
absorb
much
by
way
of
political
cost
when
he
broke
a
pledge
to
accept
public
financing
if
his
opponent
did
as
well
obama
built
a
huge
financial
advantage
over
the
republican
nominee
sen
john
mccain
which
may
have
written
the
epitaph
for
the
current
system
an

most
americans
did
not
even
know
who
was
taking

and
who
was
not
only
mccain
opted
for
the
84
million
in
public
financing
but
the
survey
also
found
most
of
those
polled
supported
limits
on
campaign
spending
house
and
senate
leadership
aides
said
it
was
highly
unlikely
that
the
issue
would
earn
much
attention
next
year
given
other
priorities
like
the
economy
and
the
war
in
iraq
there
is
also
the
matter
of
the
brewing
debate
among
democrats
who
will
probably
control
congress
over
whether
such
limits
are
even
warranted
democrats
may
decide
this
is
working
pretty
well
said
rep
david
price
dnc
who
last
year
was
the
lead
sponsor
of
a
measure
in
the
house
to
update
the
presidential
public
financing
system
i
dont
really
know
what
might
materialize
in
the
way
of
views
on
our
side
campaign
finance
reform
has
been
a
signature
cause
for
mccain
though
he
declined
in
recent
years
to
sponsor
bills
updating
the
presidential
public
financing
system
yet
if
mccain
were
to
win
on
tuesday
the
resistance
in
democratic
circles
to
new
financing
rules
would
presumably
only
grow
as
they
plot
another
assault
on
the
republicans
white
house
grip
in
2012
the
existing
presidential
public
financing
system
began
in
the
1970s
after
the
watergate
scandal
as
a
way
to
limit
the
influence
of
money
in
politics
but
it
has
not
kept
pace
with
increased
spending
the
2004
race
was
the
first
time
both
major
nominees
kerry
and
president
bush
decided
to
bypass
the
federal
matching
funds
for
the
primary
obama
became
the
first
major
party
candidate
to
opt
out
of
the
system
for
the
general
election
such
a
move
allows
candidates
to
raise
more
money
but
advocates
for
tighter
restrictions
on
campaign
finance
said
they
were
alarmed
by
the
more
than
15
billion
that
had
been
raised
by
the
presidential
candidates
in
this
years
primary
and
general
elections

the
first
time
the
presidential
aspirants
have
topped
1
billion
the
obama
campaign
raised
640
million
the
mccain
camp
less
than
250
million
the
advocates
said
that
they
were
poised
to
begin
aggressively
lobbying
for
changes
to
the
public
financing
system
and
that
they
hoped
the
issue
would
be
taken
up
quickly
by
the
new
president
and
congress
the
bill
they
are
promoting
seeks
to
offer
new
incentives
to
participate
in
the
public
finance
system
by
substantially
increasing
the
amount
of
public
money
available
to
candidates
its
provisions
include
increasing
the
ratio
of
public
matching
funds
available
in
the
primary
eliminating
statebystate
primary
spending
limits
and
increasing
the
size
of
the
grant
for
the
general
election
advocates
for
the
bill
said
they
were
not
convinced
of
obamas
argument

now
being
embraced
by
many
fellow
democrats

that
by
raising
unprecedented
sums
from
small
donors
he
has
addressed
the
problem
of
bigmoney
influence
in
politics
skeptics
note
that
obama
raised
record
amounts
from
large
donors
as
well
in
addition
they
said
this
years
presidential
campaign
highlighted
new
issues
among
them
megadonors
to
joint
fundraising
committees
that
benefit
the
candidate
and
the
party
as
well
as
questions
about
the
integrity
of
internet
donations
an
issue
that
has
drawn
increasing
scrutiny
in
recent
weeks
because
of
the
obama
campaigns
lucrative
online
efforts
whether
we
get
to
move
this
meaningful
campaign
reform
forward
is
going
to
depend
largely
on
the
leadership
of
either
obama
or
mccain

of
them

they
dont

going
to
have
a
hard
time
convincing
congress
to
take
up
the
issue
an
article
of
faith
among
conservative
critics
of
american
universities
has
been
that
liberal
professors
politically
indoctrinate
their
students
this
conviction
not
only
fueled
the
culture
wars
but
has
also
led
state
lawmakers
to
consider
requiring
colleges
to
submit
reports
to
the
government
detailing
their
progress
in
ensuring
intellectual
diversity
prompted
universities
to
establish
faculty
positions
devoted
to
conservatism
and
spurred
the
creation
of
a
network
of
volunteer
watchdogs
to
monitor
political
correctness
on
campuses
but
three
sets
of
researchers
recently
concluded
that
professors
have
virtually
no
impact
on
the
political
views
and
ideology
of
their
students
if
there
has
been
a
conspiracy
among
liberal
faculty
members
to
influence

done

to
play
a
part
in
a

that
could
cost

of
thousands

it
remained
unclear
whether
the

were
also
seeking
to
avoid
making
any
decision
that
would
conflict
with
the
goals
of
a
new

has
said
in

that
he
supports
increasing

while
sen
john

has
not
said
whether
he
would
support

beyond
the
25

while
gm

officials
who
did
not

of

a

of
measures
on
sunday
in
response
to
a

in

by
extremist
jewish
settlers
in
the
west
bank
including
a
halt
to
all
direct

government
financing
of

the
announcement
amounted
to
an
acknowledgment
that
public
funds
were
still
being
spent
on
the
outposts
contrary
to
government
policy
and
despite
a
longstanding
pledge
to
the

to
remove
at

two

immediately
militant

is
exacted

actions
against

weekly
cabinet
meeting
here
olmert
said
the
overwhelming
majority
of
jewish
settlers
were
lawabiding
citizens
but
he
said
there
is
also
a
not

group
of
wild
people
who
behave
in
a
way
that
threatens
proper
law
and

in

areas
in
which
they
live
but
also
in
the
overall
atmosphere
of

among
the
measures
olmert
proposed
for
curbing
the
violence
were
an
increase
in

the

those
were
the

his

ripping
his

covering
him
with

cream

the

still
go

lately
someone
has
been
beeping

the

a

an

out
that

zero

it
wasnt

funny
anymore
gone
too
is
that
loud
physicality
of
the

headsets

computerized

mean
less
running

fewer

softer

a
smaller
chance
for
error
those
technological
advances
have
opened
the
market
to
just
about
anyone
with
a
computer
making
floor
trading
seem
almost
quaint
many
traders
retired
rather
than
change
their
ways
others
got
laid
off

one
now

good

answers
ackerman
39
father

from

ridge
nj
good
question
but

no
he
and
all
the
people
down
on
that

are
executing
trades
on

of
others
using
a
hybrid
method
that
combines
a
computers
technology
with
a
humans
gut
instinct
they
do
not
deal
in
subprime

they
do
not
get

parachutes
but
hey
good
question
these
brokers
make
money
whether
the
market
goes
up
or
down
their
earnings
depend
on
the
volume
of
trades
and
the

the

just
two

after

condoleezza

the

suggested
that

off
against

a

consultancy

this
is
a
shot
across
the
bow
to
the
new
administration
in
washington
russian
energy
companies
have
been
offering
libya
sweeping
cooperation
and
investment
programs
in
a
bold
offer
in
july
for
example
gazprom
the
russian
natural
gas
monopoly
offered
to
buy
all
of
libyas
natural
gas
production
in
a
deal
that
could
help
gazprom
corner
the
european
natural
gas
market
so
far
libya
has
been
noncommittal
now
apparently
in
an
effort
to
sweeten
the
deal
with
something
the
untied
states
would
not
likely
offer
russian
authorities
are
negotiating
to
provide
libya
a
civilian
nuclear
research
reactor
though
it
was
unclear
whether
the
sides
reached
an
agreement
on
this
issue
over
the
weekend
libyan
officials
were
quoted
by
reuters
as
saying
that
russia
had
agreed
to
build
the
reactor
while
a
spokesman
for
putin
dmitri
s
peskov
said
the
talks
had
not
concluded
in
the
portion
of

putin
said
russia
and
libya
are
major
producers
of
oil
and
gas
gadhafi
said
in
comments
translated
into
russian
by
the
interfax
news
agency
we
think
alike
about
gas
and
oil
policies
the
colonels
visit
followed
a
long
courtship
by
gazprom
the
worlds
largest
natural
gas
company
and
supplier
of
about
40
percent
of
the
european
unions
gas
imports
for
now
the
north
african
nations
of
libya
and
algeria
compete
with
russia
to
supply
gas
to
southern
europe
but
russia
is
toying
with
forming
an
opecstyle
group
the
gas
exporting
countries
forum
to
eliminate
this
competition
at
the
same
time
gazprom
has
been
buying
licenses
to
libyan
gas
fields
in
joint
ventures
with
the
italian
company
eni
and
germanys
wintershall
both
companies
traded
libyan
licenses
for
access
to
coveted
reserves
in
russia
in
a
sign
of
how
highly
russia
prizes
the
prospect
of
an
energy
alliance
with
libya
some
analysts
say
that
if
gazprom
succeeds
in
wrapping
up
supply
from
libya
and
algeria
it
could
dominate
the
supply
to
southern
europe
gadhafi
seemed
to
embrace
the
idea
of
closer
commercial
ties
unfortunately
in
the
past
our
relations
have
been
mainly
focused
on
military
and
diplomatic
contacts
and
there
was
virtually
no
cooperation
in
civilian
sectors
he

with

dmitri
a

i

that
such

is

important
in

seattlecandidates
for
the
sheer

award
of
the
2008
election
are
numerous
but
any
competition
must
be
judged
not
only
on
brazenness
and
mud
throwing
but
on
the
effectiveness
of
it
we
start
with
a
natural
nominee
the
building
industry
association
of
washington
for
its
antigov
chris

signs
in
eastern
washington
with
the
message

for
his
skill
at
demonizing
and
selfpromotion
the
academic

debate
in
the
dave

burner
race
cant
be
ignored
the
encounter
between
burner
and
komo4
pundits
ken
schram
and
john
carlson
is
a
classic
example
of
how
you
can
turn
a
minor
exaggeration
into
a
major
liability
the
sheer
gall
winner
however
was
instantly
evident
as
i
listened
to
radio
news
on
friday
an
ad
for
initiative
1000
which
would
legalize
assisted
suicide
condemned
a
small
group
of
outofstate
religious
leaders
for
trying
to
buy
the
election
impose
their
will
and
defeat
washingtons
deathwithdignity

i1000
is
leading
in
the
polls
but
its

comprise
a
landslide
of
distortions
there

law
voters
are
being
asked
to
change
the
law
to
allow

to
assist

lives
the
religious

reference
is
a
slam
at
the
catholic

the

has
openly
bashed
catholics
in
missives
to
liberal
bloggers
code
phrases
are
used
in

and
on
the
air
why
has
a
political
figure
as
distinguished
as
exgov
dan
evans
put
his
name
on
the
line
for
a
campaign
that
uses
this
line
the
outofstate
charge
is
the
biggest
canard
true
the
coalition
against
assisted
suicide
has
raised
15
million
much
of
which
has
come
from
catholic
groups
the
knights
of
columbus
is
the
biggest
giver
but
supporters
of
the

put
together

how
bout
it
booth
this
city
has
long
been
regarded
as
the
cultural
intellectual
and
artistic
heart
of
pakistan
famous
for
its
poets
and
writers
its
gardens
and
historic
sites
left
over
from
the
mughal
empire
the
turmoil
sown
by
militancy
may
have
reached
into
the
capital
islamabad
but
it
rarely
seemed
to
intrude
here
among
the
leafy
boulevards
that
are
home
to
many
of
pakistans
secularminded
elite
but
in
recent
weeks
panic
has
found
its
way
even
here
with
a
series
of
small
bombs
and
other
threats
that
offer
a
measure
of
just
how
deeply
the
fear
of
militant
groups
like
the
taliban
has
penetrated
pakistani
society
on
oct
7
three
small
bombs
exploded
in
juice
shops
in
a
sprawling
congested
neighborhood
called
garhi
shahu
the
shops
which
had
gained
a
reputation
as
dating
points
offering
enclosed
booths
for
young
couples
to
cuddle
were
gutted
in
the
blasts
one
person
was
killed
and
several
others
were
wounded
an
unknown
group
called
tehreekul
haya
or
movement
for
decency
claimed
responsibility
and
warned
of
more
attacks
against
centers
of
immorality
in
the
city
on
oct
9
shabbir
labha
the
president
of
the
local
traders
association
received
an
unsigned
handwritten
letter
that
threatened
to
bomb
lahores
biggest
video
and
music
market
the
next
day
he
got
an
anonymous
phone
call
asking
him
if
he
could
do
something
about
the
sale
of
the
pornographic
cds
and
dvds
there
i
assured
the
caller
that
i
can
labha
recalled
sitting
in
his
basement
office
on
a
recent
afternoon
within
a
day
the
traders
had
handed
over
more
than
60000
pornographic
videos
and
burned
them
in
a
bonfire
as
the
citys
top
government
officials
the
police
and
a
large
crowd
looked
on
we
were
not
sure
if
the
threats
were
made
by
the
taliban
or
not
labha
said
but
the
bomb
blasts
in
garhi
shahu
had
made
us
apprehensive
we
didnt
want
to
take
any
chances
the
fact
that
a
single
anonymous
letter
could
inspire
such
a
spectacle
surprised
many
people
here
some
voiced
alarm
that
the
tolerant
liberal
outlook
of
lahore
was
under
attack
from
talibanstyle
moral
policing
usually
found
only
in
more
restive
corners
of
the
country
like
the
north
west
frontier
province
there
in
cities
much
closer
to
the
tribal
areas
where
many
militant
groups
are
based
music
stores
have
been
attacked
repeatedly
by
the
taliban
but
in
lahore
the
capital
of
punjab
province
the
music
and
video
market
on
hall
road
was
famous
for
the
sale
of
english
and
indian
movies
as
well
as
a
thriving
underground
trade
in
pornographic
movies
which
are
illegal
here
the
small
stores
in
dingy
clustered
plazas
had
attracted
buyers
for
more
than
two
decades
despite
repeated
crackdowns
and
warnings
the
police
had
been
unable
to
stop
the
trade
in
pornography
but
the
specter
of
the
taliban
achieved
in
a
day
what
the
police
had
been
unable
to
do
for
years
ahmad
rafay
alam
a
columnist
for
the
news
one
of
the
countrys
leading
daily
publications
wrote
afterward
that
the
talibanization
of
lahore
has
begun
i
was
very
surprised
said
moonis
elahi
a
member
of
the
provincial
assembly
referring
to
the
response
of
the
traders
who
he
said
were
less
concerned
about
making
a
stand
than
about
saving
their
livelihoods
the
traders
wanted
to
pacify
the
extremists
he
said
since
then
the
lingering
threat
of
bomb
blasts
and
suicide
attacks
continues
to
sow
fear
though
many
of
the
letters
and
the
calls
have
proved
to
be
hoaxes
elahi
said
a
close
friend
was
so
fed
up
with
threats
to
a
school
that
his
child
attended
that
he
was
contemplating
a
move
to
dubai
in
the
united
arab
emirates
police
officials
however
dismissed
the
concerns
of
talibanization
as
overblown
and
played
down
the
threats
in
our
assessment
the
letter
was
a
hoax
said
pervez
rathore
the
police
chief
of
lahore
it
was
a
local
mischief
in
addition
to
fear
the
hall
road
episode
has
exposed
fissures
in
society
in
lahore
between
the
citys
liberal
elite
and
the
conservative
impulses
of
its
working
and
middle
classes
some
of
whom
have
excused
or
supported
the
threats
and
the
traders
response
ejaz
haider
an
editor
at
daily
times
one
of
the
leading
englishlanguage
newspapers
said
the
burning
of
the
cds
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
hall
road
traders
had
become
reformed
muslims
overnight
it
just
showed
the
pragmatism
of
the
traders
he
said
khalil
rehman
chugtai
the
secretary
of
the
traders
union
of
hall
road
said
the
threats
were
in
fact
a
blessing
we
had
been
trying
to
eliminate
the
sales
of
porn
movies
for
long
with
no
luck
he
said
the
letter
helped
us
to
get
rid
of
them
chugtai
said
there
would
now
be
no
tolerance
for
the
sale
of
such
immoral
movies
a
few
days
after
the
bonfire
he
said
one
video
store
owner
was
found
selling
pornography
again
we
apprehended
him
blackened
his
face
and
paraded
him
through
the
market
he
said
saeed
ahmad
who
owns
a
juice
shop
near
the
three
that
were
attacked
last
month
even
defended
the
bomb
blasts
what
happened
was
for
the
better
he
said
they
didnt
just
serve
juices
there
immoral
acts
were
going
on
inside
the
cabins
set
up
by
the
owners
who
took
money
from
couples
still
raza
ahmad
rumi
a
writer
and
blogger
who
takes
great
pride
in
his
city
insisted
that
islamic
extremism
has
had
very
little
appeal
here
the
cultural
life
of
lahore
goes
on
as
it
has
for
centuries
he
said
that
a
recent
stage
play
hotel
moenjodaro
whose
theme
was
against
religious
fundamentalism
drew
a
packed
audience
it
was
very
encouraging
ahmad
said
nonetheless
he
said
the
hall
road
incident
and
the
juice
store
blasts
were
alarming
if
the
traders
the
merchant
class
which
forms
the
bulk
of
the
middle
class
of
lahore
becomes
talibanized
then
the
whole
complexion
of
the
city
will
change
he
said
thats
a
fear
amongst
the
secular
intelligentsia
and
elite
of
lahore
in
1967
after
several
years
of
research
a
young
market
forecaster
named
yale
hirsch
unveiled
a
grand
theory
of
the
relationship
between
presidential
elections
and
the
stock
market
tracking
data
back
to
1833
hirsch
found
that
on
average
stocks
performed
better
in
the
final
two
years
of
a
presidential
term
a
trend
he
attributed
to
maneuvering
by
the
party
in
power
to
better
its
chances
of
reelection
as
presidents
and
their
parties
get
anxious
about
holding
on
to
power
they
begin
to
prime
the
pump
in
the
third
year
fostering
bull
markets
prosperity
and
peace
reads
a
recent
edition
of
the
stock
traders
almanac
the
venerable
perennial
founded
by
hirsch
that
collects
financial
tidbits
gentle
market
humor
and
reams
of
historical
data
but
as
with
its
older
cousin
in
the
almanac
business
poor
richards
the
pattern
described
in
the
book
has
not
always
panned
out
with
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
down
30
percent
this
year
it
would
seem
2008
is
going
to
be
such
a
year
a
decline
so
startling
might
suggest
that
predicting
the
market
by
watching
american
election
patterns
is
not
a
practice
to
er
put
a
lot
of
stock
in
hirschs
theory
however
was
only
an
early
entry
in
a
long
tradition
of
market
watchers
seeking
connections
between
two
of
americas
favorite
pastimes
picking
presidents
and
picking
stocks
many
analysts
looking
for
a
jump
on
tuesdays
results
have
pointed
out
that
declines
in
the
stock
market
right
before
a
presidential
election
generally
point
to
an
advantage
for
the
challenging
party
investors
looking
to
make
a
quick
buck
this
week
can
dig
up
research
showing
that
stocks
tend
to
do
better
the
day
after
a
republican
presidential
victory
than
a
democratic
one
and
bullish
types
expecting
a
barack
obama
victory
have
noted
that
over
time
stocks
perform
better
under
democratic
administrations
or
perhaps
there
is
no
connection
at
all
without
doubt
declines
in
the
stock
market
can
signal
broader
problems
in
the
economy
and
the
performance
of
the
economy
influences
how
people
vote
but
to
forecast
the
market
based
on
a
political
event
is
to
enter
the
murky
realm
of
distinguishing
chance
correlations
from
true
cause
and
effect
to
me
things
like
the
weather
the
super
bowl
and
presidential
elections
are
basically
coincidental
said
laszlo
birinyi
jr
an
investment
adviser
and
head
of
birinyi
associates
in
westport
conn
i
would
never
consider
it
in
terms
of
investment
decisionmaking
he
said
you
will
find
people
who
will
wax
rhapsodically
on
it
but
quite
frankly
to
me
its
an
exercise
in
futility
with
stocks
facing
their
worst
declines
in
decades
this
year
may
be
particularly
difficult
to
predict
some
investors
say
the
problems
in
the
economy
are
so
farreaching
that
the
winner
of
the
election
could
in
the
shortterm
at
least
hardly
matter
at
all
the
amount
of
attention
being
paid
to
the
election
is
less
than
it
would
be
under
more
normal
circumstances
said
russ
koesterich
a
strategist
at
barclays
global
investors
right
now
people
are
still
focused
on
gaining
clarity
about
the
solvency
of
the
financial
sector
sharp
differences
divide
the
candidates
on
matters
like
tax
policy
and
government
regulation
and
their
proposals
could
eventually
be
enacted
into
law
but
birinyi
noted
that
campaign
speeches
are
far
removed
from
the
hurdles
and
compromises
of
capitol

the
process
of
legislative
government
is
so
long
and
drawn
out

isolate
the

the

is
to
me

try

investors
expect
the
market
to
stay
focused
on
the
problems
in
the
economy
including
the
credit
freeze
and

the

realizes
that
whoever

its
not
going

much
of
an

koesterich

despite
the
cautions

as

it

jeremy
j
siegel
a
professor
at
the
wharton
school
studied
presidential
election
cycles
for
his
1994
book
stocks
for
the
long
run
and
found
that
when
a
republican
wins
a
presidential
election
stocks
tend
to
perform
better
the
day
after
siegel
attributed
that
to
the
relatively
conservative
leanings
of
the
investor
class
the
first
flush
is
the
republicans
won
im
happy
he
said
but
once
it
plays
out
the
democrats
in
the
long
run
have
had
historically
better
returns
siegel
studied
stock
returns
from
1888
to
2004
from
monday
to
wednesday
of
presidential
election
weeks
stocks
moved
higher
by
an
average
of
07
percent
in
the
event
of
a
republican
victory
stocks
fell
05
percent
on
average
when
the
democrats
took
the
white
house
the
study
which
used
the
standard
ampamp
poors
index
as
a
gauge
comes
with
caveats
in
the
postwar
election
years
from
1948
to
2004
the
average
return
on
a
republican
victory
was
zero
while
stocks
dropped
02
percent
on
democratic
victories
stocks
also
tended
to
do
better
when
the
branches
of
government
were
divided
between
the
parties
with
the
best
performance
under
a
democratic
president
and
republican
congress
but
on
a
longer
time
scale
much
of
a
presidents
legacy

at
least
that
part
of
his
legacy
measured
by
the
dow
jones
industrial
average

has
really
been
determined
by
whether
markets
are
high
or
low
when
you
came
into
office
not
what
sorts
of
policies
you
bring
in
to
spark
it
up
siegel
said
and
what
of
hirschs
theory
of
presidential
elections
hirsch
declined
to
be
interviewed
but
his
son
jeffrey
who
has
taken
the
reins
of
the
business
defended
the
theory
the
advantage
of
the
cycle
is
it
works
most
of
the
time
and
it
provides
you
an
overarching
theme
as
to
when
most
of
the
markets
gains
and
losses
are
made
the
younger
hirsch
said
nothings
100
percent
perfect
he
added
its
not
something
used
in
a
vacuum
its
not
that
you
look
at
the
stars
and
the
calendar
and
only
follow
that
and
his
thoughts
for
2009
next
year
might
not
be
as
bad
or
conversely
theres
something
horrible
going
on
something
negative
in
this
global
crisis
which
could
mean
next
year
will
be
even
more
difficult
if
sen
john
mccain
defies
the
polls
and
wins
pennsylvania
it
will
be
in
part
because
of
voters
like
harry
klemash
67
a
democrat
who
supported
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
in
the
primary
and
is
still
not
comfortable
with
sen
barack
obama
obama
has
too
many
socialist
policies
and
he
doesnt
have
enough
experience
klemash
a
retired
pressman
said
sunday
as
he
walked
his
miniature
poodle
in
marconi
park
in
south
philadelphia
a
largely
white
catholic
ethnic
neighborhood
with
the
presidential
election
a
day
away
the
polls
point
to
an
obama
victory
in
pennsylvania
with
obama
holding
a
big
lead
in
philadelphia
but
the
polls
are
tightening
and
mccain
has
shown
no
signs
of
letting
up
in
the
state
as
the
republicans
try
to
map
situations
in
which
mccain
could
pull
off
an
upset
they
are
focusing
on
philadelphias
mostly
white
enclaves
im
spending
a

of

in

said
robert

referring

up
there
catholics
my
people
up
there
say
they
can
carry
four

six
wards
this
year
and
four
years
ago
they
carried
none
while
wealthier
whites
in
philadelphia
especially
in
center
city
overwhelmingly
support
obama
some
bluecollar
democrats
never
made
the
transition
from
supporting

said
shanin
specter
son
of
sen
arlen
specter
rpa
and
a
lawyer
who
is
steeped
in
local
politics
obama
is
likely
to
significantly
underperform
kerry
and
gore
in
those
white
rowhouse
wards
the
obama
campaign
is
fully
aware
of
the
challenge
this
is
a
tough
ward
said
paul
rossi
61
a
data
processor
who
lives
in
the
neighborhood
and
is
helping
out
at
an
obama
office
that
opened
saturday
not
far
from
marconi
park
its
a
matter
of
convincing
people
culturally
that
they
wont
be
harmed
by
obama
it
is
no
accident
that
sen
joe
biden
obamas
running
mate
is
being
dispatched
to
speak
in
marconi
park
on
monday
night
for
his
final
rally
of
the
campaign
the
white
bluecollar
catholics
here
are
just
the
kind
of
voters
whom
biden
also
catholic
was
chosen
to
help
win
over
biden
is
to
be
joined
by
members
of
the
philadelphia
phillies
who
just
won
the
world
series
susan
streicher
59
a
retired
secretary
and
registered
democrat
acknowledged
that
bidens
catholicism
was
appealing
to
her
but
said
she
preferred
mccain
and
gov
sarah
palin
mccains
running
mate
because
they
oppose
abortion
rights
her
husband
john
63
a
postal
worker
dismissed
mccain
saying
that
he
was
a
warmonger
and
that
alaska
palins
home
state
is
all
wilderness
both
said
they
thought
obama
would
win
there
is
no
doubt
that
obama
who
won
philadelphia
in
the
primary
will
sweep
the
city
again
but
while
it
is
a
major
part
of
the
statewide
puzzle
it
is
still
only
a
piece
in
2004
sen
john
kerry
the
democrat
won
about
80
percent
of
the
vote
in
philadelphia
beating
president
bush
by
412000
votes
here
but
kerry
won
the

by
only
144000
votes
gov
edward
g
rendell
of
pennsylvania
said
sunday
that
although
he
still
expected
obama
to
win
the
state
he
was
nervous
and
had
been
on
the
phone
screaming
at
chicago
meaning
the
obama
headquarters
to
send
reinforcements
hillary
clinton
is
due
in
pittsburgh
on
monday
former
president
bill
clinton
is
to
stump
for
obama
in
erie
and
elsewhere
the
same
day
mccain
continues
to
devote
his
most
precious
resource
his
time
to
pennsylvania
he
made
three
inperson
pleas
to
voters
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
state
over
the
weekend
and
planned
a
final
short
rally
for
monday
at
the
pittsburgh
airport
although
mccain
has
paid
scant
attention
to
philadelphia
gleason
the
republican
state
chairman
said
mccain
hoped
to
do
better
in
the
city
than
bush
did
and
the
party
has
begun
running
advertisements
highlighting
obamas
ties
to
the
rev
jeremiah
a
wright
jr
his
former
pastor
which
could
tap
into
concerns
among
white
voters
in
south
philadelphia
gleason
said
with
the
battle
between
the
africanamericans
and
all
the
other
wards
we
can
keep
obama
under
a
400000
margin
in
philadelphia
he
added
with
a
laugh
i
get
a
big
salary
to
be
positive
rendell
agreed
that
because
of
the
white
wards
obama
might
get
a
smaller
percentage
of
the
philadelphia
vote
than
kerry
did
perhaps
75
percent
instead
of
kerrys
80
percent
but
with
additional
democratic
registrations
he
said
and
a
bigger
turnout
obama
would
exceed
kerrys
numbers
in
addition
rendell
said
mccain
could
not
rely
on
the
republicans
deepest
well
in
the
state
which
until
1992
had
been
the
four
suburban
counties
around
philadelphia
rendell
and
gleason
agreed
that
montgomery
county
the
most
affluent
and
liberal
of
the
four
would
vote
for
obama
and
that
bucks
and
delaware
counties
were
also
likely
to
swing
for
him
the
fourth
chester
county
is
closely
contested
elsewhere
in
the
state
mccain
needs
a
big
turnout
in
central
pennsylvania
and
is
making
an
incursion

the

area

counterpoint

philadelphia
masone
and
her
friend
eileen
newman

who
works
in

and
lives

said
that
some
people
said
no

to
them
about

and
that
one
told
them
get
off
this
block
as
for
klemash
the
south
philadelphia
resident
he
said
he
was
ambivalent
about
mccain
too
mccain
is
too
close
to
bush
he
said
yet
he
admires
mccains
military
service
then
again
he
said
palin
was
a
bad
choice
as
mccains
running
mate
because
she
does
not
have
enough
experience
but
then
again
he
said
obama
does
not
have
enough
experience
either

the

hundreds

but
its
reach
is
broader
than

about
31
million
people
work
for
automakers

suppliers
and
their

in

every

said
sean

for
the
center
for
automotive
research
in
ann
arbor
two
of
the
five
are
related
to
suppliers

dealers
the
other
three
are
spinoff
jobs
at
businesses
where

the

is
better
than
any

offered

mcalinden
said
no
other

has
as
broad
and
significant
an
impact

even
with
the
restructuring
by

big
three
automakers
in
recent
years
that
has
closed

and
cost
tens
of
thousands

mcalinden
said
thats
why
michigan
politicians

leaders
auto
executives
and
governors
from
five
other

are
lobbying
for

the

any

mcalinden
said
the
resulting
drop
in

over

would
far
exceed
the
amount

dana
johnson
chief
economist
for

bank
in
dallas
johnson
paints
a
dramatically
different
picture
of
the
value
of
the
auto
industry
nationwide
saying
the
sector
accounts
for
less
than
1
percent
of
jobs
and
that
the
adage
of
whats

for

is
good
for
the

is
no
longer
the
case
it
is
good
for
michigan
and
select
states
he
said
but
not
the
us
as
a
whole
autos
are
a
key
sector
within
manufacturing
but
johnson
said
manufacturing
accounts
for
only
about
10
percent
of
american
jobs
compared
with
30
percent
decades
ago
i
dont
believe
the
auto
sector
deserves
special
consideration
johnson
said

bailing
out
financial
institutions
was
necessary
to
prevent
terrible
contagion
effects
that
could
collapse
the
economy
johnson
said
that
should
be
the
standard
to
argue
national
prosperity
depends
on
them
automakers
operating
to
me
is
much
more
of
a
stretch

eye
on

its

the
government
of
zimbabwe
led
by
president
robert
mugabe
spent
73
million
donated
by
an
international
organization
to
fight
killer
diseases
on
other
things
and
has
failed
to
honor
requests
to
return
the
money
according
to
the
organizations
inspector
general
the
actions
by
zimbabwe
have
deprived
the
organization
the
global
fund
to
fight
aids
tuberculosis
and
malaria
of
resources
it
needs
and
damaged
efforts
to
expand
lifesaving
treatment
said
the
inspector
general
john
parsons
zimbabwes
actions
also
jeopardize
a
more
ambitious
188
million
global
fund
grant
to
zimbabwe
due
for
consideration
by
the
funds
board
on
friday
parsons
said
the
global
fund
has
continued
to
demand
that
zimbabwe
return
the
money
and
global
fund
officials
say
zimbabwean
financial
officials
have
promised
to
do
so
by
thursday
but
parsons
said
zimbabwean
officials
also
said
they
had
not
repaid
the
money
because
they
did
not
have
enough
foreign
currency
the
breakdown
of
trust
between
the
global
fund
and
the
government
of
zimbabwe
comes
at
a
moment
of
widening
humanitarian
crisis
and
casts
further
doubt
on
the
willingness
of
western
donors
to
invest
heavily
in
rebuilding
the
economically
broken
nation
as
long
as
mugabe
is
in
charge
even
if
a
deadlock
over
a
powersharing
government
is
resolved
parsons
said
in
an
interview
on
sunday
that
last
year
the
global
fund
deposited
123
million
in
foreign
currency
into
zimbabwes
reserve
bank
he
declined
to
speculate
on
how
the
73
million
it
was
seeking
to
be
returned
had
been
spent
except
to
say
it
was
not
on
the
intended
purpose
civic
groups
and
opposition
officials
maintain
that
the
reserve
bank
helps
finance
mugabes
patronage
machine
parsons
did
offer
an
example
of
the
human
consequences
of
the
reserve
banks
failure
to
hand
over
the
money
for
disease
fighting
the
global
fund
has
brought
in
large
quantities
of
medicines
that
can
cure
malaria
but
has
been
able
to
finance
the
training
of
only
495
people
to
distribute
them
safely
instead
of
the
planned
27000
there
were
27
million
cases
of
malaria
among
zimbabwes
12
million
people
in
the
world
health
organizations
most
recent
estimates
the
drugs
expire
by
the
middle
of
next
year
and
it
would
be
criminal
if
we
cant
use
them
because
of
these
problems
parsons
said
theyve
got
quite
a
short
shelf
life
zimbabwes
information
minister
sikhanyiso
ndlovu
said
sunday
in
an
interview
that
he
was
not
aware
of
the
particulars
of
the
financial
disagreement
with
the
global
fund
but
he
defended
what
he
described
as
the
reserve
banks
good
intentions
and
accused
the
global
fund
of
politicizing
aid
they
always
want
to
put
certain
standards
and
concoct
certain
things
to
make
us
look
bad
and
horrendous
in
international
eyes
he
said
gideon
gono
governor
of
the
reserve
bank
the
custodian
of
the
global
funds
money
has
been
spending
large
sums
this
year
on
a
range
of
things
according
to
reports
in
zimbabwes
stateowned
media
gono
gave
the
countrys
judges
new
vehicles
satellite
dishes
and
televisions
and
allocated
79
vehicles
for
the
information
ministry
he
announced
the
provision
of
3000
tractors
105
combine
harvesters
and
100000
plows
for
the
countrys
farm
mechanization
program
ndlovu
the
information
minister
said
the
reserve
bank
had
been
getting
foreign
currency
for
imports
of
food
and
medicine
ndlovu
said
the
global
fund
had
sided
with
western
nations
that
had
restricted
aid
to
zimbabwe
and
imposed
sanctions
on
it

sanctions
that
mugabe
and
his
party
blame
for
the
countrys
economic
ruin
the
money
from
the
global
fund
is
nowhere
near
what
the
reserve
bank
has
spent
on
health
care
for
the
country
the
information
minister
said
civic
groups
and
opposition
officials
contend
that
gono
and
the
reserve
bank
have
helped
finance
the
governing
partys
patronage
operation
essential
to
mugabes
hold
on
power
for
the
past
28
years
eddie
cross
a
senior
official
in
the
opposition
movement
for
democratic
change
accused
the
reserve
bank
of
looting
the
global
funds
donation
international
aid
groups
and
un
agencies
say
the
countrys
annual
inflation
rate
of
more
than
230
million
percent
and
rules
imposed
by
the
reserve
bank
have
severely
complicated
the
logistics
of
helping
the
most
impoverished
people
the
reserve
bank
suspended
electronic
banking
a
month
ago
making
it
impossible
for
international
organizations
to
pay
for
goods
and
services
with
bank
transfers
the
reserve
bank
has
also
severely
limited
cash
withdrawals
from
commercial
banks
and
the
inflation
rate
has
rendered
check
payments
nearly
worthless
by
the
time
they
clear

later
more
than
20
aid
groups
donor
countries
and

wrote
gono
last

asking
that
electronic
banking
be
restored
for
humanitarian
aid
purposes
and
that
they
be
allowed
to
pay
service
providers
in
foreign
currency
if
agencies
are
increasingly
unable
to
pay
for
their
field
operations
they
wrote
that
inability
will
greatly
increase
the
already
substantial
suffering
of
those
zimbabweans
who
are
most
in
need
of
humanitarian
response
a
third
of
zimbabwes
population
of
12
million
is
now
hungry
and
in

the

a
million
children
have
lost
one
or
both
parents
about
140000

there
last

mugabes
government
banned
the
work
of
international
aid
groups
for
almost
three
months
during
the
election
season
earlier
this
year
accusing
them
of
backing
the
political
opposition
the
ban
was
lifted
on
aug
29
two
months
after
mugabe
was
declared
the
victor
in
a
discredited
presidential
runoff
election
his
main
rival
the
opposition
leader
morgan
tsvangirai
dropped
out
of
the
race
citing
statesponsored
violence
against
his
supporters
it
has
taken
time
for
the
aid
groups
to
resume
their
work
one
major
humanitarian
group
which
declined
to
be
identified
by
name
for
fear
of
retaliation
against
its
staff
by
government
officials
said
it
would
be
able
to
get
food
only
to
half
as
many
people
as
originally
planned
this
month
because
of
the
difficulties
of
paying
for
its
logistical
operations
the
zimbabwe
office
of
the
un
childrens
fund
which
coordinates
one
of
the
worlds
largest
programs
for
orphans
decided
friday
that
it
could
no
longer
pay
the
local

it
supported
there
by
check
seriously
hampering
its
ability
to
help
the
most
vulnerable

the

that
the

rose
from
3

on

then
to

we

officials
have
told
the

they
do
not

they

abdullah

that

though

the

began
scouting

here
in
april
and
returned
in
june
ultimately
choosing
detroit
over
a
short
list
of
four
other
cities
the
original
plan
was
to
have
greektown
stand
in
for
new

though
the
script
was
eventually
rejiggered
to
take

in

thats
why
the

originally
titled

on
bourbon
street
is
currently
untitled
and
using
the
working
title
american

i
hate
shooting

location
for
another
so
i
thought
this
is
detroit
lets
embrace
it
says
kilner
how
to
deal
the
wedding
date
during

last

at

its
a
fascinating

theres
lots
of
local
color
and
texture
weve
had
some
great
locations
and
its
serving
us
really
well
several
street
scenes
were
filmed
last

including
an
oktoberfest

on
the
main
strip
in
greektown
on
monroe

between
beaubien

he
was
serenaded
with
a
you

from
a
local
passerby
and
he
groused
halfkiddingly
ive
never
heard
that
schneider
who
joked
hes
approachable
because
hes
the
same
size
on
tv
as
he
is
in
person
praised
the
work
of
the
local
extras
in
la
they
could
yawn
if
they
see
tom

walking
down

but
here
people
are
really
excited
they
couldnt
have
been
nicer
sex
and
sexuality
the
film
deals
frankly
with
sex
and
sexuality
but
the
filmmakers
say
tries
not
to
take
a
hardline
stance
on
the

who

and
davis
naz
opens
the
film
engaged
in
a
foursome
yet
the
filmmakers
say
the
movie
tries
not
to
judge
either
of
them
id
hate
for
a
film
to
be
judgmental
or
come
across
with
a
moral
position
but
i
guess
my
point
of
view
is
anything
extreme
is
kind
of
repressing
in
some
way
says
englandborn
director
kilner
women
are
in
charge
of
their
sexuality
and
celebrating
it
but
theres
a
fine
line
between
celebrating
it
and
making
your
own
choices
and
being
exploited
and
this
is
what
this
film
explores
davis
who
plays
the
party
gal
says
the
films
message
is
simple
be
who
you
are
not
what
people
want
you
to
be
not
a
trend
or
a
part
of
a
movement
just
who
you
are
all
of
which
seems
like
a
surprising
amount
of
depth
for
a
film
where
the
prop
department
worked
up
a
license
plate
that
reads
c
boobz
schneider

whose
character
is
loosely
modeled
after
girls
gone
wilds
partyboy
troublemaker
and
founder
joe
francis
and
is
revealed
to
be
a
father
with
a
daughter
the
same
age
as
the
girls
who
populate
his
videos

says
the
film
is
about
balance
v
theres
these
women
who
take
the
vow
of
chastity
and
then
theres
the
other
extreme
thats
not
appreciating
the
specialness
of
that
part
of
the
human
behavior
that
is
beautiful
and
special
i
hope
we
dont
show
one
side
is
crazier
than
the
other
side
he
says
i
hope
people
see
the
movie
and
i
hope
its
entertaining
but
if
they
come
away
with
something
i
hope
they
see
there
should
be
a
balance
and
sexuality
shouldnt
be
such
a

the

down
a
request
by

for
up

10
billion
to

finance
the
automakers
possible
merger
with

according
to
people
close
to
the
discussions
instead
of
providing
new
assistance
the
treasury
department
told
gm
on
friday
the
bush
administration
will
now
shift
its
focus
to
speeding
up
the
25
billion
loan
program
for
fuelefficient
vehicles
approved
by
congress
in
september
and
administered
by
the
energy
department
treasury
officials
were
said
to
be
reluctant
to
broaden
the
700
billion
financial
rescue
program
to
include
industrial
companies
or
to
play
a
part
in
a
gmchrysler
merger
that
could
cost
tens
of
thousands
of
jobs
but
it
remained
unclear
whether
the
officials
were
also
seeking
to
avoid
making
any
decision
that
would
conflict
with
the
goals
of
a
new
presidential
administration
the
democratic
candidate
sen
barack
obama
has
said
in
recent
days
that
he
supports
increasing
aid
to
the
troubled
auto
companies
while
sen
john
mccain
has
not
said
whether
he
would
support
aid
beyond
the
25
billion
while
gm
and
chrysler
continue
to
talk
no
deal
is
expected
until
the
government
clarifies
its
role
if
any
potential
investors
in
the
deal
have
been
hesitant
to
back
the
merger
without
federal
assistance
gms
chairman
rick
wagoner
had
lobbied
treasury
secretary
henry
m
paulson
jr
to
provide
emergency
aid
to
the
auto
companies
under
the
bailout
program
to
stabilize
the
financial
markets
the
bush
administration
is
still
considering
a
range
of
options
to
aid
the
detroit
automakers
which
are
losing
billions
of
dollars
and
rapidly
depleting
their
cash
reserves
said
auto
industry
and
administration
officials
who
did
not
want
to
be
identified
because
of
the
sensitive
nature
of
the
discussions
the
first
step
is
to
get
the
energy
department
to
expedite
the
release
of
the
25
billion
in
lowinterest
loans
for
gm
chrysler
and
the
ford
motor

with
auto
sales
deteriorating
to
their
lowest
level
in
15
years
detroits
traditional

support
for
aiding
the
industry
is
growing
among
political
leaders
in
states
with
heavy
automotive
employment
last
week
the
governors
of
michigan

wrote
a
letter
to
paulson

the

urging
immediate
action
to

the

the
depth
of

problems
will
become
even
more
evident
this

with
the
release
of
october

announcements
by
gm

ford
her
crowds
are
smaller
now
and
most
of
the
reporters
are
gone
the
campaign
posters
say
his
name
not
hers
and
instead
of
championing
her
ideas
for
health
insurance
or
tax
relief
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
is
giving
out
1800
numbers
and
internet
addresses
for
sen
barack
obamas
campaign
watching
clinton
campaign
for
her
old
rival
masking
what
friends
say
is
lingering
disappointment
it
is
easy
to
recall
happier
days
while
she
often
said
during
her
17month
race
that
it
took
a
clinton
to
clean
up
after
a
bush
she
has
now
tweaked
that
line
a
bit
it
took
a
democratic
president
to
clean
up
after
the
first
president
bush
she
said
to
cheers
at
a
rally
here
on
saturday
in
the
political
battleground
of
central
florida
it
will
take
a
democratic
president
to
clean
up
after
the
next
president
bush
moments
later
she
made
another
comment
that
echoed
a
clinton
campaign
advertisement
that
ran
on
the
eve
of
the
pennsylvania
primary
in
which
clinton
warned
voters
not
to
take
a
leap
of
faith
with
obama
to
protect
the
country
but
for
the
crowd
in
winter
park
clinton
had
this
to
say
im
not
asking
anyone
to
take
a
leap
of
faith
im
just
saying
look
at
the
evidence
arguing
that
obamas
economic
proposals
were
far
better
than
mccains
the
bitterness
of
that
long
primary
battle
however
is
the
last
thing
that
obama
supporters
brought
up
about
clinton
in
florida
last
weekend
of
20
interviewed
all
effusively
praised
her
all
20
said
that
if
obama
won
they
hoped
that
she
would
be
his
secretary
of
state
or
that
she
would
shepherd
his
health
care
or
energy
bills
through
the
senate
all
20
said
they
hoped
she
would
run
for
president
again
i
would
have
supported
her
this
year
if
not
for
her
vote
for
the
iraq
war
and
the
fact
that
she
never
said
it
was
a
mistake
said
jocelyn
bartkevicius
a
democrat
and
writer
and
editor
who
attended
the
rally
here
but
she
has
been
so
strong
for
obama
this
fall
such
a
good
sport
i
wouldnt
hold
a
longterm
grudge
id
be
with
her
next
time
for
the
friends
and
allies
already
thinking
about
clintons
political
future
the
possibility
of
a
victory
by
sen
john
mccain
on
tuesday
would
upend
an
array
of
assumptions
not
least
of
which
that
clinton

if
she
were
to
run
again

would
not
do
so
until
2016
when
she
would
be
turning
69
at
the
same
time
under
a
mccain
presidency
clinton
could
be
well
positioned
given
her
friendship
with
him
and
good
standing
among
washington
republicans
to
help
him
with
a
democraticled
congress
on
alternative
energy
which
they
have
both
highlighted
on
the
campaign
trail
while
clintons
high
profile
in
democratic
politics
has
been
fortified
by
her
work
for
obama
her
friends
say
it
is
too
soon
to
say
what
the
future
holds
for
her
for
one
thing
they
say
she
is
not
over
her
primary
loss
some
days
it
is
hard
for
her
even
a
little
heartbreaking
to
campaign
for
obama
given
how
much
she
wanted
to
be
president
others
say
that
she
is
being
a
good
soldier
because
she
wants
to
be
a
power
player
in
washington
if
obama
wins
but
that
she
is
not
sure
what
her
role
might
be
she
is
a
human
being
said
jill
iscol
a
good
friend
and
former
supporter
of
clinton
shes
a
real
person
and
so
she
has
her
feelings
but
what
matters
to
her
most
right
now
is
making
sure
obama
wins
clinton
told
fox
news
last
month
that
there
was
probably
zero
chance
of
her
becoming
senate
majority
leader
several
senate
democratic
aides
concur
noting
that
many
of
her
colleagues
supported
obama
for
president
asked
about
the
chances
that
she
would
run
again
for
president
she
said
probably
close
to
zero
the
question
was
not
predicated
on
whether
obama
would
win
or
lose
on
tuesday
supreme
court
nominee
zero
she
said
i
have
no
interest
in
doing
that
while
clinton
still
has
a
campaign
debt
of
several
million
dollars
she
has
been
steadily
raising
money
for
her
political
action
committee
which
advisers
say
could
become
a
means
to
champion
womens
issues
clinton
won
about
17
million
votes
in
her
presidential
primary
campaign
and
by
all
accounts
she
will
emerge
on
election
day
as
a
respected
force
in
the
eyes
of
not
only
her
allies
but
also
of
people
around
obama
for
whom
she
has
raised
several
million
dollars
and
done
more
than
75
rallies
fundraisers
conference
calls
and
other
tasks
its
one
of
those
times
where
she
has
won
by
losing
in
a
very
real
sense
said
sen
charles
e
schumer
her
democratic
colleague
from
new
york
whether
people
were
with
her
like
i
was
or
not
with
her
i
think
everyones
respect
for
her
in
the
senate
has
gone
up
in
the
way
she
has
handled
herself
since
the
end
of
the
race
over
the
long
term
some
political
allies
believe
that
clinton
would
be
a
strong
choice
to
lead
the
democratic
senatorial
campaign
committee
in
2010
given
her
fundraising
contacts
her
eye
for
political
talent
and
her
proven
ability
to
raise
money
for
the
party
she
has
raised
several
million
dollars
for
obama
and
helped
several
senate
candidates
this
year
schumer
also
led
the
senatorial
committee
in
2006
he
said
he
would
not
think
until
after
tuesday
about
doing
it
again
some
advisers
to
clinton
said
that
the
idea
was
intriguing
but
that
they
did
not
know
how
she
felt
about
it
she
declined
to
be
interviewed
for
this
article
in
the
near
term

the
first
year
of
the
next
presidential
administration

several
associates
said
she
would
like
to
be
an
ally
of
the
white
houses
next
occupant
whoever
that
is
for
a
president
obama
her
favorite
clinton
advisers
say
she
might
be
positioned
to
be
a
point
person
on
his
proposal
for
expanding
access
to
health
insurance
or
for
his
energy
plan
two
issues
that
she
and
obama
promoted
during
the
primaries
her
hand
in
health
care
depends
largely
her
advisers
say
on
sen
edward
m
kennedy
given
his
experience
with
health
care
issues
and
his
seniority
kennedy
has
been
in
the
senate
for
46
years
clinton
for
8
and
she
does
not
hold
a
committee
chairmanship
where
real
power
resides
kennedy
has
been
battling
cancer
and
many
washington
democrats
believe
that
he
will
be
too
ill
to
carry
a
major
legislative
program
but
clinton
like
other
democrats
would
defer
to
him
for
a
president
mccain
on
the
other
hand
clinton
might
be
an
emissary
between
his
white
house
and
a
democraticled
congress
she
has
done
more
for
obama
than
dean
did
in
2004
for
kerry
more
than
bradley
did
for
gore
in
2000
more
than
kennedy
did
for
carter
in
1980
said
james
a
thurber
the
director
of
the
center
for
congressional
and
presidential
studies
at
american
university
in
washington
dc
as
much
as
this
must
hurt
her
she
has
been
the
ultimate
trooper
this
fall
after
years
of
unfettered
growth
in
military
budgets
defense
department
planners
top
commanders
and
weapons
manufacturers
now
say
they
are
almost
certain
that
the
financial
meltdown
will
have
a
serious
impact
on
future
pentagon
spending
across
the
military
services
deep
apprehension
has
led
to
closeddoor
meetings
and
detailed
calculations
in
anticipation
of
potential
cuts
civilian
and
military
budget
planners
say
that
they
are
already
analyzing
worstcase
contingency
spending
plans
that
would
see
their
overall
budgets
frozen
or
slashed
the
obvious
targets
for
savings
would
be
expensive
new
arms
programs
which
have
racked
up
cost
overruns
of
at
least
300
billion
for
the
top
75
weapons
systems
according
to
the
government
accountability
office
congressional
budget
experts
say
likely
targets
for
reductions
are
the
armys
plans
for
fielding
advanced
combat
systems
the
air
forces
joint
strike
fighter
the
navys
new
destroyer
and
the
groundbased
missile
defense
system
even
before
the
crisis
on
wall
street
senior
pentagon
officials
were
anticipating
little
appetite
for
growth
in
military
spending
after
seven
years
of
war
but
the
question
of
how
to
pay
for
national
security
now
looms
as
a
significant
challenge
for
the
next
president
at
a
time
when
the
pentagons
annual
base
budget
for
standard
operations
has
reached
more
than
500
billion
the
highest
level
since
world
war
ii
when
adjusted
for
inflation
on
top
of
that
figure
supplemental
spending
for
the
wars
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
has
topped
100
billion
each
year
frustrating
republicans
as
well
as
democrats
in
congress
in
all
the
defense
department
now
accounts
for
half
of
the
governments
total
discretionary
spending
and
pentagon
and
military
officials
fear
it
could
be
the
choice
for
major
cuts
to
pay
the
rest
of
the
governments
bills
on
the
presidential
campaign
trail
sens
john
mccain
and
barack
obama
have
pledged
to
cut
fat
without
carving
into
the
muscle
of
national
security
both
have
said
they
would
protect
the
overall
level
of
military
spending
and
mccain
has
further
pledged
to
add
more
troops
to
the
roster
of
the
armed
services
beyond
the
92000
now
advocated
by
the
pentagon
an
increase
endorsed
by
obama
some
critics
citing
the
increase
in
military
spending
since
sept
11
2001
say
it
would
be
much
easier
to
cut
military
spending
than
programs
like
social
security
and
medicare
at
a
time
when
most
peoples
retirement
savings
are
dwindling
because
of
the
financial
crisis
rep
barney
frank
dmass
the
chairman
of
the
house
financial
services
committee
has
raised
the
idea
of
reducing
military
spending
by
25
percent
at
the
pentagon
senior
officials
have
taken
up
the
mission
of
urging
sustained
military
spending
adm
mike
mullen
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
has
asked
congress
and
the
nation
to
pledge
at
least
4
percent
of
the
gross
domestic
product
to
the
military
and
defense
secretary
robert
m
gates
has
warned
against
repeating
historic
trends
in
which
the
nation
cut
money
for
the
armed
services
after
a
period
of
warfare
we
basically
gutted
our
military
after
world
war
i
after
world
war
ii
in
certain
ways
after
korea
certainly
after
vietnam
and
after
the
end
of
the
cold
war
gates
said
experience
is
the
ability
to
recognize
a
mistake
when
you
make
it
again
gates
acknowledges
that
military
spending
is
almost
certain
to
level
off
and
he
expressed
a
goal
that
the
pentagon
budget
at
least
keep
pace
with
inflation
over
coming
years
apprehension
over
potential
budget
cuts
has
trickled
down
the
pentagon
bureaucracy
to
those
who
draft
the
militarys
annual
spending
proposals
if
thats
what
they
want
they
have
to
know
that
we
simply
cannot
do
everything
we
are
doing
now
but
for
less
money
said
one
pentagon
budget
officer
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
for
attribution
so
if
theres
going
to
be
less
its
up
to
the
president
congress
and
the
public
to
tell
us
what
part
of
our
national
security
mission
we
should
stop
carrying
out
much
of
the
pentagon
budget
pays
for
personnel
costs
which
are
difficult
to
cut
at
any
time
particularly
while
troops
are
risking
their
lives
in
combat
obama
has
said
his
plan
to
begin
drawing
down
american
forces
from
iraq
would
ease
a
wartime
taxpayer
burden
that
now
totals
more
than
10
billion
a
month
but
budget
analysts
at
the
pentagon
and
on
capitol
hill
say
that
even
troop
reductions
in
iraq

whether
at
the
cautious
pace
laid
out
by
president
bush
and
endorsed
by
mccain
or
at
the
more
rapid
pace
prescribed
by
obama

would
present
only
small
savings
in
the
first
years
moving
tens
of
thousands
of
troops
and
their
heavy
equipment
home
from
the
persian
gulf
region
is
a
costly
undertaking
and
housing
at
stateside
bases
is
more
expensive
than
in
the
war
zone
so
savings
would
be
seen
only
in
subsequent
years
calls
by
both
presidential
candidates
to
shift
troops
from
iraq
to
afghanistan
would
add
costs
to
the
pentagon
budget
according
to
military
planners
and
congressional
budget
experts
it
is
significantly
more
expensive
to
sustain
each
soldier
in
afghanistan
than
in
iraq
because
of
afghanistans
landlocked
location
and
primitive
road
network
the
federal
budget
is
due
to
congress
in
february
but
that
document
is
expected
to
be
little
more
than
an
outline
arriving
soon
after
inauguration
day
congressional
officials
predict
the
new
president
will
require
several
months
to
put
his
imprint
on
a
detailed
spending
plan
on
the
campaign
trail
obama
has
said
he
would
initially
maintain
overall
military
spending
at
current
levels
obama
has
made
it
very
clear
that
he
doesnt
see
how
the
defense
budget
can
be
cut
now
given
the
commitments
we
have
said
f
whitten
peters
a
former
air
force
secretary
now
advising
obama
on
national
security
policies
his
sense
is
that
there
is
not
money
to
be
cut
from
the
defense
budget
in
the
near
term
but
in
looking
to
future
pentagon
budgets
it
is
clear
that
all
the
weapons
programs
cannot
fit
he
added
so
he
continued
youre
going
to
have
to
make
some
hard
decisions
mccain
a
former
navy
combat
pilot
who
was
taken
prisoner
during
the
war
in
vietnam
is
known
for
taking
on
what
he
has
seen
as
wasteful
pentagon
spending
according
to
one
of
his
advisers
on
military
policy
mccain
feels
very
strongly
that
the
whole
procurement
process
is
totally
dysfunctional
he
believes
that
putting
order
discipline
and
accountability
back
into
the
process
will
stop
the
goldplating
and
bring
costs
down
said
the
adviser
who
asked
not
to
be
named
in
order
to
discuss
the
candidates
views
frankly
these
budget
pressures
also
seem
quite
likely
to
add
to
the
tensions
between
congress
and
the
pentagon
over
the
best
balance
between
supporting
the
troops
fighting
insurgencies
and
developingweapons
that
might
be
needed
in
larger
wars
i
think
we
need
a
complete
review
of
this
whole
thing
said
rep
neil
abercrombie

of

you
cannot
make
a
case
for
undermining
the
readiness
of
the
army
and
the
marines
in
the
circumstances
that
we
face
today
with
a
commitment
of
so
much
money
to
weapons
systems
that
are
at
best
abstract
and
theoretical
executives
at
the
leading
defense
contractors
say
they
realize
that
the
pentagons
spending
is
likely
to
be
more
restrained
boeings

recently
wrote
in
a
note
to
his
employees
no
one
really
yet
knows
when
or
to
what
extent
defense
spending
could
be
affected
but
its
unrealistic
to
think
there
wont
be
some
measure
of
impact
ronald

the

told

but
sugar
added
clearly
the
pressures
are
going
to
increase
in

a
number
of
scholars
who
have
examined
the
subject
including
david
c
hendrickson
a
political
scientist
at

college
predict
that
defense
will
not
prove
to
be
recessionproof
serious
savings
could
be
had
by
reducing
force
structure
and
limiting
modernization
said
hendrickson
who
posted
a
blogbook
on
the
financial
crisis
at
pictorialguidetocrisisblogspotcom
though
american
power
has
weakened
on
every
count
there
is
no
reconsideration
of
objectives
defining
a
coherent
philosophy
in
foreign
affairs
and
defense
strategy
that
is
respectful
of
limits
is
vital
other
analysts
like
loren
b
thompson
of
the
lexington
institute
a
policy
research
center
say
that
weapons
spending
will
be
fiercely
defended
by
many
in
congress
and
their
allies
in
the
weapons
industry
as
a
way
to
stimulate
the
economy
buying
new
armaments
and
repairing
wornout
weapons
thompson
said
protects

hirsch
found
that

years
of
a

a
trend
he
attributed

better

the

based
in

thickly

around
here
seem
stronger
than
ever
when
congo
shakes
africa
trembles
this
vast
linchpin
of
a
country
at
the
green
heart
of
the
continent
covering
905000
square
miles
and
bordering
nine
nations
never
goes
down
alone
when
the
congolese
state
began
to
collapse
in
1996
it
set
off
a
regional
war
when
it
imploded
again
in
1998
it
dragged
in
armies
from
a
halfdozen
other
african
countries
the
two
wars
and
the
mayhem
since
have
killed
possibly
5
million
people
a
death
toll
that
human

groups
say
is
the
worst
related
to
any
conflict
since

ii
the
worry
now
is
that
congo
is
on
the
brink
again
with
neighbors
poised
to
jump
in
which
is
why
the
relatively
smallscale
bush
fighting
last
week
attracted
some
of
the
most
intense
diplomatic
activity
congo
has
seen
in
years
the
french
foreign
minister
the
british
foreign

top
un

and
the
state
departments
highest
official
for
africa
all
jetted
in
to
the
decrepit
but
important
lakeside
city
of
goma
the
hills
around
goma
are
now
firmly
in
rebel
hands
after
rebel
fighters
routed
the
congolese
army
late
last
month
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
an
eleventhhour
ceasefire
declared
by
the
rebels
goma
itself
would
now
be
theirs
the
political
damage
this
has
caused
is
enormous

john

a

said
it
is
remarkable
that
14
years
after
the

in

un
peacekeeping
remains
as
ineffectual
at
protecting
civilians
as
it
was
then

never

alan
doss
the
head
of
the
un

in

said
it
had
been
very
difficult
to
defend
the
perimeter
of
goma
and
at
the
same
time
police
the
streets
with
a
relatively
small
force

were
certainly
stretched
he
said
theres
only
so
much
we
can
do
the
european

of
sending
more
troops
but
right
now
the
emphasis
seems
to
be
on
forging
a
durable
political
settlement
with
the
rebels
the
trick
is
that
eastern
congo
has
always
been
a
headache
to
rule
and
the
rebels
based
in
the
thickly
forested
hills
around
here
seem
stronger
than
ever
they
are
led
by
a
charismatic
troublemaker
laurent
nkunda
who
commands
a
welltrained
wellequipped
guerrilla
army
from
an
abandoned
belgian
farmhouse
in
the
jungle
he
is
an
ethnic
tutsi
and
congolese
officials
have
painted
nkunda
a
renegade
general
as
a
pawn
of
tutsiled
rwanda
next
door
though
it
is
unclear
how
actively
rwanda
might
be
supporting
nkunda
rwandan
meddling
here
would
be
far
from
unprecedented
congo
has
suffered
a
long
history
of
exploitation
going
back
to
the
belgian
colonial
times
various
rebel
groups
and
foreign
forces
have
annexed
large
swaths
of
the
country
to
extract
gold
diamonds
tin
and
timber
at
times
too
the
congolese
government
has
invited
its
neighbors
in
trying
to
find
defenders
at
critical
moments
just
a
few
days
ago
for
example
the
government
urged
its
old
friend
angola
to
send
troops
back
into
congo
as
angola
did
in
1998
to
counter
nkundas
rebellion
and
a
perceived
rwandan
menace
villagers
near
goma
said
last
week
that
they
had
seen
uniformed
rwandan
soldiers
fighting
alongside
nkundas
men
and
that
the
rwandans
had
burned
homes
and
killed
children
i
saw
them
come
over
the
border
with
my
own
eyes
said
jackson
busisi
a
farmer
rwanda
denies
all
this
congo
analysts
say
that
nkunda
may
have
some
legitimate
political
goals

and
congolese
ones
at
that
for
starters
he
seems
determined
to
eliminate
the
hutu
death
squads
who
participated
in
the
massacre
of
800000
people
in
rwanda
in
1994
and
then
fled
into
congo
where
they
continue
to
brutalize
with
impunity
the
congolese
government
has
promised
to
disarm
the
squads
but
the
rebels

and
many
western
diplomats

say
the
government
is
actually
giving
the
hutu
death
squads
guns
the
congolese
army
is
working
hand
in
hand
with
these
killers
said
babu
amani
a
spokesman
for
the
rebels
the
rebels
want
to
play
a
bigger
role
in
governing
eastern
congo
and
even
possibly
to
carve
the
territory
into
ethnic
fiefs
nkunda
has
recently
been
reaching
out
to
hutus
and
it
seems
that
he
is
trying
to
refashion
himself
into
a
leader
for
all
rwandanspeaking
people
in
the
eastern
congo
province
of
north
kivu
where
rwandan
speakers
make
up
about
40
percent
of
the
population
and
dominate
many
of
the
important
businesses
but
nkundas
ambitions
may
go
beyond
even
that
across
the
country
congolese
are
getting
fed
up
with
their
president
joseph
kabila
who
has
little
to
show
after
winning
a
historic
election
in
2006
congos
first
nationwide
democratic
vote
since
independence
in
1960
the
top
opposition
leader
jeanpierre
bemba
a
former
vice
president
has
been
in
jail
in
the
hague
in
recent
months
facing
international
war
crimes
charges
in
connection
with
bloodshed
and
mass
rapes
in
the
central
african
republic
five
years
ago
this
may
be
an
irresistible
opportunity
for
nkundas
rebel
troops
the
national
congress
for
the
defense
of
the
people
or
cndp
to
forge
opportunistic
alliances
with
other
dissident
groups
and
possibly
try
to
push
kabila
out
cndp
has
the
brains
the
money
the
muscle
and
the
determination
to
achieve
it
said
a
western
analyst
who
works
on
congo
issues
and
said
he
would
speak
only
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
his
job
the
other
side
has
none
of
the
above
this
may
explain
why
nkunda
paused
last
week
right
at
the
doorstep
of
goma
without
walking
in
he
showed
that
he
was
powerful
and
that
the
government
was
weak
he
avoided
dealing
with
the
mess
of
occupying
a
major
city
especially
when
the
united
nations
had
urged
him
to
stay
out
in
the
end
he
obtained
the
leverage
he
needed
for
future
negotiations
without
sustained
fighting
or
damage
to
his
reputation
a
meeting
has
now
been
called
between
rwanda
and
congo
aid
organizations
are
urging
the
united
states
to
put
more
pressure
on
rwanda
its
ally
to
rein
in
nkunda
diplomats
are
shuttling
between
congo
and
rwanda
trying
to
get
the
two
sides
to
focus
on
peace
treaties
they
have
already
signed
so
another
regional
war
does
not
break
out
there
will
be
a
summit
vlassenroot
said
and
there
will
be
a
nice
document
coming
out
of
it
but
it
wont
change
anything
what
congo
needs
he
said
is
a
true
change
of
culture
that
would
end
the
long
tradition
of
corruption
and
criminally
inept
government
and
the
attendant
rebellions
given
the
decades
of
unending
crisis
here
no
one
sees
that
happening
anytime
soon
during
its
long
history
an

served
as
a
shelter
for

been
gutted

recently

also
where
actress

spent
her

valuable
it

stone
said
the

could
tie
in
with
the

signature
event
the
lancaster
poppy
festival
and
the
fact
that
many
films
have
been
shot
in
the
antelope

weve
got
the
states
only
poppy

those
two
things
would
tie
in
beautifully
with

the
potential

the

big
in

these
six

on
sunday
we
are
competing
now
in
districts
george
bush
carried
by
large
margins
in
2004
what
seems
especially
striking
about
this
years
congressional
races
is
that
democrats
appear
to
have
solidified
their
gains
from
the
2006
midterm
elections
and
are
pushing
beyond
their
traditional
urban
turf
into
what
once
were
safe
republican
strongholds
creating
a
struggle
for
the
suburbs
trying
to
capitalize
on
economic
uncertainty
house
democrats
are
taking
aim
at
vacant
seats
and
incumbents
in
suburban
and
even
more
outlying
areas

the
traditional
foundation
of
republican
power
in
the
house
with
many
of
the
most
contested
house
races
occurring
in
republicanheld
districts
that
extend
beyond
cities
in
states
like
florida
michigan
minnesota
and
ohio
democrats
said
expected
victories
would
give
them
suburban
dominance
the
same
is
true
for
senate
democratic
candidates
who
are
seeking
to
nail
down
swing
counties
outside
urban
centers
and
move
the
party
toward
a
60vote
majority
that
majority
could
overcome
a
filibuster
if
party
leaders
could
hold
the
votes
together
among
open
house
seats
democrats
say
they
have
a
good
chance
of
capturing
include
those
being
vacated
by
rep
john
r
kuhl
jr
in
new
york
ralph
regula
and
deborah
pryce
in
ohio
jim
ramstad
in
minnesota
jerry
weller
in
illinois
and
rick
renzi
in
arizona
incumbents
democrats
believe
they
can
defeat
include
rep
joe
knollenberg
in
michigan
tom
feeney
and
ric
keller
in
florida
don
young
in
alaska
robin
hayes
in
north
carolina
and
bill
sali
in
idaho
democrats
say
they
have
been
able
to
peel
away
suburbanites
by
emphasizing
republican
culpability
for
the
economic
decline
a
point
they
say
house
republicans
helped
make
themselves
by
initially
balking
at
the
700
billion
bailout
and
sending
the
markets
into
a
tailspin
that
depleted
retirement
and
college
savings
accounts
suburban
voters
are
angry
that
their
quality
of
life
and
standard
of
living
is
under
attack
said
rep
rahm
emanuel
of
illinois
chairman
of
the
house
democratic
caucus
and
a
leading
advocate
of
democrats
trying
to
broaden
their
appeal
in
the
suburbs
the
partisan
spending
gap
was
stark
as
of
last
week
senate
democrats
had
spent
more
than
67
million
against
republican
candidates
compared
with
337
million
in
advertising
by
republicans
in
the
house
the
democratic
congressional
campaign
committee
had
spent
73
million
compared
with
just
over
20
million
for
the
national
republican
congressional
committee
according
to
campaign
finance
reports
most
of
the
house
republican
money
was
spent
on
behalf
of
incumbents
or
in
districts
where
a
republican
is
retiring
emphasizing
how
much
the
party
was
playing
defense
by
contrast
house
democrats
spent
most
of
their
money
in
the
last
month
going
after
republican
seats
in
colorado
nebraska
washington
west
virginia
and
elsewhere
on
sunday
democrats
prepared
one
last
radio
advertisement
to
begin
running
monday
in
an
effort
to
claim
the
seat
of
thomas
m
reynolds
a
republican
retiring
from
his
upstate
new
york
district
near
buffalo
that
kind
of
says
it
all
said
rep
thomas
m
davis
iii
a
retiring
virginia
republican
whose
own
suburban
seat
is
likely
to
go
democratic
on
tuesday
davis
said
republicans
simply
faced
too
many
disadvantages
heading
into
election
day
including
a
lopsided
number
of
retirements
in
the
house
and
senate
an
unpopular
president
and
an
economic
collapse
you
like
to
see
a
fair
fight
said
davis
a
former
chairman
of
the
republican
congressional
campaign
committee
but
basically
we
are
playing
basketball
in
our
street
shoes
and
long
pants
and
the
democrats
have
on
their
uniforms
and
chuck
taylors
neither
of
the
national
senate
campaign
arms
was
advertising
in
colorado
new
mexico
or
virginia
indicating
that
republicans
were
virtually
ceding
those
states
where
members
of
their
party
are
retiring
to
the
democrats
senate
democrats
were
also
optimistic
about
the
prospects
of
unseating
sen
john
e
sununu
in
new
hampshire
and
sen
ted
stevens
in
alaska
where
stevens
campaigned
despite
being
newly
convicted
on
felony
ethics
charges
democrats
said
they
saw
themselves
with
the
advantage
in
minnesota
north
carolina
and
oregon
giving
them
a
reasonable
chance
at
claiming
eight
seats
and
enlarging
their
senate
majority
to
59
if
they
hold
their
current
seats
if
democrats
swept
those
races
it
could
leave
the
potential
60th
vote
to
break
filibusters
resting
on
the
outcome
in
georgia
mississippi
or
kentucky
where
sen
mitch
mcconnell
the
republican
leader
is
in
a
competitive
race
with
bruce
lunsford
a
businessman
polls
show
democrats
trailing
but
within
striking
distance
in
all
three
races
with
the
final
results
potentially
hinging
on
the
presidential
race
and
turnout
among
democratically
inclined
black
voters
in
mississippi
which
has
not
sent
a
freshman
democrat
to
the
senate
since
john
c
stennis
was
elected
in
1947
sen
roger
wicker
a
republican
appointed
last
year
to
fill
the
seat
left
vacant
by
trent
lotts
resignation
is
in
a
tight
race
with
former
gov
ronnie
musgrove
a
democrat
we
feel
we
have
a
lot
of
momentum
said
sen
charles
e
schumer
of
new
york
chairman
of
the
democratic
senatorial
campaign
committee
but
we
are
ever
mindful
that
getting
to
60
is
an
extremely
difficult
thing
to
do
because
we
are
in
so
many
red
states
republicans
privately
acknowledged
that
there
was
little
hope
for
some
of
their
candidates
including
sen
elizabeth
dole
of
north
carolina
but
republicans
have
not
given
up
on
the
idea
of
unseating
sen
mary
l
landrieu
in
louisiana
a
state
where
sen
john
mccain
was
running
well
against
sen
barack
obama
in
the
presidential
race
a
victory
over
landrieu
by
john
kennedy
the
state
treasurer
would
be
a
significant
moral
victory
for
republicans
and
they
pointed
to
internal
polls
that
show
a
close
race
in
louisiana
north
carolina
and
oregon
republicans
were
trying
to
energize
voters
with
the
threat
of
democratic
dominance
in
washington
running
advertisements
that
warn
voters
about
complete
liberal
control
of
government
we
agree
with
chuck
schumer
that
this
is
a
tectonic
election
said
rebecca
fisher
spokeswoman
for
the
national
republican
senatorial
committee
and
if
democrats
get
their
way
this
country
will
shift
so
far
left
it
will
take
generations
to
get
back
on
track
both
parties
were
focusing
substantial
final
energies
on
the
senate
race
in
minnesota
where
sen
norm
coleman
the
republican
was
in
a
heated
clash
with
his
democratic
challenger
al
franken
a
former
comedian
and
radio
talk
show
host
the
race
remained
close
as
coleman
was
named
in
a
lastminute
lawsuit
in
texas
alleging
that
a
businessman
had
funneled
75000
to
him
through
his
wifes
business
coleman
who
has
filed
an
unfair
campaign
practices
complaint
accusing
franken
of
broadcasting
falsehoods
in
his
advertisements
denied
any
impropriety
but
the
lawsuit
led
to
a
flurry
of
news
accounts
only
days
before
the
election
in
kentucky
mcconnell
enlisted
hundreds
of
volunteers
to
knock
on
doors
and
to
make
phone
calls
in
the
remaining
hours
he
was
to
embark
on
a
flyaround
of
the
states
cities
monday
in
his
effort
to
repel
the
serious
challenge
from
lunsford
who
brought
in
one
of
kentuckys
favorite
daughters
the
actress
ashley
judd
to
campaign
on
his
behalf
in
the
closing
days
strategists
for
both
parties
said
it
seemed
increasingly
possible
that
the
full
senate
picture
might
not
even
be
settled
tuesday
given
that
a
thirdparty
candidate
could
cause
both
sen
saxby
chambliss
rga
and
his
democratic
opponent
jim
martin
to
fall
short
of
50
percent
of
the
vote
forcing
a
runoff
on
dec
2
party
operatives
also
warned
that
tuesday
was
likely
to
produce
some
surprises
considering
the
strong
resentment
toward
congress
that
has
been
reflected
in
polls
for
months
they
predicted
upsets
of
some
house
incumbents
not
thought
to
be
in
trouble
republicans
said
they
believed
some
top
targets
of
the
democrats
like
rep
dave
reichert
of
washington
and
christopher
shays
of
connecticut
would
be
able
to
hang
on
because
they
and
others
had
run
strong
campaigns
built
on
their
individual
images
and
records
republican
candidates
who
have
established
their
own
personal
brand
and
have
framed
their
respective
races
around
creating
a
clear
choice
will
succeed
on
election
day
despite
the
turbulent
political
environment
said
ken
spain
a
spokesman
for
the
national
republican
congressional
committee
one
problem
for
house
republicans
was
that
freshmen
lawmakers
who
gave
democrats
control
of
the
house
after
the
2006
elections
were
faring
much
better
than
party
leaders
had
expected
some
like
rep
kirsten
gillibrand
who
represents
the
hudson
valley
in
new
york
became
prime
republican
targets
virtually
from
the
moment
they
were
elected
but
are
favored
to
win
second
terms
after
raising
formidable
sums
of
money
and
cultivating
moderate
voting
records
that
insulated
them
from
attack
rep
john
yarmuth
of
kentucky
president
of
the
democrats
2006
freshman
class
said
only
two
of
its
members
were
in
serious
trouble
rep
nick
lampson
of
texas
who
represents
a
heavily
republican
district
south
of
houston
and
rep
tim
mahoney
of
florida
who
has
been
entangled
in
a
scandal
over
extramarital
affairs
yarmuth
credited
house
democratic
leaders
with
pursuing
an
agenda
that
gave
the
freshmen
substantial
achievements
to
promote
back
home
especially
a
generous
new
education
benefit
for
veterans
that
counterbalanced
the
democrats
opposition
to
the
war
in
iraq
i
think
that
was
a
trademark
of
this
last
congress
that
created
a
moderate
image
that
we
were
promilitary
protroops
yarmuth
said
military
and
civilian
deaths
in
iraq
for
october
hit
the
lowest
monthly
levels
since
may
2004
the
us
military
said
sunday
the
announcement
was
further
evidence
of
a
decline
in
violence
since
a
significant
troop
increase
last
year
but
the
tragedy
of
one
family
in
kirkuk
is
a
reminder
of
just
how
dangerous
life
in
iraq
continues
to
be
in
the
past
year

where
should

abdullah
asked
death
faces
us
everywhere
that
may
be
a
predicament
familiar
to
families
across
iraq
but
the
us
military
was
still
eager
to
publicize
the
decline
in
deaths
thanks
to
the
strategic
partnership
we
have
with
the
coalition

iraqi
security
forces
and

violence
continued

rage
in

of

party
said
that
20
of
their
fighters
had
been
killed
in
attacks
by

but
they
said
that
the
morale
of

others
still
at

include

who
the

says
were
trained
in
assassination
and
the

said
to
have

schooled
in

hijacker
intelligence
officials
say
as
the
bush
administration
enters
its
final
months
with
no
apparent
plan
to
close
guantanamo
an
extensive
review
of
the
governments
military
tribunal
files
suggests
that
dozens
of
the
approximately
255
prisoners
remaining
in
detention
are
said
by
military
and
intelligence
agencies
to
have
been
captured
with
important
terrorism
suspects
to
have
connections
to
top
qaida
leaders
or
to
have
other
serious
terrorism
credentials
sens
john
mccain
and
barack
obama
have
said
they
would
close
the
detention
camp
but
the
review
of
the
governments
public
files
underscores
the
challenges
of
fulfilling
that
promise
the
next
president
will
have
to
contend
with
sobering
intelligence
claims
against
many
of
the
remaining
detainees
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
new
president
to
come
in
and
say
i
dont
believe
what
the
cia
is
saying
about
these
guys
said
daniel
marcus
a
democrat
who
was
general
counsel
of
the
911
commission
and
held
senior
positions
in
the
carter
and
clinton
administrations
the
strength
of
the
evidence
is
difficult
to
assess
because
the
government
has
kept
much
of
it
secret
and
because
of
questions
about
whether
some
was
gathered
through
torture
when
the
administration
has
had
to
defend
its
allegations
in
court
government
lawyers
in
several
cases
have
retreated
from
the
most
serious
claims
as
a
result
critics
have
raised
doubts
about
the
danger
of
guantanamos
prisoners
beyond
a
handful
of
the
camps
most
notorious
detainees
but
as
a
new
administration
begins
to
sort
through
the
governments
dossiers
on
the
men
the
analysis
shows
officials
are
likely
to
face
tough
choices
in
deciding
how
many
of
guantanamos
detainees
should
be
sent
home
how
many
should
be
charged
and
what
to
do
with
the
rest
the
pentagon
has
declined
to
provide
a
list
of
the
detainees
or
even
to
specify
how
many
there
are
beyond
offering
a
figure
of
about
255
but
by
reviewing
thousands
of
pages
of
government
documents
released
in
recent
years
as
well
as
court
records
and
news
media
reports
from
around
the
world
the
new
york
times
was
able
to
compile
its
own
list
and
construct
a
picture
of
the
population
still
detained
at
guantanamo
much
of
the
analysis
is
based
on
records
of
hearings
at
guantanamo
about
individual
detainees
which
have
been
made
public
since
2006
as
a
result
of
a
lawsuit
by
the
associated
press
the
times
has
posted
those
documents
on
its
web
site
arranged
by
detainee
name
the
analysis
shows
that
about
34
of
the
remaining
detainees
were
seized
in
raids
in
pakistan
that
netted
three
men
the
government
calls
major
qaida
operatives
abu
zubaydah
ramzi

abdu

sixteen
detainees
are
accused
of
some
of
the
most
significant
terrorist
attacks
in
the
last
decade
including
the
1998
us
embassy
bombings
the
2000
attack
on
the
uss
cole
in
yemen
and
the
sept
11
attacks
twenty
others
were
called
bin
ladens
bodyguards
the
analysis
also
shows
that
13
of
the
original
23
detainees
who
arrived
at
guantanamo
on
jan
11
2002
remain
there
nearly
seven
years
later
of
the
approximately
255
men
now
being
held
more
than
60
have
been
cleared
for
release
or
transfer
according
to
the
pentagon
but
remain
at
guantanamo
because
of
difficulties
negotiating
transfer
agreements
between
the
united
states
and
other
countries
two
of
those
still
held
government
documents
show
were
seen
by
bin
laden
as
potential
sept
11
hijackers
the
case
of
mohammed
alqahtani
whom
the
government
has
labeled
a
potential
20th
hijacker
has
drawn
wide
notice
because
he
was
subjected
to
interrogation
tactics
that
included
sleep
deprivation
isolation
and
being
put
on
a
leash
and
forced
to
perform
dog
tricks
the
other
detainee
deemed
a
potential
hijacker
whose
presence
at
guantanamo
has
gone
virtually
unmentioned
in
public
reports
is
a
yemeni
called
abu
bara
the

commission
said
he
studied
flights
and
airport
security
and
participated
in
an
important

meeting
for

as

said
during
guantanamo
hearings
that
their
father
imprisoned
in

was
a
close

of

as
a

of

hassan

to
have
been
involved
in

on

and

hassan
bin
attashs
lawyer
david
h
remes
said
the
governments
claims
about
the
detainees
were
not
credible
he
and
other
detainees
lawyers
say
that
the
governments
accusations
have
been
everchanging
and
that
much
of
the
evidence
was
obtained
using
techniques
he
and
others
have
described
as
torture
you
look
at
all
of
this
stuff
and
it
looks
terribly
scary
remes
said
but
how
do
we
know
any
of
it
is
true
the
extensive
use
of
secret
evidence
and
information
derived
from
aggressive
interrogations
has
led
many
critics
in
the
united
states
and
around
the
world
to
conclude
that
many
detainees
were
wrongly
held
nearly
seven
years
after
guantanamo
opened
its
metal
gates
only
18
of
the
current
detainees
are
currently
facing
war
crimes
charges
while
both
presidential
candidates
said
they
would
close
the
detention
center
they
have
not
said
in
detail
how
they
would
handle
the
remaining
detainees
mccain
has
said
he
would
move
the
guantanamo
detainees
to
the
united
states
but
has
indicated
that
he
would
try
them
in
the
pentagons
commission
system
established
after
911
after
the
conviction
at
guantanamo
last
summer
of
a
former
driver
for
osama
bin
laden
mccain
said
the
verdict
demonstrated
that
military
commissions
can
effectively
bring
very
dangerous
terrorists
to
justice
obama
has
said
the
bush
administrations
system
of
trying
detainees
has
been
an
enormous
failure
and
that
the
existing
american
legal
system

either
trials
in
civilian
or
military
courts

was
strong
enough
to
handle
the
trials
of
terror
suspects
but
in
a
speech
on
the
senator
floor
in
2006
obama
suggested
that
the
allegations
against
many
of
the
detainees
needed
to
be
taken
seriously
now
the
majority
of
the
folks
in
guantanamo
i
suspect
are
there
for
a
reason
obama
said
there
are
a
lot
of
dangerous
people
some
of
the
remaining
prisoners
have
appeared
determined
to
show
how
dangerous
they
are
i
admit
to
you
it
is
my
honor
to
be
an
enemy
of
the
united
states

a
yemeni
detainee
abdul

said
ahmed
had
been
trained
at
a
terrorist

how
to
dress

and
to
resist

america

on
his
innocence
but
described
a
training
camp
outside
kabul
afghanistan
where
according
to
information
he
gave
interrogators
men
were
given
lessons
on
how
to
make
poisons
that

binalshibh
was
caught
with
a
group
of
six
yemenis
all
of
whom
are
still
held
after

gunbattle
the
records
of
those

include
allegations
that

and

according
to
the
militarys
allegations
the
records
include
many
of
the
murky
cases
that
typify
the
image
of
guantanamo
where
detainees
take
issue
with
their
own
supposed
confessions
and
sometimes
their
identities
and
those
doubts
too
are
to
be
part
of
a
new
administrations
inheritance
i
was
forced
to
say
all
these
things
an
algerian
detainee
adil
hadi
al
jazairi
bin
hamlili
said
at
his
hearing
when
confronted
with
his
confession
to
murder
and
knowledge
of
a
plot
to
sell
uranium
to
alqaida
i
was
abused
mentally
and
psychologically
by
threatening
to
be
raped
he
said
adding
you
would
say
anything
abdul
hafiz
an
afghan
accused
of
killing
a
red
cross
worker
at
a
taliban
roadblock
in
2003
told
a

officer
that
he

the

again
that

the
officer
reported
to
a
military
tribunal
the
government
of
zimbabwe
led
by
president
robert
mugabe
spent
73
million
donated
by
an
international
organization
to
fight
killer
diseases
on
other
things
and
has
failed
to
honor
requests
to
return
the
money
according
to
the
organizations
inspector
general
the
actions
by
zimbabwe
have
deprived
the
organization
the
global
fund
to
fight
aids
tuberculosis
and
malaria
of
resources
it
needs
and
damaged
efforts
to
expand
lifesaving
treatment
said
the
inspector
general
john
parsons
zimbabwes
actions
also
jeopardize
a
more
ambitious
188
million
global
fund
grant
to
zimbabwe
due
for
consideration
by
the
funds
board
on
friday
parsons
said
the
global
fund
has
continued
to
demand
that
zimbabwe
return
the
money
and
global
fund
officials
say
zimbabwean
financial
officials
have
promised
to
do
so
by
thursday
but
parsons
said
zimbabwean
officials
also
said
they
had
not
repaid
the
money
because
they
did
not
have
enough
foreign
currency
the
breakdown
of
trust
between
the
global
fund
and
the
government
of
zimbabwe
comes
at
a
moment
of
widening
humanitarian
crisis
and
casts
further
doubt
on
the
willingness
of
western
donors
to
invest
heavily
in
rebuilding
the
economically
broken
nation
as
long
as
mugabe
is
in
charge
even
if
a
deadlock
over
a
powersharing
government
is
resolved
parsons
said
in
an
interview
on
sunday
that
last
year
the
global
fund
deposited
123
million
in
foreign
currency
into
zimbabwes
reserve
bank
he
declined
to
speculate
on
how
the
73
million
it
was
seeking
to
be
returned
had
been
spent
except
to
say
it
was
not
on
the
intended
purpose
civic
groups
and
opposition
officials
maintain
that
the
reserve
bank
helps
finance
mugabes
patronage
machine
parsons
did
offer
an
example
of
the
human
consequences
of
the
reserve
banks
failure
to
hand
over
the
money
for
disease
fighting
the
global
fund
has
brought
in
large
quantities
of
medicines
that
can
cure
malaria
but
has
been
able
to
finance
the
training
of
only
495
people
to
distribute
them
safely
instead
of
the
planned
27000
there
were
27
million
cases
of
malaria
among
zimbabwes
12
million
people
in
the
world
health
organizations
most
recent
estimates
the
drugs
expire
by
the
middle
of
next
year
and
it
would
be
criminal
if
we
cant
use
them
because
of
these
problems
parsons
said
theyve
got
quite
a
short
shelf
life
her
crowds
are
smaller
now
and
most
of
the
reporters
are
gone
the
campaign
posters
say
his
name
not
hers
and
instead
of
championing
her
ideas
for
health
insurance
or
tax
relief
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
is
giving
out
1800
numbers
and
internet
addresses
for
sen
barack
obamas
campaign
watching
clinton
campaign
for
her
old
rival
masking
what
friends
say
is
lingering
disappointment
it
is
easy
to
recall
happier
days
the
bitterness
of
that
long
primary
battle
however
is
the
last
thing
that
obama
supporters
brought
up
about
clinton
in
florida
last
weekend
of
20
interviewed
all
effusively
praised
her
all
20
said
that
if
obama
won
they
hoped
that
she
would
be
his
secretary
of
state
or
that
she
would
shepherd
his
health
care
or
energy
bills
through
the
senate
all
20
said
they
hoped
she
would
run
for
president
again
for
the
friends
and
allies
already
thinking
about
clintons
political
future
the
possibility
of
a
victory
by
sen
john
mccain
on
tuesday
would
upend
an
array
of
assumptions
not
least
of
which
that
clinton

if
she
were
to
run
again

would
not
do
so
until
2016
when
she
would
be
turning
69
at
the
same
time
under
a
mccain
presidency
clinton
could
be
wellpositioned
given
her
friendship
with
him
and
good
standing
among
washington
republicans
to
help
him
with
a
democraticled
congress
on
alternative
energy
which
they
have
both
highlighted
on
the
campaign
trail
while
clintons
high
profile
in
democratic
politics
has
been
fortified
by
her
work
for
obama
her
friends
say
it
is
too
soon
to
say
what
the
future
holds
for
her
for
one
thing
they
say
she
is
not
over
her
primary
loss
some
days
it
is
hard
for
her
even
a
little
heartbreaking
to
campaign
for
obama
given
how
much
she
wanted
to
be
president
others
say
that
she
is
being
a
good
soldier
because
she
wants
to
be
a
power
player
in
washington
if
obama
wins
but
that
she
is
not
sure
what
her
role
might
be
millions
of
voters
will
encounter
an
unfamiliar
lowtech
landscape
at
the
polls
on
tuesday
about
half
of
all
voters
will
vote
in
a
way
that
is
different
from
what
they
did
in
the
last
presidential
election
and
most
will
use
paper
ballots
rather
than
the
touchscreen
machines
that
have
caused
concern
among
voting
experts
but
the
change
does
not
guarantee
a
smooth
election
day
as
the
nations
voting
system
remains
untested
for
what
is
expected
to
be
an
unprecedented
turnout
six
years
after
the
largest
federal
overhaul
in
how
elections
are
run
voting
experts
are
still
predicting
machine
and
ballot
shortages
in
several
swing
states
and
late
tallies
on
election
night
twothirds
of
voters
will
mark
their
choice
with
a
pencil
on
a
paper
ballot
that
is
counted
by
an
optical
scanning
machine
a
method
considered
far
more
reliable
and
verifiable
than
touch
screens
but
paper
ballots
bring
their
own
potential
problems
voting
experts
say
the
scanners
can
break
down
leading
to
delays
and
confusion
for
poll
workers
and
voters
and
the
paper
ballots
of
about
a
third
of
all
voters
will
be
counted
not
at
the
polling
place
but
later
at
a
central
county
location
that
means
that
if
a
voter
has
made
an
error

not
filling
in
an
oval
properly
for
example
a
mistake
often
made
by
the
kind
of
novice
voters
who
will
be
flocking
to
the
polls

it
will
not
be
caught
until
it
is
too
late
as
a
result
those
ballots
will
be
disqualified
voting
rights
groups
have
also
filed
lawsuits
against
election
officials
in
pennsylvania
and
virginia
saying
they
have
not
stocked
enough
paper
ballots
to
prepare
for
the
expected
turnout
most
voting
experts
are
not
predicting
a
repeat
of
the
florida
meltdown
of
2000
but
they
are
warning
that
shortages
of
electronic
voting
machines
or
printed
ballots
in
swing
states
along
with
problems
verifying
the
identity
of
voters
could
worsen
lines
and
fray
nerves
what
has
traditionally
happened
in
this
country
is
that
a
change
in
voting
equipment
happens
once
in
the

an
election
official

this
time
nearly
60
percent
of
the
country
will
vote
in
places
that
in
the
last
eight
years
have
changed
their
voting

about
a
fourth
of
voters
will
still
use
electronic

that
offer
no
paper

to
verify
that
their
choice
was
accurately
recorded
even
though
these

are
vulnerable
to

eight

at

registered

pushed

and
it
jumped
to
the

calvin

an

supporter
who
tried
to

early
in

wva
im
a
registered
republican
and
ive
voted
in
every
presidential

since
1948
i
dont
like
seeing
my

do
something
i
didnt
tell
it
to
do
i
take
that
real
serious
thomas
daughter
micki
clendenin
said
the
same
thing
had
happened
to
her
in
both
cases
poll
workers
at
the
site
had
them
touch
the
screen
a
few
more
times
and
the
voting
machine
changed
their
ballot
to
their
candidate
choice
state
and
local
officials
said
these
were
isolated
cases
and
that
poll
workers
had
fixed
the
problems
it
was
corrected
clendenin
said
but
it
still
made
me
wonder
it
was
not
supposed
to
be
this
way
after
the
debacle
of
2000
congress
passed
a
federal
law
the
help
america
vote
act
to
avoid
similar
mishaps
it
included
money
for
new
machines
to
modernize
the
voting
process
but
in
many
ways
things
have
become
even
messier
the
first
machines
bought
with
the
federal
money
were
largely
touchscreens
and
brought
new
problems
decreasing
public
confidence
in
the
process
and
doubling
the
number
of
electionrelated
lawsuits
since
2000
in
the
past
two
years
the
pendulum
has
swung
away
from
electronic
machines
but
the
change
has
come
during
one
of
the
most
dramatic
presidential
elections
in
modern
history
counties
and
states
are
better
prepared
for
machine
problems
than
they
have
been
in
the
past
said
lawrence
norden
a
voting
expert
with
the
brennan
center
for
justice
at
the
new
york
university
school
of
law
problem
is
that
this
election
may
not
be
like
any
other
in
terms
of
the
strain
on
the
system
and
small
problems
can
have
big
consequences
when
there
are
such
tight
margins
and
so
many
people
showing
up
to
vote
most
states
have
passed
laws
requiring
paper
records
of
every
vote
cast
which
experts
consider
an
important
safeguard
but
most
of
them
do
not
have
strong
audit
laws
to
ensure
that
machine
totals
are
vigilantly
checked
against
the
paper
records
last
year
a
study
by
the
brennan
center
found
that
at
least
17
of
the
38
states
with
paper
records
did
not
require
audits
after
every
election

a
66yearold
catholic
who
lives
in
a
denver
suburb
i
admit
it
rankles
me
so
much
because
im
on
the
other
side
of
the
political
spectrum
but
i
vehemently
object
to
the
notion
that
im
not
a
good
catholic
because
i
see
things
differently

chaput
has

critical
of

recently
the

told
a

group
oct

that
the
cornerstone
of
catholic

teaching
is
protecting
human

the

committed

of

roe

supreme
court
decision
legalizing
abortion
the
democratic
platform
that
emerged
from
denver
in
august
2008
is
clearly
antilife
chaput
said
many
catholics
feel
the
pressure
is
inappropriate
i
think
the
archbishop
in
denver
and
bishop
in
colorado
springs
have
taken
positions
that
are
bordering
if
not
crossing
the
line
drawn
by
us
bishops
against
supporting
or
opposing
a
candidate
or
party
haugh
said
denver
archdiocese
officials
deny
partisanship
the
church
isnt
telling
people
who
to
vote
for
archdiocese
spokeswoman
jeanette
demelo
said
the
church
has
been
voicing
moral
teaching
and
encouraging
catholics
to
pray
and
reflect
on
church
teaching
so
that
they
are
making
decisions
in
good
conscience
yet
chaput
and
auxiliary
bishop
james
conley
have
left
little
wiggle
room
for
catholics
to
pick
candidates
like
obama
who
support
legal
abortion
conley
according
to
the
denver
catholic
register
told
parishioners
that
given
a
choice
between
a
prochoice
candidate
and
a
prolife
candidate
he
couldnt
see
how
a
catholic
could
justify
voting
for
a
supporter
of

an
intrinsic
evil

university
theologian

richard
mcbrien
said
bishops
who
make
a
case
for

politics
or
openly
oppose
a
political
candidate
are
in
violation
of
us
conference
of
catholic
bishops
guidelines
set
in
1984
and
most
recently
reaffirmed
in
2007
catholic
voters
and
their
bishops
should
examine
the
positions
of
the
candidates
on
the
full
range
of
issues
as
well
as
their
integrity
philosophy
and
performance
mcbrien

42yearold
denver

catholics
cant
be

the

like
to
say
abortion
trumps
every
other

it
cant
all
the
issues
are
too
interconnected
merida
said
having
grown
up
in
an
urban
latino
environment
she
knows
why
many
people
have
abortions
they
feel
unsupported
they
cant

said
his
parish
priest
has
openly
criticized
obama
during
mass
i
couldnt
believe
my
ears
i
feel
like
the
republicans
have
somehow
hijacked
the
church
brezina
said
he
voted
twice
for
george
bush
because
he
opposed
abortion
and
bush
didnt
end
abortions
maybe
abortion

isnt
what
needed
maybe
we
need

hearts

when
will
you

a
cell
phone
was
pressed
to
sen
barack
obamas
ear
as
he
slouched
down
in
a
black
leather
chair
in
the
front
cabin
of
his
campaign
airplane
he
leaned
away
from
the
headrest
where
his
name
is
spelled
out
in
blue
stitching
a
few
miles
away
thousands
of
people
streamed
into
jfk
stadium
at
parkview
high
school
for
a
latenight
rally
on
saturday
but
obama
stayed
on
his
chartered
boeing
757
as
he
spoke
by
conference
call
to
thousands
of
his
team
leaders
around
the
country
the
volunteers
who
form
the
ranks
of
an
army
that
he
hopes
will
give
him
an
edge
in
the
waning
hours
of
the
presidential
race
as
he
pressed
his
right
hand
to
his
forehead
his
sober
expression
seemed
at
odds
with
the
confident
gleam
in
the
eyes
of
his
advisers
while
obama
smiles
less
than
he
once
did
gauging
his
mood
simply
by
looking
at
him
is
risky
for
a
man
whose
flatline
temperament
has
seldom
spiked
along
the
rocky
points
of
his
journey
in
a
campaign
where
he
has
slogged
through
more
competitive
election
days
than
any
recent
nominee
only
one
more
lies
ahead
and
it
is
the
long
path
of
the
democratic
primary
which
lurched
from
the
ups
of
iowa
to
the
downs
of
ohio
that
his
friends
say
provided
obama
with
a
steady
equilibrium
as
he
enters
this
final
turn
in
the
race
for
the
white
house
as
painful
as
the
primary
season
was
and
how
agitating
it
could
be
it
turned
out
to
be
a
blessing
for
him
said
eric
whitaker
a
longtime
friend
from
chicago
who
joined
obama
aboard
the
crowded
campaign
plane
for
the
last
three
days
but
my
role
now
is
to
keep
him
loose
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
his
world
the
lines
in
obamas
face
have
grown
a
bit
deeper
since
he
started
his
campaign
with
the
notches
of
gray
hair
along
his
temples
far
more
pronounced
he
often
carries
the
look
of
exhaustion
but
flying
the
other
night
to
nevada
where
he
arrived
after
midnight
obama
passed
on
the
chance
to
take
much
of
a
nap
instead
he
walked
around
the
cabin
of
his
airplane
which
is
about
the
size
of
a
bedroom
and
talked
about
a
favorite
diversion

the
coming
basketball
season

as
he
took
care
not
to
step
on
a
senior
foreign
policy
adviser
mark
lippert
who
was
asleep
on
the
floor
in
the
last
days
on
the
trail
he
is
finishing
ghost
wars
the
secret
history
of
the
cia
afghanistan
and
bin
laden
and
taking
an
occasional
glance
at
us
weekly
he
reads
at
least
two
newspapers
a
day
vigilantly
checks
his
blackberry
for
updates
on
earlyvoting
tallies
and
browses
briefing
books
in
a
marathon
when
you
are
on
mile
20
you
start
getting
tired
but
when
you
are
on
mile
25
you
dont
said
lippert
who
has
grown
familiar
with
obamas
travel
rhythms
while
accompanying
him
on
the
four
foreign
trips
he
has
taken
since
becoming
a
senator
thats
where
hes
at
whatever
emotion
he
feels
as
his
candidacy
draws
to
a
close
he
displays
little
of
it
either
in
public
appearances
or
private
conversations
with
his
close
advisers
the
air
of
confidence
that
he
exudes
which
some
critics
castigate
as
arrogance
grew
in
part
out
of
the
primary
when
he
worked
to
avoid
perceptions
that
he
was
weak
or
not
ready
but
now
he
is
described
by
friends
as
feeling
as
though
he
has
been
thoroughly
tested
and
is
prepared
to
take
on
the
job
he
has
spent
22
months
fighting
for
still
it
is
hard
for
even
those
closest
to
obama
to
fathom
what
these
days
are
precisely
like
even
for
the
imperturbable

often
inscrutable

senator
from
illinois
his
world
is
awash
in
powerful
conflicting
emotions
the
realization
presumably
that
he
may
be
about
to
become
president
the
huge
optimism
that
he
has
unleashed
evident
in
the
crowds
he
is
drawing
and
something
he
has
told
aides
worries
him
a
bit
given
the
expectations
set
for
him
the
weighty
thinking
he
is
gradually
giving
to
how
he
would
staff
a
government
and
deal
with
a
transition
in
such
a
difficult
time
all
of
this
is
taking
place
at
a
time
where
the
woman
who
played
a
large
role
in
raising
him
his
grandmother
is
approaching
death
what
if
i
disappoint
people
valerie
jarrett
a
close
friend
and
adviser
recalled
obama
asking
at
several
points
throughout
the
campaign
thats
what
gives
him
the
energy
to
keep
getting
up
every
day
it
has
been
months
since
obama
has
ventured
with
any
regularity
to
the
back
of
his
plane
where
the
journalists
sit
the
one
time
he
played
the
board
game
taboo
on
a
crosscountry
flight
to
oregon
is
a
distant
memory
he
has
not
taken
questions
for
so
long
that
reporters
have
taken
to
shouting
at
him
as
he
boards
his
plane
as
he
climbed
up
the
steps
of
his
airplane
here
on
sunday
morning
headed
for
ohio
a
reporter
shouted
to
question
why
he
hadnt
held
a
news
conference
in
weeks
i
will
obama
said
on
wednesday
on
a
final
weekend
pass
through
electoral
battlegrounds
that
spanned
three
time
zones
the
electoral
climate
and
his
campaign
organization
provide
him
the
luxury
of
focusing
on
states
that
favored
the
republican
ticket
four
years
ago
but
when
his
democratic
crowds
jeer
at
the
mere
mention
of
sen
john
mccain
he
offers
a
gentle
scolding
you
dont
need
to
boo
you
just
need
to
vote
it
is
a
true
crowdpleaser
and
he
reprises
it
in
city
after
city
his
crowds
have
rarely
been
larger
or
more
enthusiastic

often
perhaps
more
outwardly
so
than
the
candidate
himself
these
days
obama
is
racing
through
his
speeches
whittling
down
a
message
that
once
stretched
for
more
than
an
hour
to
a
disciplined
30
minutes
he
works
the
rope
line
at
every
stop
but
taking
a
closer
look
you
realize
that
its
as
much
for
a
few
photographs
as
for
a
lot
of
handshakes
at
each
event
though
he
stays
long
enough
to
sign
a
stack
of
books
for
supporters
during
a
rally
outside
orlando
fla
the
other
night
where
he
was
joined
for
the
first
time
on
stage
by
former
president
bill
clinton
he
was
visibly
chilly
in
the
unusually
cool
air
with
a
temperature
that
dipped
into
the
40s
he
had
hoped
to
wear
a
coat
but
clinton
did
not
so
obama
came
to
the
stage
without
one
not
so
the
next
night
in
virginia
where
a
cool
and
damp
chill
also
hung
in
the
air
i
did
decide
to
wear
a
coat
because
you
want
a
president
who
has
sense
obama
told
the
crowd
from
behind
the
podium
where
he
was
covered
in
a
black
wool
overcoat
while
he
may
not
be
coasting
to
the
finish
line
hes
not
running
as
hard
as
he
did
during
his
battle
with
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
for
the
democratic
nomination
on
sunday
he
was
in
the
gym
of
the
doubletree
hotel
here
shortly
after
6
am
but
he
spent
some
time
with
his
wife
and
daughters
before
boarding
his
plane
at
930
am
he
didnt
arrive
for
his
first
public
event
of
the
day
at
the
ohio
statehouse
in
columbus
until
1
pm
his
campaign
schedule
like
obama
himself
can
be
slow
to
start
in
the
morning
but
runs
late
into
the
night
after
appearing
with
bruce
springsteen
at
a
rally
in
cleveland
followed
by
a
stop
in
cincinnati
obama
was
not
scheduled
to
arrive
at
his
hotel
in
jacksonville
fla
until
after
1
am
on
monday
if
there
is
a
whiff
of
nostalgia
surrounding
the
obama
campaign
in
these
final
hours
before
the
election
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
emanating
from
the
candidate
himself
he
is
eager
to
be
finished
campaigning
several
of
his
friends
said
and
for
months
has
been
immersing
himself
in
the
work
of
the
presidency
well
before
he
knows
if
it
will
ever
be
his
he
spends
far
less
time
on
the
telephone
these
days
making
political
calls
to
local
democratic
chairmen
his
call
list
now
includes
officials
in
washington
including
treasury
secretary
henry
m
paulson
to
whom
he
spoke
to
several
times
a
day
for
weeks
about
the
government
rescue
plan
and
he
is
in
frequent
conversations
with
congressional
leaders
over
how
to
proceed
should
he
win
on
tuesday
on
saturday
morning
obama
met
in
his
hotel
suite
at
caesars
palace
in
las
vegas
with
sen
harry
reid
of
nevada
the
majority
leader
they
spent
about
45
minutes
together
with
reid
ticking
through
a
list
of
items
sketched
on
a
note
card
in
his
breast
pocket
obama
also
spoke
about
how
his
life
has
changed
a
point
that
was
driven
home
on
friday
night
when
he
went
home
to
see
his
daughters
for
halloween
and
grew
agitated
when
he
felt
that
a
group
of
reporters
and
photographers
had
crowded
him
he
said
he
likes
to
go
out
trickortreating
but
he
cant
anymore
reid
said
in
an
interview
recalling
the
conversation
he
had
with
obama
he
said
he
guessed
he
could
have
worn
a
barack
obama
mask
one
of
the
greatest
frustrations
of
his
candidacy

being
away
from
his
wife
michelle
and
his
two
daughters
malia
and
sasha

will
come
to
an
end
win
or
lose
when
his
plane
touched
down
on
saturday
afternoon
in
pueblo
colo
his
step
carried
an
extra
lilt
it
was
not
because
of
the
place
that
he
finds
himself
in
the
closing
moments
of
his
campaign
but
because
his
two
daughters
were
standing
on
the
breezy
tarmac
waiting
to
be
scooped
up
by
their
daddy
dana
point

dont
be

upon

best
players
but
will
be
a
marquee
free
agent
at
seasons
end
that
represents
a
double
whammy

price
to
keep
him
plus
price
to
acquire
him
the
yankees
have
pieces
such
as
starter
phil

and
second

robinson
cano
that
could
work
but
gm
brian
cashman
refused
to
part
with
young
players
for
johan
santana
last
winter
as
he
tries
to
prevent
the
yankees
from
relying
so
heavily
on
free
agency
boston
can
dangle
pitcher
clay
buchholz
but
it
would
take
a
lot
more
and
the
angels
have
starters
joe
saunders
and
ervin
santana
both
of
whom
the
rockies
like
but
la
hasnt
dealt
a
young
pitcher
in
seven
years
atkins
is
more
marketable
in
some
ways
because
he
has
two
years
before
free
agency
and
will
make
roughly
65
million
this
season
compared
to
hollidays
135
million
the
angels
interest
in
atkins
and
holliday
will
be
tied
to
their
success
in
resigning
mark
teixeira
if
he
returns
their
need
for
either
rockie
shrinks
the
american
league
central
should
be
the
epicenter
for
interest
in
atkins
with
the
twins
and
indians
trying
to
fill
needs
at
third
base
and
each
possessing
a
bushel
of
young
pitchers
its
not
too
hard
to
see
conversations
starting
around
the

kevin
slowey
and
nick

clevelands
aaron

and
jeremy

taveras
already
has
gotten
some
nibbles
from
the
white
sox
nationals
and
yankees
who
have
pitcher
ian
kennedy
as
a
chip
because
of
the
uncertain
economy

frozen
or
reduced
ticket
prices
around
the
league
are
a
solid
indicator

gms
are
bracing
for
an
anxious
future
the
big
deals

whether
for
holliday
atkins
or
san
diegos
jake
peavy

might
have
to
wait
until
the
winter
meetings
next
month
until
then
theres
nothing
wrong
with
laying
groundwork
with
castles
in
the
sand
the
economy
will
be
a
factor
arizonas
josh
byrnes
said
thats
why
i
dont
have
a
real
sense
if
there
will
be

captured
early
in

war

and
many
of
them
are
still
being
held
at
guantanamo
bay
cuba
others
still
at
the
muchcriticized

include
prisoners
who
the
government
says
were
trained
in
assassination
and
the
use
of

and

said
to
have

hijacker
intelligence
officials
say
as
the
bush
administration
enters
its
final
months
with
no
apparent
plan
to
close
guantanamo
an
extensive
review
of
the
governments
military
tribunal
files
suggests
that
dozens
of
the
approximately
255
prisoners
remaining
in
detention
are
said
by
military
and
intelligence
agencies
to
have
been
captured
with
important
terrorism
suspects
to
have
connections
to
top
qaida
leaders
or
to
have
other
serious
terrorism
credentials
sens
john
mccain
and
barack
obama
have
said
they
would
close
the
detention
camp
the
next
president
will
have
to
contend
with
sobering
intelligence
claims
against
many
of
the
remaining
detainees
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
new
president
to
come
in
and
say
i
dont
believe
what
the
cia
is
saying
about
these
guys
said
daniel
marcus
a
democrat
who
was
general
counsel
of
the
911
commission
and
held
senior
positions
in
the
carter
and
clinton
administrations
the
strength
of
the
evidence
is
difficult
to
assess
because
the
government
has
kept
much
of
it
secret
and
because
of
questions
about
whether
some
was
gathered
through
torture
but
as
a
new
administration
begins
to
sort
through
the
governments
dossiers
on
the
men
officials
are
likely
to
face
tough
choices
in
deciding
how
many
of
guantanamos
detainees
should
be
sent
home
how
many
should
be
charged
and
what
to
do
with
the
rest
it
was
bad
enough
for
rodrigo
sanchez
when
the
tree
trimming
jobs
began
heading
for
the
chipper
six
months
ago
but
as
work
gradually
diminished
so
did
a
pantry
meant
to
feed
him
his
wife
and
three
young
children
its
tough
to
make
ends
meet

theres
no

last

two
days
this
week
one
day

right
now
theres
nothing
we
can
do
as
the
economic
downturn
forces
more
workers
like
sanchez
to
seek
food
aid
demand
at

pantries
across
los

has
soared
but
a
month
before
thanksgiving
supplies
run
shorter
than

donations
to

have
slowed
officials
say
and
as
more
people
seek
help

many
for
the
first
time

the
grub
goes
out
faster
than
the

flows
in

had

in

the

for
food
is
especially
acute

for
givers
and

at

has
doubled
since
last
fall
from
600
new
clients
in
september
2007
to

the

the

running
out

when
faced
with
the
need
for
food
this
month
she
discovered
she
received
too
much
for
food
stamps
but
not
enough
for
the
supermarket
cashier
and
that
left
her
and
a
9yearold
without
enough
to
eat
when
she
first
resorted
to
the

bank
this
month
she
verged
on

she
called

daniella
of

said
its
really
great
to
come
to
a
place
like
this
to
get
food
many
pantries
say
supermarkets
and
private
donors
are
giving
less
food
and
money
because
of
the
poor
economy
the
good
news
is
that
the
us
department
of
agriculture
has
boosted
its
food
commodities
program
from
140
million
to
250
million
which
is

trickle

somewhere
in
a
corner
of
northeastern
ohio
just
five
days
before
the
presidential
election
that
more
than
a
few
pundits
have
declared
he
will
lose
sen
john
mccain
sat
in
the
back
of
his
campaign
bus
telling
his
favorite
henny
youngman
jokes
no
one
laughed
harder
than
he
did
it
was
one
after
another

take
my
wife
please
said
sen
lindsey
graham
a
south
carolina
republican
and
one
of
mccains
closest
friends
for
90
minutes
as
his
bus
rumbled
from
the
edge
of
lake
erie
to
youngstown
mccain
kept
up
the
patter
with
graham
and
his
campaigns
high
command
he
talked
about
how
he
once
saw
the
old
borscht
belt
comedian
perform
in
new
jersey
he
told
stories
about
morris
k
udall
the
legendary
arizona
congressman
and
he
roared
with
graham
about
a
book
he
was
reading
a
walk
in
the
woods
a
comic
account
of
an
outofshape
writers
2100mile
hike
of
the
appalachian
trail
no
one
is
suggesting
that
mccain
is
ecstatic
that
he
is
behind
in
the
polls
or
that
the
cognoscenti
as
he
puts
it
have
written
us
off
but
in
the
frantic
last
days
of
his
nearly
twoyear
second
quest
for
the
presidency
mccain
has
liberated
himself
from
the
irritable
edgy
candidate
of
a
month
ago
he
has
by
all
appearances
decided
he
will
get
to
tuesday
by
having
a
good
time
his
aides
say
he
is
relieved
that
the
race
is
almost
over
and
for
the
most
part
out
of
his
hands
he
is
also
buoyed

and
obsessed
his
staff
says

with
polls
that
show
the
race
tightening
in
some
battleground
states
and
allow
him
hope
that
he
might
still
have
a
shot
he
is
also
now
in
the
role
that
he
finds
at
least
familiar
if
not
comfortable

the
scrappy
underdog
barking
at
washington
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
his
first
stop
thursday
was
in
defiance
ohio
if
we
were
10
points
up
wed
all
be
a
little
bit
happier
said
mark
salter
one
of
mccains
closest
aides
but
you
throw
a
lot
of
stuff
at
the
guy
and
he
fights
all
the
harder
graham
and
mccains
other
traveling
buddy
sen
joseph
i
lieberman
independent
of
connecticut
are
a
frequent
part
of
the
road
show
and
will
fly
home
with
him
to
arizona
in
the
small
hours
of
tuesday
morning
aides
say
they
are
essential
to
improving
the
candidates
mood
graham
in
particular
mccains

cindy
who
is
constantly
at
his

at

my

hes
like

prozac
nicolle
wallace
a
top
adviser
to
mccain
said
of
graham
they
just
sit
there
and
laugh
mccain
has
also
been
moved
these
last
few
days
his
aides
say
by
the
panorama
of
america
that
has
unfolded
before
him
he
has
made
appearances
at
high
school
football
fields
town
squares
and
lumberyards
and
he
held
a
nostalgic
final
town
hall
meeting
sunday
night
here
in
peterborough
nh
one
of
the
earliest
stops
of
his
first
presidential
campaign
in
2000
on
friday
mccain
marveled
to
aides
about
the
beauty
of
the
rolling
appalachian
foothills
on
ohios
border
with
west
virginia
on
saturday
his
motorcade
sped
through
a
tunnel
of
gold
leaves
in
bucks
county
pa
two
hours
later
the
caravan
was
navigating
midtown
manhattan
so
mccain
could
open
saturday
night
live
with
tina
fey
there
he
goodnaturedly
mocked
his
circumstances
in
a
faux
qvc
segment
by
saying
he
could
only
afford
the
shopping
channel
and
not
a
halfhour
of
primetime
television
for
an
infomercial
like
the
one
by
sen
barack
obama
look
would
i
rather
be
on
three
major
networks
mccain
said
of
course
but
im
a
true
maverick

a
republican
without
money
whatever
happens
on
tuesday
mccains
aides
say
he
is
too
much
a
student
of
history
not
to
be
astonished
and
humbled
by
his
own
place
in
it
as
a
prisoner
of
war
in
vietnam
mccain
mused
to
his
cellmates
about
becoming
president
one
day
now
he
is
amazed
that
a
candidate
who
was
left
for
politically
dead
a
year
ago
has
managed
to
lurch

his
own
choice
of
verb
from
a
recent
interview

toward
the
finish
line
at
all
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
is
about
to
ease
up
on
his
decadelong
pursuit
of
the
white
house
he
wants
this
very
badly
graham
said
mccains
days
begin
earlier
than
they
used
to
around
6
am
for
morning
television
and
radio
interviews
that
he
races
through
in
5
and
10minute
bites
afterward
the
drill
is
the
same
as
it
has
been
from
the
start
he
and
his
aides
assemble
with
coffee
in
his
hotel
suite
go
over
the
plan
for
the
day
check
out
the
newspapers
and
lately
pore
over
the
campaigns
overnight
polls
mccain
tracks
every
hiccup
particularly
anything
from
his
own
pollster
bill
mcinturff
that
shows
him
edging
toward
obama
he
avidly
listens
to
campaign
aides
who
say
that
if
the
unexcitable
mcinturff
says
he
is
gaining
it
must
be
so
we
do
not
have
a
happynumbers
pollster
salter
said
weve
got
buzz
killer
by
the
middle
of
the
day
mccain
likes
to
have
news
of
the
latest
tracking
polls
we
all
kind
of
know
when
rasmussen
comes
out
and
zogby
wallace
said
so
we
all
watch
for
it
mccain
in
the
meantime
is
on
the
phone
a
halfdozen
times
each
with
his
campaign
manager
rick
davis
and
his
top
strategist
steve
schmidt
wanting
to
know
everything
they
are
doing
and
anything
they
have
heard
he
is
an
information
sponge
salter
said
his
low
point
his
aides
say
was
the
suspension
of
his
campaign
in
late
september
to
make
his
way
to
washington
to
help
negotiate
a
700
billion
bailout
of
wall
street
only
to
have
the
house
republicans
blow
the
deal
up
in
his
face
his
slight
edge
in
the
polls
evaporated
and
he
was
described
by
friends
as
angry
at
himself

when
rep
john
lewis
a
georgia
democrat
and
civil

leader
invoked
the
segregationist
george
wallace
to
rebuke
mccain
for
tolerating
insults
and
threats
hurled
at
obama
at
his
rallies
mccain
took
the
edge
off
some
of
his
rhetoric
and
has
in
the
last
few
days
loosened
up
in
his
speeches
although
he
still
lustily
attacks
obama
as
the
taxandspend
redistributionist
in
chief
who
can
not
be
trusted
to
lead
the
nation
in

but

mccain
shouted
on
a
chilly
saturday
morning
at

news
va
the
line
was
a
wellworn
one
from
his
stump
speech
about
what
he
calls
obamas
white
house
presumptions
but
he
delivered
it
laughing
out
loud
as
if
he
was
amusing
no
one
more
than
himself
during
the
day
he
gets
almost
no
exercise
eats
the
candy
and
junk
food
strewn
all
over
his
bus
and

slumped
in
his

in

once
called

banished
in

aides
say
he
is
convinced
that
they
are
all
rooting
for
obama
mccain
takes
an
ambien
if
he
needs
one
but
in
these
last
days
there
is
scant
sleep
on
the
schedule
he
planned
to
end
sunday
with
a
threehour
flight
from
new
hampshire
to
a
postmidnight
rally
in
miami
then
rest
briefly
and
head
to
the
airport
for
an
8
am
departure
for
tampa
from
there
he
was
to
embark
on
a
sevenstate
18hour
odyssey
across
america
north
to
tennessee
northeast
once
more
to
pennsylvania
then
west
with
the
setting
sun
to
indiana
new
mexico
nevada
and
finally
home
to
arizona
where
he
will
hold
a
midnight
rally
on
the
courthouse
steps
of
the
old
territorial
capital
of
prescott
the
town
where
he
has
ended
all
his
senate
campaigns
he
was
set
to
arrive
at
his
condominium
in
phoenix
sometime
after
2
am
on
election
day
there
would
in
any
case
be
little
time
for
the
rolling
seminars
he
once
conducted
in
the
back
of
his
bus
he
has
local
reporters
aboard
for
short
hops
but
he
and
cindy
mccain
spend
far
more
time
entertaining
a
shifting
cast
of
republican
governors
and
members
of
congress
last
week
on
the
campaign
plane
the
group
included
gov
charlie
crist
and
sen
mel
martinez
both
of
florida
martinez
came
through
the
curtain
long
enough
to
spin
about
what
might
have
been
that
if
lehman
brothers
and
the
insurance
giant
aig
had
not
foundered
we
would
still
be
up
seven
in
the
evenings
graham
and
mccains
top
campaign
advisers

almost
all
are
now
traveling
with
him

walk
the
candidate
to
his
hotel
room
where
they
go
over
the
plan
for
the
next
day
and
then
leave
him
alone
mccain
turns
on
espn
and
relaxes
after
rallies
that
blast
out
a
deafening
life
is
a
highway
and
other
campaign
anthems
its
like
being
in
a
rock
band
graham
said
you
do
your
gig
and
youve
got
to
wind
down
a
little
bit
before
mondays
marathon
mccain
said
goodbye
to
new
hampshire
the
state
that
gave
him
two
primary
victories
and
twice
resurrected
his
candidacy
polls
show
obama
with
a
doubledigit
lead
for
the
states
four
electoral
votes
and
it
was
an
odd
place
to
devote
five
precious
hours
just
a
day
and
a
half
before
the
election
but
mccain
loves
the
state
in
peterboroughs
90yearold
town
hall
he
jettisoned
his
stump
speech
to
answer
questions
on
politically
dangerous
topics
like
immigration
reform
that
he
has
avoided
for
months
he
even
had
praise
for
obama
i
admire
and
respect
my
opponent
he
said
it
was
a
message
tailored
to
his
audience
of
independentminded
voters
but
it
was
also
a
display
of
the
old
john
mccain
or
perhaps
of
the
new
one
of
these
last
few
days
i
come
to
the
people
of
new
hampshire

republicans
independents
democrats
libertarians
vegetarians
mccain
said
quietly
to
laughter
and
ask
again
to
let
me
go
on
one
more
mission
outspent
and
under
siege
in
a
hostile
political
climate
congressional
republicans
scrambled
this
weekend
to
save
embattled
incumbents
in
an
effort
to
hold
down
expected
democratic
gains
in
the
house
and
senate
on
tuesday
senate
republicans
threw
their
remaining
resources
into
protecting
endangered
lawmakers
in
georgia
minnesota
mississippi
new
hampshire
north
carolina
and
oregon
while
house
republicans
were
forced
to
put
money
into
what
should
be
secure
republican
territory
in
idaho
indiana
kentucky
virginia
and
wyoming
senate
democrats
were
active
in
nine
states
where
republicans
are
running
for
reelection
house
democrats
meanwhile
bought
advertising
in
63
districts
twice
the
number
of
districts
where
republicans
bought
advertisements
and
helped
candidates
we
are
deep
in
the
red
areas
rep
chris
van
hollen
of
maryland
chairman
of
the
democratic
congressional
campaign
committee
said
on
sunday
we
are
competing
now
in
districts
george
bush
carried
by
large
margins
in
2004
what
seems
especially
striking
about
this
years
congressional
races
is
that
democrats
appear
to
have
solidified
their
gains
from
the
2006
midterm
elections
and
are
pushing
beyond
their
traditional
urban
turf
into
what
once
were
safe
republican
strongholds
creating
a
struggle
for
the
suburbs
with
many
of
the
most
contested
house
races
occurring
in
republicanheld
districts
that
extend
beyond
cities
in
states
like
florida
michigan
minnesota
and
ohio
democrats
said
expected
victories
would
give
them
dominance
in
the
suburbs

the
traditional
foundation
of
republican
power
in
the
house
the
same
is
true
for
senate
democratic
candidates
who
are
seeking
to
nail
down
swing
counties
outside
urban
centers
and
move
the
party
toward
a
60vote
majority
that
could
overcome
a
filibuster
the
partisan
spending
gap
was
stark
as
of
last
week
senate
democrats
had
spent
more
than
67
million
against
republican
candidates
compared
with
337
million
in
advertising
by
republicans
in
the
house
the
democratic
congressional
campaign
committee
had
spent
73
million
compared
with
just
over
20
million
for
the
national
republican
congressional
committee
most
of
the
house
republican
money
was
spent
on
behalf
of
incumbents
or
in
districts
where
a
republican
is
retiring
emphasizing
how
much
the
party
was
playing
defense
by
contrast
house
democrats
spent
most
of
their
money
in
the
last
month
going
after
republican
seats
in
colorado

washington
west
virginia
and
elsewhere
gov
jim
gibbons
of
nevada
has
been
cleared
by
the
justice
department
of
any
wrongdoing
in
connection
with
an
inquiry
into
whether
he
helped
a
friend
win
defense
contracts
in
exchange
for
gifts
gibbons
lawyer
said
the
lawyer
abbe
d
lowell
said
the
lead
prosecutor
in
the
case
informed
gibbons
on
friday
that
no
charges
would
be
filed
and
that
the
investigation
related
to
gibbons
work
as
a
congressman
before
he
was
elected
governor
in
2006
had
been
closed
a
justice
department
spokeswoman
laura
sweeney
said
the
department
would
not
comment
lowell
said
gibbons
a
republican
whose
first
term
as
governor
has
been
dogged
by
legal
political
and
personal
troubles
would
make
a
statement
on
monday
the
investigation
spanned
18
months
lowell
said
and
began
when
a
former
staff
member
of
a
technology
company
run
by
a
friend
of
the
governor
made
accusations
of
influence
peddling
the
former
staff
member
dennis
montgomery
told
news
media
outlets
that
his
boss
warren
trepp
the
owner
of
etreppid
technologies
had
given
gibbons
money
casino
chips
and
a
caribbean
cruise
to
help
etreppid
win
defense
department
contracts
lowell
called
the
accusations
ridiculous
and
hogwash
and
said
the
governor
does
not
even
gamble
neither
the
governor
nor
i
lowell
added
have
any
problem
with
the
justice
department
having
to
investigate
allegations
even
if
they
are
crazy
because
he
is
a
highranking
public
official
and
he
knows
the
world
he
lives
in
they
handled
it
in
a
way
and
a
speed
that
was
up
to
them
though
we
wish
it
were
sooner
they
came
to
the
right
conclusion
lowell
said
gibbons
had
cooperated
in
the
investigation
and
in
recent
months
had
been
interviewed
by
fbi
agents
the
investigation
lowell
said
might
have
been
slowed
by
a
civil
lawsuit
between
montgomery
and
etreppid
which
was
settled
last
month
blxware
llc
the
company
where
montgomery
works
said
the
terms
of
the
settlement
were
confidential
but
the
company
based
in
bellevue
wash
disclosed
that
the
agreement
included
a
payment
to
trepp
as
compensation
for
certain
allegations
made
against
him
in
the
news
media
the
closing
of
the
investigation
provides
welcome
news
to
gibbons
in
a
trying
period
a
former
cocktail
waitress
filed
a
lawsuit
against
him
last
month
alleging
that
he
pushed
her
and
threatened
to
rape
her
after
a
night
of
drinking
in
las
vegas
just
before
the
november
2006
election
gibbons
denied
the
accusation
and
criminal
charges
were
not
filed
gibbons
63
and
his
wife
dawn
54
began
divorce
proceedings
this
year
after
22
years
of
marriage
the
news
media
in
nevada
have
made
much
of
her
accusation
of
adultery
and
the
disclosure
of
hundreds
of
text
messages
he
sent
to
a
woman
he
has
said
was
a
friend
but
who
dawn
gibbons
lawyers
suggest
was
a
mistress
a
state
employee
filed
a
lawsuit
last
month
claiming
that
she
was
removed
from
her
post
on
the
belief
that
she
had
leaked
the
messages
microsoft
plans
to
report
on
monday
that
the
security
of
its
windows
operating
system
has
significantly
improved
while
at
the
same
time
the
threat
of
computer
viruses
fraud
and
other
online
scourges
has
become
much
more
serious
the
company
blames
organized
crime
naive
users
and
its
competitors
for
the
deteriorating
situation
in
the
latest
edition
of
its
twiceayear
security
intelligence
report
microsoft
said
that
the
amount
of
malicious
or
potentially
harmful
software
removed
from
windows
computers
grew
by
43
percent
during
the
first
half
of
2008
the
company
said
improvements
in
security
for
its
windows
vista
operating
system
and
security
updates
to
the
previous
windows
xp
system
had
made
such
software
a
less
attractive
target
for
attackers
instead
they
have
shifted
their
attention
to
security
holes
in
individual
programs
during
the
first
half
of
the
year
90
percent
of
newly
reported
vulnerabilities
involved
applications
and
only
10
percent
affected
operating
systems
according
to
the
report
microsoft
executives
said
they
were
pleased
with
the
progress
made
since
the
company
was
shaken
by
a
series
of
destructive
programs
that
spread
rapidly
around
the
world
over
the
internet
beginning
in
2003
but
they
said
that
unless
software
development
practices
change
throughout
the
industry
any
improvements
in
the
security
of
windows
would
be
meaningless
this
story
is
real
said
george
stathakopoulos
general
manager
for
microsofts
security
engineering
and
communications
group
referring
to
the
improvement
in
the
companys
engineering
practices
now
we
have
a
thirdparty
problem
and
its
something
we
have
to
go
solve
security
researchers
said
they
were
sympathetic
to
microsofts
plight
the
only
thing
that
microsoft
can
patch
is
their
own
software
said
patrik
runald
chief
security
adviser
for
fsecure
a
computer
security
firm
in
finland
thats
not
what
the
bad
guys
are
using
to
get
into
computers
these
days
its
certainly
a
challenge
microsoft
and
the
computer
industry
have
also
been
unable
to
solve
the
socalled
dancing
pony
problem
that
refers
to
the
propensity
of
many
computer
users
to
click
on
enticing
links
in
their
email
or
to
visit
seductive
but
malicious
web
sites
leaving
them
vulnerable
to
trojan
horse
downloads
and
other
infections
over
the
last
three
years
the
computer
security
industry
has
been
fighting
a
losing
battle
as
the
ability
of
computer
criminals
to
profit
from
identity
theft
and
a
variety
of
other
scams
has
led
to
the
development
of
a
robust
underground
industry
generating
viruses
and
other
socalled
malware
microsoft
has
tried
to
combat
the
problem
by
building
a
variety
of
safeguards
into
its
operating
systems
and
its
internet
explorer
browser
with
mixed
success
the
user
account
control
feature
of
windows
vista
which
popped
up
an
endless
stream
of
warnings
that
irritated
users
proved
to
be
one
of
the
key
factors
in
the
poor
reception
for
vista
last
week
in
los
angeles
the
company
said
it
had
entirely
reworked
the
user
interface
of
its
new
windows
7
operating
system
to
minimize
user
frustration
in
comparing
web
browser
vulnerabilities
in
windows
xp
and
windows
vista
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
the
new
report
found
that
while
microsoft
could
be
blamed
for
half
of
the
top
10
vulnerabilities
in
windows
xp
the
top
10
browser
vulnerabilities
under
vista
all
came
from
thirdparty
addon
software
from
companies
like
apple
and
realnetworks
a
companion
report
published
by
jeffrey
r
jones
a
microsoft

claims
that
microsoft
is
fixing
securityrelated
bugs
about
three
times
as
fast
as
three
of
its
rivals
apple
ubuntu
and
red

an
apple
spokesman
bill
evans

microsoft
had
previously
issued
similar
reports
and
declined
to
comment
beyond
saying
that
the
data
was
not
supported
by
users
experience
of
infections
microsoft
has
a
unique
vantage
point
from
which
to
monitor
the
world
of
malware
and
other
threats
because
it
receives
automated
data
both
from
free
software
it
has
given
to
users
like
the
malicious
software
removal
tool
and
from
specialized
internet

systems
that
monitor

it
also
receives
data
about

on
more
than
a
halfbillion
personal

the
current
report
indicates
that
malware
infection
rates
are
generally
higher
in
developing
countries
and
regions
than
in
developed
ones
infection
rates
range
from
18
for

1000
computers
in

to
above
764
for

of
255

in
the
last
six
months
somewhere
in
a
corner
of

just
five

before
the
presidential
election
that
more
than
a
few
pundits
have
declared
he
will
lose
sen
john
mccain
sat
in
the
back
of
his
campaign
bus
telling
his
favorite
henny
youngman
jokes
no
one
laughed
harder
than
he
did
no
one
is
suggesting
that
mccain
is
ecstatic
that
he
is
behind
in
the
polls
or
that
the
cognoscenti
as
he
puts
it
have
written
us
off
but
in
the
frantic
last
days
of
his
nearly
twoyear
second
quest
for
the
presidency
mccain
has
liberated
himself
from
the
irritable
edgy
candidate
of
a
month
ago
he
has
by
all
appearances
decided
he
will
get
to
tuesday
by
having
a
good
time
if
we
were
10
points
up
wed
all
be
a
little
bit
happier
said
mark

you
throw
a

at
the

and
he
fights
all
the
harder
mccains
days
begin
earlier
than
they
used
to
around
6
am
for
morning
television
and
radio
interviews
that
he
races
through
in
5
and
10
minute
bites
afterward
the
drill
is
the
same
as
it
has
been
from
the
start
he
and
his
aides
assemble
with
coffee
in
his
hotel
suite
go
over
the

for
the

check
out
the

and
lately
pore
over

during

gets
almost
no

strewn
all
over
his

and

slumped
in
his

in
the

mccain
takes
an

if
he
needs

but
in
these
last
days
there
is
scant
sleep
on
the

he
planned
to

then
rest
briefly
and
head
to

for

on
the
courthouse
steps
of
the
old
territorial
capital
of
prescott
the
town
where
he
has
ended
all
his
senate
campaigns
he
was
set
to
arrive
at
his
condominium
in
phoenix
sometime
after
2
am
on
election
day
as
sen
barack
obama
spends
the
last
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
donated
to
his
presidential
campaign
the
debate
over
how
future
campaigns
will
be
financed
is
set
to
begin
in
earnest
both
candidates
have
campaigned
as
reformers
and
declared
that
restoring
the
public
financing
system
for
presidential
campaigns
would
be
a
priority
in
their
administration
but
obama
apparently
did
not
absorb
much
by
way
of
political
cost
when
he
broke
a
pledge
to
accept
public
financing
if
his
opponent
did
as
well
obama
built
a
huge
financial
advantage
over
the
republican
nominee
sen
john
mccain
which
may
have
written
the
epitaph
for
the
current
system
democrats
in
particular
who
have
traditionally
supported
limits
on
campaign
spending
are
grappling
with
whether
they
can
embrace
obamas
example
without
being
seen
as
hypocritical
they
are
keenly
aware
that
they
have
developed
through
the
internet
a
commanding
fundraising
advantage
over
republicans
much
like
the
directmail
money
machine
that
conservatives
used
to
lord
over
them
i
think
there
is
going
to
be
tremendous
reluctance
on
our
side
to
yield
any
of
that
advantage
said
tad
devine
who
was
a
senior
strategist
for
sen
john
f
kerrys
presidential
campaign
in
2004
an
oct
28
usa
todaygallup
poll
found
most
americans
did
not
even
know
who
was
taking
public
financing
and
who
was
not
only
mccain
opted
for
the
84
million
in
public
financing
but
the
survey
also
found
most
of
those
polled
supported
limits
on
campaign
spending
house
and
senate
leadership
aides
said
it
was
highly
unlikely
that
the
issue
would
earn
much
attention
next
year
given
other
priorities
like
the
economy
and
the
war
in
iraq
there
is
also
the
matter
of
the
brewing
debate
among
democrats
who
will
probably
control
congress
over
whether
such
limits
are
even
warranted
advocates
for
tighter
restrictions
on
campaign
finance
said
they
were
alarmed
by
the
more
than
15
billion
that
had
been
raised
by
the
presidential
candidates
in
this
years
primary
and
general
elections

the
first
time
the
presidential
aspirants
have
topped
1
billion
the
obama
campaign
raised
640
million
the
mccain
camp
less
than
250
million
the
advocates
said
that
they
were
poised
to
begin
aggressively
lobbying
for
changes
to
the
public
financing
system
and
that
they
hoped
the
issue
would
be
taken
up
quickly
by
the
new
president
and
congress
chinese
regulators
said
over
the
weekend
that
they
had
confiscated
and
destroyed
more
than
3600
tons
of
animal
feed
tainted
with
melamine
an
industrial
chemical
that
has
contaminated
food
supplies
in
china
and
led
to
global
recalls
of
chinese
dairy
products
in
what
appeared
to
be
chinas
biggest
food
safety
crackdown
in
years
the
government
also
said
saturday
that
it
had
closed
238
feed
makers
in
a
series
of
nationwide
sweeps
that
involved
more
than
369000
government
inspectors
the
aggressive
moves
come
amid
growing
worries
that
the
animal
feed
industry
could
be
contaminated
by
melamine
endangering
the
national
food
supply
and
posing
a
health
threat
to
consumers
in
the
past
week
and
a
half
eggs
produced
in
three
provinces
were
found
to
be
tainted
with
high
levels
of
melamine
and
in
september
melaminetainted
infant
formula
supplies
were
blamed
for
sickening
more
than
50000
children
and
causing
at
least
four
deaths
regulators
in
the
southern
province
of
guangdong
which
has
about
80
million
people
and
is
a
major
manufacturing
center
near
hong
kong
said
they
had
discovered
6
tons
of
melaminetainted
animal
feed
an
official
at
the
agriculture
ministry
said
that
the
government
would
mete
out
harsh
punishment
to
those
who
were
deliberately
adding
melamine
to
animal
feed
but
government
officials
also
said
that
chinas
animal
feed
supply
was
largely
safe
and
that
the
quality
of
feed
had
improved
in
recent
years
they
insisted
that
only
a
small
number
of
rogue
operators
had
deliberately
added
melamine
to
feed
often
using
it
as
cheap
filler
to
save
money
the
government
response
was
similarly
reassuring
early
last
year
when
several
animal
feed
makers
were
caught
exporting
melaminetainted
feed
ingredients
to
the
united
states
and
other
countries
resulting
in
contaminated
pet
food
supplies
that
sickened
and
killed
cats
and
dogs
that
case
led
to
the
largest
pet
food
recall
in
american
history
melamine
dealers
in
china
said
in
interviews
last
year
and
as
recently
as
friday
that
it
was
not
uncommon
for
animal
feed
producers
to
buy
melamine
scrap
the
cheaper
waste
left
over
after
producing
melamine
products
and
to
use
it
as
filler
still
some
food
safety
officials
are
asking
consumers
not
to
be
too
alarmed
although
the
contaminated
eggs
found
in
hong
kong
exceeded
the
government
limit
for
melamine
a
young
child
would
have
to
consume
about
two
dozen
of
the
eggs
in
a
single
day
to
become
sick
they
said
eight
paramilitary
soldiers
were
killed
and
five
were
wounded

the

reported
that

in

had
threatened
to
scrap
a

if
the

did
not

attacks
against

much
of
south
africas
selfimage
is
built
on
the
iconography
of
the
african

congress
the
long
walk
to

the
devotion
to
democratic
principles
the
racially
tolerant
rainbow

the
three
national
elections
since
the
end
of

the
anc
has
won
each

with
the
overwhelming
support
of
voters
so
this
weekends
convention
led
by
an
anc
breakaway
faction
was
somewhat
jarring
dissidents
repeatedly
described
the
party
they
once
loved
as

sunday
at
a

conference
meant
to
trumpet
what
the
convention
had
accomplished
indeed
this
weekend
may
go
down
in
south
african
history
as
a
watershed
a
time
when
6400
delegates
from
around
the
nation
charted
a
new
political
course
that
loosened
the
ancs
grip
then
again
the
movement
might
turn
out
to
be
a
flop
a
lot
of
batting
of
wings
without
any
sustained
takeoff
the
months
ahead
will
tell
the
tale
a
tug
of
war
is
under
way
for
the
loyalty
of
party
members
there
are
rumors
whispers

the
sunday
times
one
of

leading

reports
that
100

if

they
manage

brave

in

the
wealthy
gathered
yesterday
at
their
fancy
convention
in
the
suburbs
jacob
zuma
the
party
president
derisively
remarked
sunday
at
a
rally
in
the
township
of
soweto
that
drew
about
20000
people
theres
not
much
they
said
a
cell
phone
was
pressed
to
sen
barack
obamas
ear
as
he
slouched
down
in
a
black
leather
chair
in
the
front
cabin
of
his
campaign
airplane
he
leaned
away
from
the
headrest
where
his
name
is
spelled
out
in
blue
stitching
a
few
miles
away
thousands
of
people
streamed
into
jfk
stadium
at
parkview
high
school
for
a
latenight
rally
on
saturday
but
obama
stayed
on
his
chartered
boeing
757
as
he
spoke
by
conference
call
to
thousands
of
his
team
leaders
around
the
country
the
volunteers
who
form
the
ranks
of
an
army
that
he
hopes
will
give
him
an
edge
in
the
waning
hours
of
the
presidential
race
as
he
pressed
his
right
hand
to
his
forehead
his
sober
expression
seemed
at
odds
with
the
confident
gleam
in
the
eyes
of
his
advisers
while
obama
smiles
less
than
he
once
did
gauging
his
mood
simply
by
looking
at
him
is
risky
for
a
man
whose
flatline
temperament
has
seldom
spiked
along
the
rocky
points
of
his
journey
in
a
campaign
where
he
has
slogged
through
more
competitive
election
days
than
any
recent
nominee
only
one
more
lies
ahead
and
it
is
the
long
path
of
the
democratic
primary
which
lurched
from
the
ups
of
iowa
to
the
downs
of
ohio
that
his
friends
say
provided
obama
with
a
steady
equilibrium
as
he
enters
this
final
turn
in
the
race
for
the
white
house
as
painful
as
the
primary
season
was
and
how
agitating
it
could
be
it
turned
out
to
be
a
blessing
for
him
said
eric
whitaker
a
longtime
friend
from
chicago
who
joined
obama
aboard
the
crowded
campaign
plane
for
the
last
three
days
but
my
role
now
is
to
keep
him
loose
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
his
world
the
lines
in
obamas
face
have
grown
a
bit
deeper
since
he
started
his
campaign
with
the
notches
of
gray
hair
along
his
temples
far
more
pronounced
he
often
carries
the
look
of
exhaustion
but
flying
the
other
night
to
nevada
where
he
arrived
after
midnight
obama
passed
on
the
chance
to
take
much
of
a
nap
instead
he
walked
around
the
cabin
of
his
airplane
which
is
about
the
size
of
a
bedroom
and
talked
about
a
favorite
diversion

the
coming
basketball
season

as
he
took
care
not
to
step
on
a
senior
foreign
policy
adviser
mark
lippert
who
was
asleep
on
the
floor
in
the
last
days
on
the
trail
he
is
finishing
ghost
wars
the
secret
history
of
the
cia
afghanistan
and
bin
laden
and
taking
an
occasional
glance
at
us
weekly
he
reads
at
least
two
newspapers
a
day
vigilantly
checks
his
blackberry
for
updates
on
earlyvoting
tallies
and
browses
briefing
books
in
a
marathon
when
you
are
on
mile
20
you
start
getting
tired
but
when
you
are
on
mile
25
you
dont
said
lippert
who
has
grown
familiar
with
obamas
travel
rhythms
while
accompanying
him
on
the
four
foreign
trips
he
has
taken
since
becoming
a
senator
thats
where
hes
at
whatever
emotion
he
feels
as
his
candidacy
draws
to
a
close
he
displays
little
of
it
either
in
public
appearances
or
private
conversations
with
his
close
advisers
the
air
of
confidence
that
he
exudes
which
some
critics
castigate
as
arrogance
grew
in
part
out
of
the
primary
when
he
worked
to
avoid
perceptions
that
he
was
weak
or
not
ready
but
now
he
is
described
by
friends
as
feeling
as
though
he
has
been
thoroughly
tested
and
is
prepared
to
take
on
the
job
he
has
spent
22
months
fighting
for
still
it
is
hard
for
even
those
closest
to
obama
to
fathom
what
these
days
are
precisely
like
even
for
the
imperturbable

often
inscrutable

senator
from
illinois
his
world
is
awash
in
powerful
conflicting
emotions
the
realization
presumably
that
he
may
be
about
to
become
president
the
huge
optimism
that
he
has
unleashed
evident
in
the
crowds
he
is
drawing
and
something
he
has
told
aides
worries
him
a
bit
given
the
expectations
set
for
him
the
weighty
thinking
he
is
gradually
giving
to
how
he
would
staff
a
government
and
deal
with
a
transition
in
such
a
difficult
time
all
of
this
is
taking
place
at
a
time
where
the
woman
who
played
a
large
role
in
raising
him
his
grandmother
is
approaching
death
what
if
i
disappoint
people
valerie
jarrett
a
close
friend
and
adviser
recalled
obama
asking
at
several
points
throughout
the
campaign
thats
what
gives
him
the
energy
to
keep
getting
up
every
day
it
has
been
months
since
obama
has
ventured
with
any
regularity
to
the
back
of
his
plane
where
the
journalists
sit
the
one
time
he
played
the
board
game
taboo
on
a
crosscountry
flight
to
oregon
is
a
distant
memory
he
has
not
taken
questions
for
so
long
that
reporters
have
taken
to
shouting
at
him
as
he
boards
his
plane
as
he
climbed
up
the
steps
of
his
airplane
here
on
sunday
morning
headed
for
ohio
a
reporter
shouted
to
question
why
he
hadnt
held
a
news
conference
in
weeks
i
will
obama
said
on
wednesday
on
a
final
weekend
pass
through
electoral
battlegrounds
that
spanned
three
time
zones
the
electoral
climate
and
his
campaign
organization
provide
him
the
luxury
of
focusing
on
states
that
favored
the
republican
ticket
four
years
ago
but
when
his
democratic
crowds
jeer
at
the
mere
mention
of
sen
john
mccain
he
offers
a
gentle
scolding
you
dont
need
to
boo
you
just
need
to
vote
it
is
a
true
crowdpleaser
and
he
reprises
it
in
city
after
city
his
crowds
have
rarely
been
larger
or
more
enthusiastic

often
perhaps
more
outwardly
so
than
the
candidate
himself
these
days
obama
is
racing
through
his
speeches
whittling
down
a
message
that
once
stretched
for
more
than
an
hour
to
a
disciplined
30
minutes
he
works
the
rope
line
at
every
stop
but
taking
a
closer
look
you
realize
that
its
as
much
for
a
few
photographs
as
for
a
lot
of
handshakes
at
each
event
though
he
stays
long
enough
to
sign
a
stack
of
books
for
supporters
during
a
rally
outside
orlando
fla
the
other
night
where
he
was
joined
for
the
first
time
on
stage
by
former
president
bill
clinton
he
was
visibly
chilly
in
the
unusually
cool
air
with
a
temperature
that
dipped
into
the
40s
he
had
hoped
to
wear
a
coat
but
clinton
did
not
so
obama
came
to
the
stage
without
one
not
so
the
next
night
in
virginia
where
a
cool
and
damp
chill
also
hung
in
the
air
i
did
decide
to
wear
a
coat
because
you
want
a
president
who
has
sense
obama
told
the
crowd
from
behind
the
podium
where
he
was
covered
in
a
black
wool
overcoat
while
he
may
not
be
coasting
to
the
finish
line
hes
not
running
as
hard
as
he
did
during
his
battle
with
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
for
the
democratic
nomination
on
sunday
he
was
in
the
gym
of
the
doubletree
hotel
here
shortly
after
6
am
but
he
spent
some
time
with
his
wife
and
daughters
before
boarding
his
plane
at
930
am
he
didnt
arrive
for
his
first
public
event
of
the
day
at
the
ohio
statehouse
in
columbus
until
1
pm
his
campaign
schedule
like
obama
himself
can
be
slow
to
start
in
the
morning
but
runs
late
into
the
night
after
appearing
with
bruce
springsteen
at
a
rally
in
cleveland
followed
by
a
stop
in
cincinnati
obama
was
not
scheduled
to
arrive
at
his
hotel
in
jacksonville
fla
until
after
1
am
on
monday
if
there
is
a
whiff
of
nostalgia
surrounding
the
obama
campaign
in
these
final
hours
before
the
election
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
emanating
from
the
candidate
himself
he
is
eager
to
be
finished
campaigning
several
of
his
friends
said
and
for
months
has
been
immersing
himself
in
the
work
of
the
presidency
well
before
he
knows
if
it
will
ever
be
his
he
spends
far
less
time
on
the
telephone
these
days
making
political
calls
to
local
democratic
chairmen
his
call
list
now
includes
officials
in
washington
including
treasury
secretary
henry
m
paulson
jr
to
whom
he
spoke
to
several
times
a
day
for
weeks
about
the
government
rescue
plan
and
he
is
in
frequent
conversations
with
congressional
leaders
over
how
to
proceed
should
he
win
on
tuesday
on
saturday
morning
obama
met
in
his
hotel
suite
at
caesars
palace
in
las
vegas
with
sen
harry
reid
of
nevada
the
majority
leader
they
spent
about
45
minutes
together
with
reid
ticking
through
a
list
of
items
sketched
on
a
note
card
in
his
breast
pocket
obama
also
spoke
about
how
his
life
has
changed
a
point
that
was
driven
home
on
friday
night
when
he
went
home
to
see
his
daughters
for
halloween
and
grew
agitated
when
he
felt
that
a
group
of
reporters
and
photographers
had
crowded
him
he
said
he
likes
to
go
out
trickortreating
but
he
cant
anymore
reid
said
in
an
interview
recalling
the
conversation
he
had
with
obama
he
said
he
guessed
he
could
have
worn
a
barack
obama
mask
one
of
the
greatest
frustrations
of
his
candidacy

being
away
from
his
wife
michelle
and
his
two
daughters
malia
and
sasha

will
come
to
an
end
win
or
lose
when
his
plane
touched
down
on
saturday
afternoon
in
pueblo
colo
his
step
carried
an
extra
lilt
it
was
not
because
of
the
place
that
he
finds
himself
in
the
closing
moments
of
his
campaign
but
because
his
two
daughters
were
standing
on
the
breezy
tarmac
waiting
to
be
scooped
up
by
their
daddy
a
cell
phone
was
pressed
to
sen
barack
obamas
ear
as
he
slouched
down
in
a
black
leather
chair
in
the
front
cabin
of
his
campaign
airplane
a
few
miles
away
thousands
of
people
streamed
into
jfk
stadium
at
parkview
high
school
for
a
latenight
rally
on
saturday
but
obama
stayed
on
his
chartered
boeing
757
as
he
spoke
by
conference
call
to
thousands
of
his
team
leaders
around
the
country
the
volunteers
who
form
the
ranks
of
an
army
that
he
hopes
will
give
him
an
edge
in
the
waning
hours
of
the
presidential
race
as
he
pressed
his
right
hand
to
his
forehead
his
sober
expression
seemed
at
odds
with
the
confident
gleam
in
the
eyes
of
his
advisers
while
obama
smiles
less
than
he
once
did
gauging
his
mood
simply
by
looking
at
him
is
risky
for
a
man
whose
flatline
temperament
has
seldom
spiked
along
the
rocky
points
of
his
journey
the
lines
in
obamas
face
have
grown
a
bit
deeper
since
he
started
his
campaign
with
the
notches
of
gray
hair
along
his
temples
far
more
pronounced
he
often
carries
the
look
of
exhaustion
but
whatever
emotion
he
feels
as
his
candidacy
draws
to
a
close
he
displays
little
of
it
it
is
hard
for
even
those
closest
to
obama
to
fathom
what
these
days
are
precisely
like
for
him
his
world
is
awash
in
powerful
conflicting
emotions
the
realization
presumably
that
he
may
be
about
to
become
president
the
huge
optimism
that
he
has
unleashed
evident
in
the
crowds
he
is
drawing
and
something
he
has
told
aides
worries
him
a
bit
given
the
expectations
set
for
him
the
weighty
thinking
he
is
gradually
giving
to
how
he
would
staff
a
government
and
deal
with
a
transition
in
such
a
difficult
time
all
of
this
is
taking
place
at
a
time
where
the
woman
who
played
a
large
role
in
raising
him
his
grandmother
is
approaching
death
what
if
i
disappoint
people
valerie
jarrett
a
close
friend
and
adviser
recalled
obama
asking
at
several
points
throughout
the
campaign
thats
what
gives
him
the
energy
to
keep
getting
up
every
day
as
he
climbed
up
the
steps
of
his
airplane
here
on
sunday

john

have
pledged
to
cut

without
carving
into
the

of

both
have
said
they
would
protect

has
warned
against
repeating
historic
trends
in
which
the

cut

for

of

we
basically
gutted
our

i
after

ii
in
certain
ways
after

certainly
after
vietnam
and
after
the
end
of
the

gates
said
experience
is
the
ability
to
recognize
a
mistake
when
you
make
it
again
gates
acknowledges
that
military
spending
is
almost
certain
to
level
off
and
he
expressed
a
goal
that

at

keep
pace
with

during

the
press
on

within
minutes
the
video
was
on
the
web
but
the
clip
was
not
rushed
onto
youtube
it
was
msnbccom
the
networks
sister
entity
online
that
showed
the
video
hours
before
television
viewers
on
the
west
coast
could
watch
the
interview
for
themselves
old
media
apparently
can
learn
new
media
tricks
not
since
1960
when
john
f
kennedy
won
in
part
because
of
the
increasingly
popular
medium
of
television
has
changing
technology
had
such
an
impact
on
the
political
campaigns
and
the
organizations
covering
them
for
many
viewers
the
2008
election
has
become
a
kind
of
hybrid
in
which
the
dividing
line
between
online
and
off
broadcast
and
cable
pop
culture
and
civic
culture
has
been
all
but
obliterated
many
of
the
media
outlets
influencing
the
2008
election
simply
were
not
around
in
2004
youtube
did
not
exist
and
facebook
barely
reached
beyond
the
ivy
league
there
was
no
huffington
post
to
encourage
citizen
reporters
so
obamas
comment
about
voters
clinging
to
guns
or
religion
may
have
passed
unnoticed
these
sites
and
countless
others
have
redefined
how
many
americans
get
their
political
news
when
viewers
settle
in
tuesday
night
to
watch
the
election
returns
they
will
also
check
text
messages
for
alerts
browse
the
web
for
exit
poll
results
and
watch
videos
distributed
by
the
campaigns
and
many
folks
will
let
go
of
the
mouse
only
to
pick
up
the
remote
and
sample
an
array
of
cable
channels
with
election
coverage

from
comedy
central
to
bbc
america
but
as
nbcs
decision
to
release
the
powell
clip
early
shows
the
networks
and
their
newspaper
counterparts
have
not
simply
waited
to
be
overtaken
instead
they
have
made
specific
efforts
to
engage
audiences
with
interactive
features
allowing
their
content
to
be
used
in
unanticipated
ways
and
in
many
efforts
breaking
out
of
the
boundaries
of
the
morning
paper
and
the
evening
newscast
old
media
outlets

the
networks
the
newspapers

learned
a
lot
of
lessons
from
the
last
cycle
and
didnt
allow
others
to
own
the
online
space
this
time
said
rick
klein
the
senior
political
reporter
for
abc
news
some
of
those
lessons
have
been
painful
consider
what
has
changed
since
the
last
presidential
election
four
years
ago
the
network
news
operations
were
still
the
goto
source
on
election
night
with
a
total
audience
of
38
million
in
prime
time
compared
with
17
million
for
the
three
cable
news
channels
on
tuesday
the
ratings
race
will
surely
be
tighter
on
a
historic
night
in
august
when
a
black
man
became
the
first
endorsed
candidate
of
a
major
political
party
the
biggest
audience
of
all
belonged
to
cnn
some
of
this
began
back
in
2006
but
i
think
that
cable
news
has
transformed
the
way
that
elections
are
covered
said
david
bohrman
the
washington
bureau
chief
for
cnn
i
dont
think
networks
are
irrelevant
but
network
news
is
less
relevant
than
it
has
been
but
those
who
suggest
that
2008
is
a
postnetwork
affair
should
consider
that
while
gov
sarah
palin
of
alaska
was
something
of
a
fixation
on
the
web
it
was
her
interview
with
katie
couric
the
anchor
of
the
cbs
evening
news
and
the
impersonation
by
tina
fey
on
nbcs
saturday
night
live
that
defined
her
in
the
public
imagination
when
obamas
campaign
sought
to
make
one
last
push
with
a
30minute
infomercial
it
bought
time
on
three
major
networks
using
money
harvested
on
one
platform

the
web

to
buy
time
on
another

broadcast
television
we
should
be
careful
of
these
zerosum
games
where
the
new
media
drives
out
the
old
said
andrew
heyward
a
former
president
of
cbs
news
who
is
now
a
senior
adviser
to
marketspace
a
consulting
firm
owned
by
the
monitor
group
i
think
what
we
see
is
growing
sophistication
about
making
the
channels
work
together
effectively
the
republicans
have
made
a
habit
of
running
against
the
media
in
elections
past
this
year
the
mainstream
media
found
itself
at
times
running
against
both
parties
perhaps
drawing
on
obamas
background
as
a
community
organizer
his
campaign
decided
early
on
to
build
a
social
network
that
would
flank
and
in
some
cases
outflank
traditional
news
media
with
a
facebook
group
that
had
23
million
adherents
and
a
huge
push
on
youtube

last
week
alone
the
campaign
uploaded
70
videos
many
of
them
tailored
to
battleground
states

the
campaign
used
peertopeer
communication
to
build
a
juggernaut
that
did
not
depend
on
the
whims
and
choices
of
the
medias
collective
brain
trust
the
campaign
mined
its
online
community
not
just
for
money
but
for
content
a
video
titled
four
days
in
denver
about
the
obama
campaign
had
the
kind
of
access
that
journalists
would
kill
for
including
the
candidate
working
over
his
acceptance
speech
with
a
staff
member
and
showing
the
family
backstage
making
ready
for
their
moment
in
the
spotlight
it
looked
like
a
bigtime
network
get
but
it
was
produced
by
the
campaign
itself
were
constantly
experimenting
with
videos
said
joe
rospars
obamas
newmedia
director
there
arent
hard
and
fast
rules
about
what
will
inspire
supporters
or
explain
things
clearly
the
most
popular
videos
on
barackobamacom
werent
tv
ads
they
were
biographical
videos
and
webonly
recordings
mccain
in
part
because
he
appealed
to
a
less
digital
demographic
made
sparser
use
of
the
web
but
republicans
were
not
immune
to
the
charms
of
new
media
the
web
never
forgets
giving
new
life
to
events
from
several
years
ago
no
one
knows
the
impact
of
quasipermanency
on
the
web
yet
but
it
surely
has
changed
the
political
world
said
allan
louden
a
professor
who
teaches
a
course
on
digital
politics
at
wake
forest
university
the
role
of
gatekeepers
and
archivists
have
been
dispersed
to
everyone
with
internet
access
and
late
last
month
the
mccain
campaign
solicited
users
to
come
up
with
their
own
joe
the
plumber
videos
and
showed
the
results
on
its
web
site
i
think
that
this
time
around
campaigns
got
used
to
the
fact
that
anything
that
they
put
out
there
could
be
pirated
remixed
mashedup
and
recirculated
said
henry
jenkins
the
author
of
convergence
culture
where
old
and
new
media
collide
and
a
professor
at
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
it
is
a
much
more
rapid
environment
raw
footage
of
political
speeches

which
no
network
except
cspan
considers
hot
content

racked
up
huge
numbers
with
5
million
views
since
march
obamas
37minute
speech
about
race
is
the
most
popular
video
on
his
youtube
channel
to
compete
major
media
companies
had
to
change
how
they
produced
their
coverage
before
almost
every
big
interview
of
the
year

abcs
interview
with
john
edwards
about
his
extramarital
affair
for
instance

the
networks
released
excerpts
on
their
web
sites
snl
videos
proved
to
be
particularly
popular
online
feys
impressions
were
viewed
more
than
50
million
times
the
idea
that
something
can
be
seen
more
online
than
on
tv
and
arguably
have
more
influence
that
way
is
a
tipping
point
heyward
said
politically
oriented
video
much
of
it
topical
and
much
of
the
juicier
bits
lifted
from
network
programming
is
everywhere
on
the
web
youtube
videos
mentioning
either
obama
or
mccain
have
been
viewed
23
billion
times
according
to
the
measurement
firm
tubemogul
a
pew
research
center
survey
conducted
in
october
found
that
39
percent
of
registered
voters
had
watched
campaign
videos
online
what
is
striking
here
is
not
the
dominance
of
any
one
medium
but
the
integration
of
various
channels
said
lee
rainie
the
director
of
the
pew
internet
ampamp
american
life
project
by
the
time
the
conventions
rolled
around
some
networks
realized
the
game
had
changed
couric
christened
her
own
youtube
channel
and
was
turned
loose
in
web
extras
but
network
news
divisions
are
expensive
operations
based
on
a
television
business
model
they
cant
be
run
on
the
relatively
small
money
that
online
advertising
draws
but
they
cant
compete
for
audiences
if
they
ignore
the
web
at
a
time
when
almost
anyone
can
check
voter
turnout
in
certain
neighborhoods
in
cuyahoga
county
i
dont
think
everyone
is
going
to
sit
there
and
wait
to
be
spoonfed
the
election
results
in
the
order
brian
williams
thinks
is
appropriate
said
joan
walsh
the
editor
of
salon
and
a
frequent
television
commentator
on
the
election
referring
to
a
closely
watched
county
in
ohio
perhaps
the
only
thing
that
could
be
predicted
with
any
reliability
is
that
viewers
who
now
watch
cable
news
on
a
set
that
looks
like
the
desktop

running
streams
of
data
framing
the
main
page

while
streaming
video
on
a
nearby
laptop
will
probably
be
watching
just
one
screen
that
can
do
all
of
those
things
four
years
from
now
there
was
a
palpable
hunger
for
information
and
data
about
this
election
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
media
said
mark
jurkowitz
of
the

much
of

selfimage
is
built
on
the
iconography
of

the

the

to

the

the

since
the
end
of

the

has
won
each

with
the
overwhelming
support
of
voters
so
this
weekends
convention
led
by
an
anc
breakaway
faction
was
somewhat
jarring
dissidents
repeatedly
described
the
party
they
once
loved
as
now
being
authoritarian
hypocritical
and
corrupt
leaders
at
the

predicted
a
stream
of
defections

and
victory

meant
to
trumpet
what
the
convention
had
accomplished
indeed
this
weekend
may
go
down
in
south
african
history
as
a
watershed
a
time
when
6400
delegates
from
around
the
nation
charted
a
new
political
course
that
loosened
the
ancs
grip
then
again
the
movement
might
turn
out
to
be
a
flop
a
lot
of
batting
of

without
any
sustained

the

ahead
will
tell
the

a

the

derisively
remarked
sunday
at
a
rally
in
the
township
of
soweto
that
drew
about
20000
people
theres
not
much
they
said
however
much
it
was

at
the

drew
the
kind
of
news
coverage
ordinarily
reserved
for
extraordinary
events
with
banner
headlines
like
the
fight
is
on
and
hungry
for

not

were

dissidents
present
at
the
convention
but
also
the
leaders
of
most
of

political
parties

allowed
to
lambaste

on

podium
as
the

that
a
broad

was
possible
zuma
speaking
in

seized
on
the
notion
of

and
their
strange
bedfellows

times

evasive
about

said
that

was
at

500000
and
that
an
accounting
of

would

the

mbeki
has
played
no
visible
role
in

faction
but
many
of
its
leaders
are
close
to
him
according
to
shilowa
the
party
will
be
officially
established
on
dec
16
in
bloemfontein
where
the
anc
africas
oldest
liberation
movement
was
formed
in

a

for
the
new

will
be
selected
in

next
few
days
he
said
the
organization
has
tentatively
been
called
the
south
african
national
congress
but
the
anc
has
gone
to
court
in
an
attempt
to
stop
use
of
a
name
so
similar
to
its
own
private
equity
firms
embarked
on
one
of
the
biggest
spending
sprees
in
corporate
history
for
nearly
three
years
using
borrowed
money
to
gobble
up
huge
swaths
of
industries
and
some
of
the
biggest
names

neiman
marcus
metrogoldwynmayer
and
toys
r
us
among
them
the
new
owners
then
saddled
the
companies
with
the
billions
of
dollars
of
debt
used
to
buy
them
but
now
many
of
the
loans
and
bonds
sold
to
finance
the
deals
are
about
to
come
due
at
the
worst
possible
time
like
homeowners
with
an
adjustable
rate
mortgage
that
just
went
up
some
of
private
equitys
titans
are
facing
a
huge
squeeze
and
that
is
coming
at
the
same
time
as
consumers
are
staying
home
with
their
wallets
closed
already
this
year
big
retailers
backed
by
private
equity
like
linens
n
things
mervyns
and
steve
ampamp
barrys
have
filed
for
bankruptcy
and
analysts
expect
an
even
broader
array
of
companies
backed
by
private
equity

including
resorts
like
harrahs
entertainment
and
lenders
like
gmac
the
financing
arm
of
general
motors

to
face
even
more
pressure
as
profits
shrivel
and
creditors
come
knocking
theres
absolutely
going
to
a
lot
of
pain
to
go
around
said
josh
lerner
a
professor
of
investment
banking
at
harvard
business
school
who
wrote
a
seminal
paper
on
private
equity
the
big
question
is
how
apocalyptic
it
will
be
the
shakeout
could
have
enormous
implications
for
the
economy
people
who
work
for
companies
owned
by
private
equity
firms
could
lose
their
jobs
as
firms
cut
costs
to
meet
their
debt
obligations
and
private
equity
firms
like
apollo
management
which
owns
harrahs
and
linens
n
things
face
deep
markdowns
on
the
value
of
their
holdings
pension
funds
and
college
endowments
that
invested
in
these
funds
in
recent
years
hoping
for
big
returns
are
likely
to
suffer
as
well
and
many
of
those
investors
could
face
a
cash
squeeze
because
they
are
probably
going
to
have
to
hold
onto
their
investments
for
years
until
the
economy
turns
around
the
dangling
other
shoe
is
now
about
to
drop
said
jeffrey
a
sonnenfeld
senior
associate
dean
of
the
yale
school
of
management
private
equity
firms
which
are
lightly
regulated
use
investors
money
to
buy
undervalued
public
companies
and
take
them
private
when
the
economy
was
booming
the
firms
made
huge
profits
by
cutting
costs
at
their
new
acquisitions
improving
operations
and
then
turning
around
and
selling
them
in
2007
at
the
height
of
the
bubble
such
deals
totaled
796
billion
or
more
than
16
percent
of
the
483
trillion
in
all
the
deals
made
globally
that
year
according
to
data
from
dealogic
firms
like
blackstone
group
and
kohlberg
kravis
roberts
ampamp
co
which
faced
an
image
problem
at
the
height
of
the
bubble
for
excessive
compensation
and
beneficial
tax
treatment
but
their
returns
were
so
high
that
even
investors
like
pension
funds
were
drawn
in
now
these
firms
built
on
enormous
amounts
of
debt
are
being
forced
to
go
back
to
the
financial
markets
just
as
those
markets
have
nearly
frozen
up
if
history
is
any
guide
the
worst
may
be
yet
to
come
steven
n
kaplan
a
professor
at
university
of
chicago
graduate
school
of
business
found
that
nearly
30
percent
of
all
big
publictoprivate
deals
made
from
1986
to
1989
defaulted
afterward
private
equity
players
were
called
in
front
of
congress
and
movies
like
wall
street
and
other
peoples
money
were
made
depicting
financiers
as
greedy
criminals
to
be
sure
many
companies
that
were
not
purchased
by
private
equity
firms
are
also
struggling
circuit
city
the
longtime
seller
of
consumer
electronics
is
trying
to
stave
off
a
bankruptcy
filing
and
publicly
traded
automakers
like
gm
are
troubled
too
gm
wants
to
merge
with
the
struggling
chrysler
which
is
owned
by
private
equity
many
industry
insiders
and
analysts
contend
that
private
equitybacked
companies
will
not
suffer
nearly
as
much
as
those
in
the
late
1980s
because
the
firms
pushed
for
better
financing
conditions
that
allow
them
to
keep
operating
even
if
they
cannot
make
their
debt
payments
for
example
in
an
effort
to
save
cash
six
of
apollos
portfolio
companies
including
claires
stores
harrahs
and
realogy
have
announced
this
year
that
they
will
pay
some
of
their
bonds
interest
payments
by
issuing
more
debt
kaplan
said
he
believed
that
while
it
isnt
going
to
be
pretty
todays
deals
are
much
less
fragile
and
used
less
leverage
he
contended
that
on
a
relative
basis
to
investment
banks
and
hedge
funds
private
equity
may
be
in
a
better
place
because
of
its
longterm
focus
stephen
a
schwarzman
chairman
of
blackstone
group
remains
committed
to
the
future
of
private
equity
the
people
rooting
for
the
collapse
of
private
equity
are
going
to
be
disappointed
he
said
while
some
companies
may
find
themselves
in
trouble
he
said
many
more
will
be
able
to
ride
out
a
downturn
in
the
economy
because
of
the
lax
financing
conditions
that
banks
agreed
to
at
the
top
of
the
market
he
added
that
he
believes
that
now
may
be
the
best
time
for
private
equity
because
of
the
investment
opportunities
amid
the
crisis
historically
downturns
are
when
the
most
money
gets
made
he
said
shares
of
blackstone
are
hovering
at
around
10
down
from
the
31
they
were
at
when
blackstone
went
public

lerner
of
the
harvard
business
school
said
that
trouble
among
private
equity
firms
would
probably
precipitate
hard
questions
about
the
compensation
and
fee
structure
in
the
industry
the
firms
generally
take
fees
of
2
percent
of
all
money
managed
and
20
percent
of
profits
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
they
try
to
head
of
the
criticism
by
returning
capital
he
said
the
problem
for
recent
deals
is
that
many
firms
waded
into
economically
sensitive
sectors
like
retailing
and
restaurants
firms
like
apollo
cerberus
capital
management
and
sun
capital
partners
purchased
several
troubled
companies
to
turn
around
from
2004
through
the
first
half
of
2007
in
the
case
of
linens

a

apollo
knew
that
it
had
a
tough
job
ahead
of
it
yet
it
still
added
lots
of

two
months
before
linens
n
things
was
acquired
it
reported
21
million
in
longterm
debt
by
dec
31
2007
that
amount
had
exploded
to
855
million
at
the
time
private
equity
firms
assumed
that
they
could
refinance
their
portfolio
companies
debt
cheaply
but
many
appear
to
have
been
blindsided
by
the
size
and
severity
of
the
credit
market
meltdown
which
has
left
lenders
unable
or
unwilling
to
loan
out
more
money
in
what
seems
a
worrisome
trend
many
bonds
of
private
equitybacked
companies
have
recently
plummeted
in
value
signaling
worries
about
their
solvency
these
include

signaling

belief
that

drawing
closer
to
a
potential

harrahs
too
was
saddled
with
a
lot
of
debt
when
it
was
taken
private
a
month
before
the
closing
of
the
harrahs
takeover
the

reported
124

in

by
june
30
that
figure
had
swollen
to
239
billion
harrahs
has
already
begun
making
selective

and
has
begun
scaling
back

even
cutting

unfortunately
the

looking

analysts

wrote
in

research
note
on

about
harrahs
while
the
company
could
be
able
to
pull
through
unscathed
the
market
is
giving
little
credit
to
do
so
the
vicepresidential
candidates
spent
the
final
frenetic
hours
of
the
2008
campaign
on
traditionally
republican
turf
with
sen
joseph
r
biden
jr
urging
democrats
to
get
to
the
polls
and
gov
sarah
palin
warning
that
the
farleft
wing
of
the
democrat
party
is
poised
to
take
over
washington
palin
addressed
large
crowds
in
florida
north
carolina
and
virginia
on
saturday
and
made
several
appearances
in
ohio
on
sunday
biden
spent
saturday
and
sunday
skittering
around
ohio
and
florida
before
heading
to
missouri
for
an
early
appearance
on
monday
it
is
no
coincidence
that
the
candidates
are
appearing
only
in
states
that
president
bush
won
in
2004
the
republican
ticket
led
by
sen
john
mccain
of
arizona
is
playing
defense
while
the
democrats
confident
they
have
locked
up
the
states
they
won
in
2004
are
seeking
new
territory
palins
message
at
its
heart
is
a
fearbased
argument
against
electing
sen
barack
obama
of
illinois
she
warns
voters
that
obama
will
raise
taxes
expand
government
capitulate
to
terrorists
and
promote
an
extreme
liberal
agenda
with
the
help
of
broader
democratic
majorities
in
congress
the
time
for
choosing
is
near
and
the
choice
is
going
to
come
down
to
what
we
believe
in
ohio
palin
said
at
a
rally
sunday
in
canton
ohio
we
believe
in
the
forward
movement
of
freedom
not
the
constant
expansion
of
government
bidens
message
has
evolved
in
recent
days
from
harsh
attacks
on
mccain
and
palin
to
a
broader
appeal
for
an
end
to
what
he
calls
the
politics
of
division
he
still
mocks
the
republican
ticket
arguing
that
they
are
not
mavericks
but
rather
mere
sidekicks
to
bush
who
would
continue
his
foreign
and
economic
policies
he
says
that
in
their
desperation
mccain
and
palin
are
using
smears
and
lies
to
impugn
obamas
character
and
patriotism
but
biden
with
an
unstated
sense
that
victory
is
within
the
democrats
grasp
has
turned
to
a
call
for
healing
a
divided
nation
he
urges
his
audiences
to
choose
hope
over
fear
we
have
to
unite
this
country
biden
said
at
a
rally
at
florida
state
university
here
on
sunday
afternoon
we
cannot
stay
blue
and
red
really
we
cannot
stay
divided
we
cant
strengthen
the
economy
if
we
are
pitted
one
against
the
other
we
cannot
move
past
the
politics
of
division
unless
we
reach
out
to
those
people
in
the
parking
lot
biden
added
referring
to
about
a
dozen
noisy
promccain
protesters
near
the
event
in
florida
on
saturday
palin
used
the
ageold
tactic
of
warning
elderly
people
that
her
opponents
were
not
committed
to
social
security
biden
did
the
same
thing
in
florida
last
week
in
virginia
she
affirmed
her
support
for
gun
owners
rights
drawing
loud
cheers
speaking
with
a
southern
twang
she
said
she
would
work
on
keeping
virginia
red
and
making
yall
prosperous
palins
crowds
have
been
enormous
and
enthusiastic
shaking
redandwhite
pompoms
and
filling

joking
that
he
looks
like
one
of
those
secret
service
guys
biden
has
been
joined
for
the
last
several
days
by
his
wife
of
31
years
jill
jacobs
biden
a
community
college
professor
she
tells
audiences
that
this
is
the
most
important
election
of
their
lifetimes
and
adds
a
few
biographical
notes
about
her
husband
including
that
he
lost
his
first
wife
and
a
young
daughter
in
a
car
accident
in
1972
when
biden
takes
the
stage

unfailingly
to
the
rising
by
bruce
springsteen

he
thanks
obama
for
choosing
him
as
his
running
mate
the
reason
im
so
thankful
he
says
is
ive
never
heard
my
wife
say
such
nice
things
about
me
in
public
biden
regularly
warns
against
complacency
and
urges
those
in
the
audience
who
have
not
voted
already
to
cast
their
ballots
early
if
possible
biden
and
palin
have
accelerated
their
schedules
now
appearing
at
as
many
as
five
rallies
a
day
in
as
many
cities
a
week
ago
two
or
three
events
a
day
was
the
norm
for
each
candidate
they
have
shortened
their
stump
speeches
and
are
spending
less
time
greeting
supporters
their
exhaustion
is
beginning
to
show
particularly
late
at
night
palins
voice
sometimes
grows
hoarse
and
biden
occasionally
stumbles
over
lines
he
has
repeated
dozens
of
times
the
other
night
he
referred
to
his
running
mate
as
baracko
just
as
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
of
new
york
did
in
the
primaries
palin
dismisses
obamas
oratory
as
just
words
even
as
she
whips
crowds
into
a
frenzy
with
her
own
remarks
the
rousing
speeches
of
our
opponent
they
can
fill
a
stadium
palin
said
but
they
cannot
keep
our
country
safe
and
for
a
season
a
man
can
inspire
with
his
words
but
for
a
lifetime
john
mccain
has
inspired
us
with
his
deeds
her
speeches
have
relied
on
repetition
especially
words
like
tough
and
guts
when
applied
to
mccain
speaking
in
virginia
on
saturday
night
palin
repeated
the
phrase
joe
the
plumber
six
times
palin
singles
out
biden
regularly
in
her
remarks
noting
that
he
once
said
it
would
be
patriotic
for
the
wealthy
to
pay
more
taxes
and
recalling
that
in
a
verbal
slip
biden
said
that
he
and
obama
opposed
socalled
clean
coal
technology
but
biden
rarely
singles
out
anything
palin
has
said
or
done
he
does
not
question
her
qualifications
or
mention
any
of
her
verbal
blunders
she
appears
if
at
all
as
mccainpalin
merely
an
appendage
to
the
republican
nominee
for
president
on
monday
palin
will
begin
her
day
in
ohio
and
then
head
to
missouri
iowa
colorado
and
nevada
late
that
night
she
will
fly
to
anchorage
travel
to
her
home
in
wasilla
alaska
to
cast
her
vote
and
then
fly
to
phoenix
to
join
mccain
biden
will
start
monday
with
a
speech
in
lees
summit
mo
then
appear
in
zanesville
and
akron
ohio
before
ending
his
day
with
a
rally
in
philadelphia
he
will
vote
in
his
hometown
of
wilmington
del
then
fly
to
chicago
to
spend
election
night
with
obama
at
a
large
gathering
in
grant
park
sandy
hammargren
is
the
definition
of
a
patient
longsuffering
wife
except
when
it
comes
to
big
bertha
her
husband
dr
lonnie
hammargren
built
big
bertha
a
black
10foottall
model
locomotive
in
their
backyard
from
a
disparate
collection
of
parts
a
rail
car
believed
to
have
brought
howard
hughes
to
las
vegas
part
of
a
road
girder
a
piece
of
an
1890
steam
tractor
a
boiler
from
something
entirely
different
i
cant
remember
what
hammargren
said
the
wheels
were
from
castoff
parts
of
old
cat
scan
machines
oh
i
just
hate
it
she
said
its
awful
to
look
at
that
she
wants
big
bertha
gone
is
not
surprising
what
is
astonishing
is
that
big
bertha
is
all
that
earns
her
wrath
when
nearly
every
inch
of
her
vast
home
is
overwhelmed
by
thousands
of
other
bits
of
memorabilia
collections
bizarre
shop
projects
and
unadulterated
junk
the
endless
displays
which
leave
nary
an
inch
of
floor
space
inside
or
outside
their
home
in
southeast
las
vegas
add
up
to
a
lifetime
of
acquisitions
for
hammargren
a
former
twoterm
nevada
lieutenant
governor
and
retired
neurosurgeon
hammargren
opened
the
home
to
the
public
on
sunday
afternoon
as
he
does
each
year
to
observe
the
anniversary
of
nevada
statehood
once
a
stately
onestory
house
it
has
three
floors
and
is
attached
to
homes
on
each
side
that
hammargren
bought
over
the
years
and
loaded
with
his
evermultiplying
collections
the
contents
range
wildly
and
appear
to
have
little
organization
a
lifesize
doll
of
the
late
entertainer
sammy
davis
jr
sits
as
the
conductor
of
a
train
that
came
from
the
nevada
test
site
nuclear
proving
ground
hammargren
is
predominantly
occupied
by
items
from
old
vegas
casinos
scale
models
of
famous
sites
from
around
the
globe
and
various
nasa
space
missions
hammargren
70
was
a
nasa
flight
surgeon
who
flew
in
jets
with
the
likes
of
the
astronaut
buzz
aldrin
a
friend
and
occasional
visitor
the
home
goes
by
at
least
three
names

the
castillo
del
sol
the
hammargren
home
of
nevada
history
and
the
principality
of
paradise
hammargren
calls
his
stead
a
country
of
its
own
and
gives
visitors
faux
gold
coins
with
his
face
on
them
trying
to
converse
with
hammargren
is
a
challenge
because
like
the
disparate
items
crammed
into
his
home
his
soliloquies
move
without
pause
or
logical
transition
from
one
world
to
another
my
hobbies
are
astronomy
and
archeology
put
it
together
thats
archostronomy
which
is
really
the
history
of
the
world
through
stars
but
oh
theres
the
large
pink
egg
that
liberace
used
to
come
out
of
every
easter
during
his
easter
show
he
said
and
over
there
thats
my
saddam
husseinosama
bin
laden
display
which
i
call
the
wacky
iraqi
half
tacky
as
a
political
figure
hammargren
a
republican
was
never
taken
all
that
seriously
his
quirky
persona
helped
him
win
election
in
1990
and
1994
as
the
states
lieutenant
governor
an
office
with
virtually
no
duty
other
than
to
ascend
in
the
event
of
the
governors
death
or
removal
but
hammargren
did
not
seem
to
see
the
office
that
way
he
startled
the
political
establishment
when
as
acting
governor
when
gov
bob
miller
a
democrat
was
momentarily
out
of
the
state
he
tried
to
appoint
someone
to
fill
a
vacancy
on
the
lincoln
county
commission
the
secretary
of
state
also
a
republican
refused
to
notarize
the
appointment
hammargren
ran
for
governor
in
2000
but
did
not
earn
his
partys
nomination
he
is
well
regarded
as
a
physician
when
he
arrived
in
nevada
in
1971
he
was
one
of
only
two
neurosurgeons
in
the
state
and
has
operated
on
thousands
of
people
since
among
his
most
notable
patients
was
roy
horn
of
the
illusionist
duo
siegfried
ampamp
roy
who
was
attacked
on
stage
by
a
tiger
in
2003
yet
that
too
got
hammargren
into
some
trouble
when
he
disclosed
to
reporters
details
of
the
surgery
on
sunday
as
a
crowd
wended
through
the
home
many
took
in
the
scenery
with
a
mixture
of
bemusement
repulsion
and
indeed
a
little
fear
oh
god
whats
going
to
be
in
the
next
room
asked
darren
damato
44
of
henderson
who
decided
to
visit
after
hearing
a
local
radio
host
say
on
friday
that
the
open
house
was
a
rite
of
passage
for
nevadans
this
place
is
a
beautiful
monstrosity
thats
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
damato
wondered
how
the
neighbors
cope
many
grouse
to
the
news
media
anonymously
about
the
clutter
and
clatter
and
about
concerns
that
such
an
eyesore
damages
home
values
in
a
subdivision
of
halfacre
lots
with
neat
lawns
and
tasteful
facades
by
contrast
the
principality
of
paradises
facade
is
a
huge
homemade
fiberglass
replica
of
a
mayan
temple
the
hammargrens
have
skirmished
with
neighbors
who
have
complained
to
local
authorities
but
the
doctor
has
never
been
forced
to
limit
or
alter
his
home
thousands
come
to
see
the
place
when
it
is
open
for
visitors
but
it
has
also
topped
local
newspaper
readers
polls
as
the
citys
biggest
eyesore
yet
dotty
reeve
who
weeded
her
yard
across
the
street
on
saturday
said
she
enjoyed
her
proximity
its
kind
of
fun
to
tell
you
the
truth
reeve
said
not
many
people
like
it
but
its
not
hurting
anybody
its
kind
of
interesting
really
i
think
people
gripe
about
it
but
the
same
people
drive
by
just
to
see
whats
going
on
there
thousands
of
russians
from
the
prokremlin
youth
group
nashi
gathered
in
front
of
the
united
states
embassy
here
on
sunday
night
carrying
jackolanterns
inked
with
the
names
of
war
victims
and
charging
that
the
war
in
georgia
was
part
of
an
american
plot
to
improve
sen
john
mccains
electoral
prospects
as
music
by
johnny
cash
and
the
allman
brothers
played
from
loudspeakers
a
stream
of
young
people
climbed
off
buses
that
had
carried
them
to
moscow
from
farflung
provincial
capitals
they
held
the
pumpkins
aloft
for
a
moment
of
silence
as
a
deep
bass
thumped
and
carnivalstyle
lights
played
on
the
embassys
facade
in
a
film
projected
on
several
large
screens
an
actor
playing
president
bush
though
with
a
heavy
russian
accent
delivered
a
speech
in
which
he
gloated
over
the
united
states
control
over
world
affairs
the
film
asserted
that
the
united
states
orchestrated
world
wars
i
and
ii
so
that
the
american
economy
could
overtake
europes
carried
out
the
sept
11
attacks
to
broaden
government
powers
and
planned
to
brand
every
person
on
the
planet
with
the
mark
of
the
beast
as
referenced
in
the
bible
when
that
will
happen
we
will
totally
control
all
humanity
said
the
actor
playing
bush
swigging
a
beer
as
a
picture
of
the
globe
in
chains
glowed
behind
him
the
opinions
in
the
crowd
were
far
more
nuanced
most
of
the
demonstrators
men
and
women
in
their
teens
and
early
20s
said
they
held
the
united
states
responsible
for
the
war
in
georgia
saying
president
mikheil
saakashvili
of
georgia
would
not
have
attacked
the
separatist
enclave
of
south
ossetia
without
express
permission
from
american
officials
several
demonstrators
said
they
had
become
disillusioned
with
the
united
states
during
the
1990s
saying
the
reforms
it
pushed
had
led
russia
into
financial
and
political
chaos
we
dont
like
to
be
told
how
to
live
and
we
dont
like
it
when
our
peacekeepers
are
attacked
said
yura
yakor
23
youre
not
likely
to
find
any
fans
of
america
here
as
they
shivered
in
the
wintry
rain
nearly
everyone
had
something
to
say
about
the
coming
us
elections
many
agreed
with
the
theory
espoused
by
prime
minister
vladimir
v
putin
in
a
televised
interview
this
fall
that
the
war
in
georgia
was
planned
to
increase
the
chances
of
mccain
the
republican
presidential
candidate
a
few
said
they
thought
a
victory
for
sen
barack
obama
would
greatly
improve
relations
between
the
united
states
and
russia
if
mccain
wins
i
think
everything
will
get
worse
said
yekaterina
anisimova
20
who
had
traveled
from
vladimir
about
125
miles
east
of
moscow
for
the
rally
he
is
categorically
against
russia
obama
is
the
opposite
all
this
could
end
her
friend
yana
vinogradova
agreed
we
dont
hate
america
she
said
we
just
have
a
bad
relationship
with
this
administration
as
the
american
reporter
departed
anisimova

after
her
vote
for
obama
gov
sarah
palin
of

was
swiftly
working
the
rope
line
friday
at
an
apple
orchard
in
southwestern
pennsylvania
when
she
met
a
supporter
who
brought
her
to
an
abrupt
stop
amber

held
a
poster
that
read
i
have

im
a

seeing
brown
palin
wrapped
her
in
a
tight
hug
i
love
that
poster
palin
said
youre
a
fighter
and
youre
beautiful
then
palin
hugged
her
again
before
climbing
back
on
her
campaign
bus
she
circled
back
to
brown
and
hugged
her
a
third
time
palin
the
republican
vicepresidential
nominee
continues
to
attract
enthusiastic
crowds
wherever
she
travels
and
invariably
among
her
supporters
are
those
drawn
by
her
advocacy
for
children
with
special
needs
palin
44
is
herself
the
mother
of
a
child
with
down
syndrome
6monthold
trig
who
frequently
travels
with
her
within
minutes
after
boarding
her
campaign
plane
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
palin
can
often
be
seen
leaning
over
trig
cooing
and
feeding
him
from
a
bottle
he
is
usually
brought
on
stage
with
the
rest
of
the
palin
family
held
by
willow
or
piper
two
of
palins
daughters
on
halloween
trig
went
trickortreating
with
the
palin
entourage
dressed
as
a
baby
elephant
in
the
two
months
since
she
was
named
as
sen
john
mccains
running
mate
palin
has
made
trig
and
children
like
him
the
emotional
center
of
her
campaign
and
families
have
turned
out
at
every
stop
carrying
signs
wearing
tshirts
and
pressing
to
the
front
of
the
rope
lines
for
a
hug
or
a
photo
with
a
candidate
many
of
them
see
as
a
potential
first
friend
in
the
white
house
someone
poised
to
bring
better
schooling
more
medicaid
financing
and
greater
attention
to
their
cause
palins
first
policy
speech
as
a
vicepresidential
nominee
addressed
school
financing
for
specialneeds
children
she
promised
that
under
a
mccainpalin
administration
disabled
students
would
have
the
option
of
attending
private
schools
at
public
expense
as
governor
of
alaska
palin
increased
funding
for
specialneeds
students
signing
a
bill
that
promised
to
triple
perpupil
spending
over
three
years
for
those
students
whose
educations
cost
more
but
beyond
policy
the
families
say
they
see
in
palin
someone
who
understands
their
struggles

who
gets
it
as
palin
might
say

and
connects
with
them
in
a
personal
way
after
giving
that
policy
address
on
oct
24
in
a
hotel
meeting
room
before
about
150
parents
and
children
with
special
needs
palin
was
leaving
the
room
when
one
of
the
babies
was
heard
crying
dont
worry
one
bit
about
any
crying
baby
palin
said
thats
the
sound
of
life
i
love
it
thats
good
i
say
that
too
because
the
next
one
crying
could
be
my
son
palins
mention
of
the
subject
is
the
emotional
high
point
of
her
stump
speech
a
late
moment
when
she
talks
about
what
she
would
do
as
vice
president
and
mentions
a
mission
that
is
especially
close
to
my
heart
speaking
to
more
than
8000
people
last
week
in
jeffersonville
ind
palin
had
just
begun
to
mention
children
with
special
needs
when
she
was
interrupted
by
a
shout
we
love
you
sarah
she
continued
saying
they
have
been
excluded
and
been
made
to
feel
that
there
is
no
place
for
them
in
the
life
of
our
country
and
this
attitude
is
a
grave
disservice
to
these
beautiful
children
and
to
their
families
and
to
america
and
im
going
to
work
to
change
that
the
crowd
erupted
in
cheers
ignoring
her
teleprompter
palin
gazed
to
her
left
ive
got
to
make
a
comment
about
this
poster
she
said

i
love
that
shes
an
advocate
for
special
needs
it
hasnt
been
since
the
kennedys
that
weve
heard
a
politician
talk
about
it
and
they
talked
about
it
in
a
very
different
way
and
that
was
so
long
ago
many
of
the
families
who
come
to
palins
events
would
support
the
republican
ticket
even
if
palin
did
not
speak
for
their
interests
like
her
many
oppose
abortion
and
share
her
conservative
positions
perry
and
beth
heslop
of
marietta
ohio
are
among
them
they
attended
a
rally
in
ohio
on
sunday
afternoon
with
their
5yearold
son
tucker
who
played
quietly
on
the
floor
they
said
they
were
also
attracted
by
palins
position
on
the
second
amendment
and
her
christian
faith
and
as
parents
of
a
specialneeds
child
we
admire
her
for
keeping
her
baby
even
though
she
knew
he
had
down
syndrome
perry
heslop
said
heslop
said
tucker
was
born
without
intestines
a
condition
they
did
not
know
about
until
he
was
born
taking
care
of
him
they
said
presents
a
host
of
challenges
he
cannot
eat
so
it
is
difficult
to
find
a
qualified
caretaker
the
county
government
provides
a
parttime
nurse
and
their
church
helps
with
gas
costs
but
heslop
was
just
notified
that
his
office
the
forestry
division
of
the
ohio
department
of
natural
resources
will
soon
be
closed
and
he
will
lose
his
health
insurance
at
the
end
of
the
year
without
insurance
the
cost
of
tuckers
care
will
be
overwhelming
were
counting
on
god
to
help
us
heslop
said
palin
he
said
knows
the

tolleson

may
be
the
worlds

addict
in
recent
weeks
the
chairman
of
viacom
and
cbs
has
been
forced
to
sell
more
than
200
million
of
stock
in
his
companies
after
a
margin
call
from
lenders
and
there
has
been
fervent
speculation
that
he
could
lose
his
grip
on
one
of
the
worlds
great
media
empires
like
other
top
executives
he
was
ensnared
by
the
financial
crisis
and
the
whipsawing
stock
market
which
drove
down
the
price
of
stock
in
viacom
and
cbs
to
a
level
that
breached
his
lending
agreements
with
banks

forcing
him
to
make
the
big
stock
sale
but
at
least
some
of
redstones
mounting
problems
can
be
traced
to
a
25year
bad
bet
he
made
on
the
video
game
maker
midway
games
which
has
cost
him
hundreds
of
millions
of

redstone
has
always
argued

not
incorrectly

that
video
games
are
part
of
the
media
industrys
future
but
midway
which
is
best
known
for
the
1990s

eaten
up

has
been
forced
to
support
the
company
with
loans
this
year
it
extended
some
90
million
to

to
keep
it
afloat
redstone
has
publicly
insisted
that
he
would
not
sell
more
stock
in
cbs
and
viacom
to
cover
his
personal
debts
but
he
is
considering
selling
a

in

the
family
holding
company
that
is
redstones
vehicle
for
controlling
viacom
and
cbs
according
to
an
executive
briefed
on
the
matter
who
spoke
anonymously
because
the
negotiations
were
meant
to
be
confidential
this
was
only
the
latest
installment
of
the
topsyturvy
ride
that
has
been
redstones
life
over
the
last
decade

a
span
that
has
included
a
messy
first
divorce
a
long
and
public
falling
out
with
his
daughter
a
lawsuit
over
money
with
his
son
and
the
torpedoing
of
relationships
with
his
minions
and
with
tom
cruise
in
the
middle
of
this
latest
episode
he
also
filed
for
divorce
from
his
second
wife
its
typical
hollywood
soap
opera
said
anthony
diclemente
a
media
analyst
at
barclays
capital
who
covers
viacom
and
cbs
its
why
you
cover
this
industry
but
beyond
the
personality
of
redstone
himself
who
often
jokes
that
he
plans
to
live
forever
the
breach
in
his
lending
agreements
with
the
banks
illustrates
how
the
opaque
structure
at
his
familys
holding
company
left
wall
street
and
even
company
executives
in
the
dark
about
his
financial
troubles
national
amusements
is
a
private
company
with
a
controlling
interest
in
cbs
and
viacom
and
is
governed
by
a
board
that
includes
redstone
his
daughter
shari
and
three
lawyers
that
have
long
been
close
to
redstone

including
philippe
p
dauman
who
is
also
chief
executive
of
viacom
that
much
has
always
been
clear
what
investors
and
analysts
did
not
know
was
the
link
between
redstones
debt
load
and
the
share
prices
of
cbs
and
viacom

and
the
possibility
that
a
margin
call
could
force
a
large
stock
sale
on
oct
10
redstone
surprised
his
own
executives
when
he
was
forced
to
sell
233
million
in
nonvoting
stock
in
cbs
and
viacom
because
he
had
breached
his
covenants
on
16
billion
in
loans
at
national
amusements
in
a
matter
of
hours
lawyers
at
cbs
and
viacom
were
forced
to
release
updated
financial
guidance
which
warned
that
a
deteriorating
advertising
market
would
hit
both
companies
bottom
lines
the
updated
guidance
was
to
comply
with
securities
laws
that
restrict
insider
stock
sales
in
the
weeks
before
earnings
are
released
that
redstone
had
so
much
debt
and
that
the
debt
was
tied
to
the
value
of
viacom
and
cbs
was
a
surprise
to
analysts
some
of
whom
raised
the
question
of
whether
it
should
have
been
disclosed
earlier
diclemente
the
barclays
analyst
said
this
is
the
risk
you
take
when
you
invest
in
a
company
with
a
big
majority
shareholder
you
dont
know
what
the
personal
balance
sheets
are
of
these
guys
through
a
spokesman
redstone
declined
to
be
interviewed
but
viacom
reports
earnings
on
monday
and
redstone
will
join
the
conference
call
with
wall
street
analysts
redstones
wealth
and
identity
are
linked
with
cbs
and
viacom
but
his
relationship
with
midway
stretches
back
further
in
1983
he
began
buying
shares
in
wms
industries
midways
predecessor
and
has
been
a
shareholder
in
the
company
ever
since

a
relationship
that
even
helped
him
settle
his
first
divorce
which
was
filed
in
1999
and
settled
in
2002
midway
was
spun
off
from
wms
industries
a
slot
machine
maker
in
1996
as
a
separate
public
company
and
sometime
after
that
redstone
is
said
to
have
decided
that
video
games
would
become
an
important
part
of
the
media
business
i
think
that
he
believed
in
the
industry
so
much
so
that
any
company
that
was
solvent
that
was
in
the
business
had
potential
said
pachter
who
has
long
followed
midway
in
late
2005
the
stake
held
by
redstone
who
owns
about
80
million
shares
through
various
entities
or
87
percent
of
the
company
was
valued
at
more
than
18
billion
last
week
when
shares
in
midway
traded
at
about
80
cents
apiece
his
stake
had
a
value
of
just
64
million
despite
this
in
march
redstone
appeared
at
a
media
conference
in
florida
hosted
by
bear
stearns
and
expressed
optimism
about
midway
saying
he
is
committed
to
midway
we
just
gave
midway
90
million
well
do
everything
to
keep
it
going
for
all
his
billions

dwindling
they
now
may
be

it
was
stock
in
midway
that
redstone
used
to
pay
for
his
divorce
settlement
with
his
first
wife
phyllis
in
2002
after
doling
out
a
big
chunk
of
midway
stock
redstone
proceeded
to
replenish
his
portfolio
until
late
2005
when
he
reached
about
80
million
shares
his
stake
is
roughly
equal
to
that
today
meanwhile
redstone
has
shuffled
the
shares
in
midway
among
himself
national
amusements
and
a
third
company
he
created
called
sumco
in
2005
he
transferred
33
million
shares
in
midway
to
national
amusements
in
exchange
for
national
assuming
responsibility
for
a
425
million
loan
redstone
had
with
citigroup
as
part
of
this
deal
redstones
daughter
shari
e
redstone
effectively
gained
control
of
the
midway
stock
today
shari
redstone
who
sits
on
the
boards
of
both
viacom
and
cbs
is
also
the
chairman
of
midway
redstone
and
his
daughter
have
engaged
in
a
public
feud
for
more
than
a
year
over
control
of
the
family
business
at
one
point
the
two
sides
were
near
a
deal
in
which
shari
redstone
would
trade
her
stake
in
cbs
and
viacom
for
complete
ownership
of
the
familys
movie
theater
business
but
those
talks
have
halted
because
of
the
present
financial
troubles
at
national
amusements
at
the
same
time
a
committee
of
two
lawyers
from
boston
redstones
hometown
that
have
long
been
by
his
side
and
his
daughter
are
negotiating
with
a
consortium
of
banks
to
restructure
some
16
billion
in
debt
at
national
amusements
as
part
of
those
discussions
several
options
for
raising
cash
are
under
consideration

including
selling
a
minority
stake
in
national
amusements
selling
pieces
of
the
familys
movie
theater
chain
business
or
selling
stakes
in
wms
industries
and
midway
meanwhile
shares
in
both
cbs
and
viacom
have
tumbled
both
have
suffered
from
the
general
malaise
in
the
stock
market
and
fundamental
shifts
in
the
media
industry
last
week
cbs
reported
a
126
billion
quarterly
loss
mainly
because
of
a
1412
billion
writedown
of
certain
assets
redstone
remains
optimistic
however
he
once
mostly
lived
out
of
fancy
hotels
but
now
spends
much
of
his
time
in
his
gated
mansion
in
beverly
park
calif
surrounded
by
tanks
of
exotic
fish
and
tended
to
by
his
butler
it
was
from
this
perch
that
he
joined
a
conference
call
last
week
to
discuss
cbss
quarterly
earnings
and
said
he
did
not
plan
to
sell
any
more
shares
in
cbs
or
viacom
let
me
make
it
sure
clear
certain
redstone
said
national
amusements
has
no
intention
of
selling
a
single
share
of
viacom
or
cbs
now
there
may
be
uncertainties
all
around
us
but
one
of
the
things
i
remain
absolutely
certain
of
whatever
actions
are
required
in
no
way
diminishes
my
optimism
of
our
cbs
and
viacom
millions
of
voters
will
encounter
an
unfamiliar
lowtech
landscape
at
the
polls
on
tuesday
about
half
of
all
voters
will
vote
in
a
way
that
is
different
from
what
they
did
in
the
last
presidential
election
and
most
will
use
paper
ballots
rather
than
the
touchscreen
machines
that
have
caused
concern
among
voting
experts
but
the
change
does
not
guarantee
a
smooth
election
day
as
the
nations
voting
system
remains
untested
for
what
is
expected
to
be
an
unprecedented
turnout
six
years
after
the
largest
federal
overhaul
in
how
elections
are
run
voting
experts
are
still
predicting
machine
and
ballot
shortages
in
several
swing
states
and
late
tallies
on
election
night
twothirds
of
voters
will
mark
their
choice
with
a
pencil
on
a
paper
ballot
that
is
counted
by
an
optical
scanning
machine
a
method
considered
far
more
reliable
and
verifiable
than
touch
screens
but
paper
ballots
bring
their
own
potential
problems
voting
experts
say
the
scanners
can
break
down
leading
to
delays
and
confusion
for
poll
workers
and
voters
and
the
paper
ballots
of
about
a
third
of
all
voters
will
be
counted
not
at
the
polling
place
but
later
at
a
central
county
location
that
means
that
if
a
voter
has
made
an
error

not
filling
in
an
oval
properly
for
example
a
mistake
often
made
by
the
kind
of
novice
voters
who
will
be
flocking
to
the
polls

it
will
not
be
caught
until
it
is
too
late
as
a
result
those
ballots
will
be
disqualified
voting
rights
groups
have
also
filed
lawsuits
against
election
officials
in
pennsylvania
and
virginia
saying
they
have
not
stocked
enough
paper
ballots
to
prepare
for
the
expected
turnout
most
voting
experts
are
not
predicting
a
repeat
of
the
florida
meltdown
of
2000
but
they
are
warning
that
shortages
of
electronic
voting
machines
or
printed
ballots
in
swing
states
along
with
problems
verifying
the
identity
of
voters
could
worsen
lines
and
fray
nerves
what
has
traditionally
happened
in
this
country
is
that
a
change
in
voting
equipment
happens
once
in
the
lifetime
of
an
election
official
said
kimball
w
brace
president
of
election
data
services
a
voting
research
firm
this
time
nearly
60
percent
of
the
country
will
vote
in
places
that
in
the
last
eight
years
have
changed
their
voting
equipment
the
vicepresidential
candidates
spent
the
final
frenetic
hours
of
the
2008
campaign
on
traditionally
republican
turf
with
sen
joseph
r
biden
jr
urging
democrats
to
get
to
the
polls
and
gov
sarah
palin
warning
that
the
farleft
wing
of
the
democrat
party
is
poised
to
take
over
washington
palin
addressed
large
crowds
in
florida
north
carolina
and
virginia
on
saturday
and
made
several
appearances
in
ohio
on
sunday
biden
spent
saturday
and
sunday
skittering
around
ohio
and
florida
before
heading
to
missouri
for
an
early
appearance
on
monday
it
is
no
coincidence
that
the
candidates
are
appearing
only
in
states
that
president
bush
won
in
2004
palins
message
at
its
heart
is
a
fearbased
argument
against
electing
sen
barack
obama
of
illinois
she
warns
voters
that
obama
will
raise
taxes
expand
government
capitulate
to
terrorists
and
promote
an
extreme
liberal
agenda
with
the
help
of
broader
democratic
majorities
in
congress
the
time
for
choosing
is
near
and
the
choice
is
going
to
come
down
to
what
we
believe
in
ohio
palin
said
at
a
rally
sunday
in
canton
ohio
we
believe
in
the
forward
movement
of
freedom
not
the
constant
expansion
of
government
bidens
message
has
evolved
in
recent
days
from
harsh
attacks
on
mccain
and
palin
to
a
broader
appeal
for
an
end
to
what
he
calls
the
politics
of
division
he
still
mocks
the
republican
ticket
arguing
that
they
are
not
mavericks
but
rather
mere
sidekicks
to
bush
who
would
continue
his
foreign
and
economic
policies
he
says
that
in
their
desperation
mccain
and
palin
are
using
smears
and
lies
to
impugn
obamas
character
and
patriotism
but
biden
with
an
unstated
sense
that
victory
is

turned
to
a
call
for
healing
a
divided
nation
he
urges
his
audiences
to
choose
hope
over
fear
biden
and
palin
have
accelerated
their
schedules
now
appearing
at
as
many
as
five
rallies
a
day
in
as
many
cities
their
exhaustion
is
beginning
to
show
particularly
late
at
night
palins
voice
sometimes
grows
hoarse
and
biden
occasionally
stumbles
over
lines
he
has
repeated
dozens
of
times
on
monday
palin
will
begin
her
day
in
ohio
and
then
head
to
missouri
iowa
colorado
and

late
that

she
will
fly

biden
will
start
monday
with

then
appear
in

with
a

in

hometown
of
wilmington
del
then
fly
to
chicago
to
spend
election
night
with
obama
at
a
large
gathering
in
grant
park
when
did
cbs
the
network
awash
in
cop
shows
featuring
leading
men
in
their
50s
become
the
hot
network
with
young
audiences
this
is
how
topsyturvy
the
fall
television
season
has
become
five
weeks
in
cbs
has
twice
as
many
shows
in
the
top
20
ranking
among
young
adult
viewers
as
any
of
its
network
competitors
cbs
is
supposed
to
be
the
network
that
does
not
fixate
on
the
18
to
49yearold
demographic
which
many
advertisers
pay
a
premium
to
reach
but
the
network
has
been
beating
abc
nbc
and
fox
in
that
ratings
competition
every
week
this
fall
of
course
cbs
has
also
been
winning
in
the
somewhat
older
group
25to54year
olds
just
as
it
has
been
attracting
the
most
viewers
over
all
this
has
not
occurred
since
the
antediluvian
days
before
the
installation
of
socalled
people
meter
ratings
system
in
1987
the
secret
at
least
as
the
chairman
of
cbs
leslie
moonves
sees
it
comfort
food
while
other
networks
sit
and
watch
their
glossy
serial
dramas
featuring
expensive
casts
crash
cbs
has
added
yet
another
successful
crime
show
the
mentalist
it
has
also
added
a
couple
more
funny
comedies
that
probably
wont
win
any
emmy
awards
as
moonves
described
them
gary
unmarried
and
worst
week
apparently
what
is
good
for
cbs
is
a
bad
economy
cbss
lineup
of
police
procedurals
where
the
criminals
always
get
caught
and
sitcoms
that
are
reliably
funny
in
unchallenging
ways
seems
to
be
becoming
a
safe
haven
for
viewers
worried
about
jobs
and
mortgages
when
the
road
gets
rocky
the
center
is
the
best
place
to
be
said
kelly
kahl
the
chief
scheduler
for
cbs
its
kind
of
a
cliche
moonves
said
on
cbs
the
good
guys
win
or
as
kahl
put
it
we
give
people
what
they
want
the
news
is
not
all
kind
to
cbs
many
executives
are
concerned
that
the
advertising
market
will
freeze
up
because
of
the
economy
last
week
cbs
was
forced
to
take
a
writedown
of
14
billion
because
the
advertising
market
for
its
local
television
radio
and
outdoor
businesses
is
so
bad
we
have
a
lot
of
advertising
and
people
are
down
on
advertising
right
now
moonves
said
and
it
is
not
as
if
cbs
has
found
a
magic
potion
its
move
to
first
place
is
mostly
attributable
to
standing
still
while
others
slide
down
cbs
is
not
actually
up
in
the
ratings
it
is
down
marginally
about
3
percent
but
its
competitors
are
down
near
15
percent
each
all
of
these
measures
are
based
on
the
traditional
ratings
system
that
ratings
system
itself
is
in
the
midst
of
upheaval
because
of
the
increasing
use
of
digital
video
recorders
which
allow
for
delayed
viewing
and
the
shift
by
advertisers
toward
buying
shows
on
how
well
their
commercials
are
rated
after
three
days
of
viewing

the
socalled
c3
measurement
abc
which
has
taken
serious
hits
almost
across
the
board
in
terms
of
traditional
program
ratings
points
to
those
c3
ratings
as
some
solace
by
the
most
important
yardstick
based
on
the
sales
currency
of
c3
ratings
were
the
network
leader
stephen
mcpherson
the
president
of
abc
entertainment
said
in
an
email
message
that
may
prove
helpful
if
abc
can
keep
it
up
the
c3
numbers
are
so
far
available
only
through
two
weeks
network
executives
point
to
a
raft
of
reasons
why
this
season
has
been
so
rocky
starting
with
last
seasons
writers
strike
but
other
factors
have
intruded
this
fall
the
economy
and
the
election
are
the
two
most
important
shows
in
america
right
now
said
ben
silverman
the
cochairman
of
nbc
entertainment
the
faltering
economy
is
threatening
the
advertising
that
pays
for
most
television
shows
the
election
has
proved
a
powerful
attraction
silverman
said
people
arent
watching
network
shows
as
much
but
the
cable
news
networks
are
setting
records
he
said
and
he
said
that
the
four
debates
this
fall
coming
on
separate
nights
of
the
week
disrupted
every
networks
schedule
the
most
important
move
cbs
made
moonves
said
was
to
get
the
networks
series
back
on
the
air
last
spring
after
the
strike
ended
while
other
networks
let
shows
lapse
in
production
both
abc
and
nbc
had
a
group
of
firstyear
shows
that
were
truncated
by
the
strike
abcs
entire
wednesday
night
schedule
consisted
of
firstyear
shows
that
it
suspended
after
the
strike
and
then
brought
back
this
fall
the
ratings
have
plummeted
for
those
shows
pushing
daisies
dirty
sexy
money
and
private
practice
other
serialized
shows
like
the
nbc
drama
heroes
and
even
abcs
biggest
hits
greys
anatomy
and
desperate
housewives
have
performed
well
below
their
levels
of
a
year
ago
that
has
led
to
some
speculation
that
the
networks
may
move
away
from
serialized
shows
in
the
dvr
era
both
because
viewers
may
increasingly
store
episodes
of
serialized
shows
to
watch
them
in
8to10
episode
bursts
and
because
the
shows
have
no
repeat
value
at
all
at
least
one
network
other
than
cbs
is
starting
to
conclude
the
same
thing
about
program
trends
this
fall
were
trying
to
build
a
spine
of
shows
we
can
rely
on
said
kevin
reilly
the
president
of
fox
entertainment
among
them
the
emerging
hit
bones
a
crime
drama
that
solves
its
cases
every
week
and
repeats
relatively
well
while
its
fall
numbers
are
down
no
one
doubts
foxs
overall
strength
not
with
american
idol
ready
to
come
back
along
with
the
drama
24
reilly
may
be
putting
some
extra
fear
in
his
rivals
by
floating
the
idea
that
fox
may
do
something
different
with
idol
this
time
around

as
in
move
one
of
two
weekly
editions
to
a
regular
slot
on
thursday
nights
the
most
lucrative
night
for
advertising
thats
where
the
other
three
networks
have
arrayed
many
of
their
biggest
shows
and
idol
has
not
ventured
there
before
now
reilly
said
well
certainly
explore
it
meanwhile
foxs
biggest
hit
drama
house
has
been
at
the
center
of
one
of
the
better
strategic
moves
of
the
season
fox
slid
the
show
to
8
pm
from
9
pm
on
tuesdays
this
fall
knowing
as
reilly
put
it
that
we
would
take
a
haircut
in
ratings
for
house
because
viewing
levels
are
lower
at
8
pm
the
move
intended
to
feed
a
big
audience
into
the
new
drama
fringe
has
paid
off
the
show
is
the
second
true
success
story
of
the
fall
along
with
the
mentalist
silverman
and
nbc
made
another
big
strategic
move
in
slotting
three
weeks
of
special
electionbased
saturday
night
live
editions
at
930
thursdays
after
the
hit
comedy
the
office
the
plan
was
to
prepare
the
time
period
for
the
lowrated
but
promising
comedy
30
rock
the
network
got
a
big
break
with
tina
feys
celebrated
impersonation
of
the
republican
vice
presidential
candidate
sarah
palin
on
the
snl
specials
the
following
she
built
finally
seemed
to
carry
over
into
the
strongest
ratings
ever
for
the
30
rock
premiere
last
thursday
the
urgent
need
to
rebuild
comedy

which
has
been
in
reverse
for
most
of
this
decade

may
be
the
most
significant
message
of
the
early
season
silverman
said
he
intended
to
use
a
strategy
of
patience
with
nbcs
new
comedy
kath
and
kim
which
some
critics
and
rivals
have
already
written
off
its
ratings
are
hardly
special
but
they
have
stabilized
silverman
said
weve
got
great
actors
and
notgreat
writing
lets
fix
it
he
said
for
the
last
eight
months
adam
aignertreworgys
belongings
have
been
stowed
in
the
back
seat
of
his
silver
volvo
station
wagon
when
aignertreworgy
a
24yearold
reporter
for
nbc
news
and
national
journal
was
assigned
to
cover
sen
john
mccains
campaign
in
january
his
sister
packed
up
his
apartment
in
washington
dc
i
sold
as
much
furniture
as
i
could
on
craigslist
he
said
then
parked
his
car
at
the
nbc
bureau
and
flew
to
florida
to
catch
up
with
the
mccain
campaign
on
a
rare
free
day
in
the
spring
he
drove
the
car
then
lacking
airconditioning
and
a
working
gas
gauge
to
his
mothers
garage
in
boston
where
it
remains
this
month
he
will
resume
an
ordinary
life

and
that
means
finding
a
job
in
an
economy
that
is
gloomy
across
the
board
but
especially
so
for
journalists
the
field
of
journalism
is
changing
dramatically
so
theres
definitely
some
trepidation
about
whether
companies
will
be
hiring
he
said
by
phone
on
friday
as
politicians
enter
the
presidential
primary
fray
television
networks
assign
staff
members

variously
called
campaign
embeds
or
offair
reporters

to
shadow
them
video
camera
in
hand
and
laptop
in
backpack
after
each
campaign
event
the
embeds
dutifully
send
summaries
to
their
news
divisions
flagging
any
newsmaking
nuggets
the
dispatches
are
often
posted
online
and
used
to
produce
newscasts
the
from
the
road
blog
on
cbsnewscom
counted
9
posts
from
campaign
producers
on
thursday
and
10
on
friday
as
financially
struggling
newspapers
cut
back
on
their
coverage
from
the
campaign
trail
the
tv
embeds
and
their
counterparts
from
national
newspapers
have
become
the
primary
witnesses
to
the
campaigns
of
mccain
and
his
democratic
opponent
sen
barack
obama
and
while
the
experience
is
invaluable
the
opportunities
are
few
after
the
election
for
so
long
this
has
been
in
the
distance
now
its
real
now
its
here
said
alexander
marquardt
a
cnn
producer
following
sen
joseph
r
biden
jr
there
is
a
certain
nobility
subtle
as
it
may
be
to
chronicling
the
statements
of
the
candidates
as
they
roam
the
country
you
become
the
central
repository
for
information
about
a
candidate
for
a
big
news
network
aignertreworgy
said
sunlen
miller
an
abc
reporter
assigned
to
obamas
campaign
answers
practical
questions
from
the
networks
correspondents
like
how
many
times
has
obama
been
to
florida
in
the
general
election
mike
memoli
who
shadowed
bill
clinton
for
nbc
last
winter
said
he
was
sometimes
the
only
tv
reporter
with
him
there
were
no
other
cameras
no
correspondents
so
i
would
film
him
at
each
event
he
said
for
some
embeds
like
the
cbs
producer
maria
gavrilovic
the
assignment
has
lasted
much
longer
than
anticipated
she
was
assigned
to
obama
by
chance
more
than
a
year
ago
she
said
and
expected
the
stint
to
be
shortlived
gavrilovic
worked
on
the
foreign
desk
for
cbs
news
before
the
campaign
and
she
expects
to
return
there
after
the
election
abc
and
the
fox
news
channel
also
lent
staff
members
from
other
departments
but
others
are
not
as
lucky
cnn
and
nbc
relied
on
a
mix
of
newly
hired
employees
and
existing
political
producers
the
contracts
for
the
nbc
journalists
who
were
hired
in
conjunction
with
national
journal
to
follow
the
candidates
expire
on
nov
14
given
the
economic
downturn
the
election
is
ending
at
a
particularly
inopportune
time
for
them
matthew
berger
a
30yearold
nbc
reporter
with
gov
sarah
palin
of
alaska
is
taking
his
mothers
advice
not
to
think
too
hard
about
his
postelection
plans
she
told
me
not
to
ruin
the
last
couple
of
weeks
of
a
great
experience
by
worrying
too
much
about
the
future
he
said
so
ill
worry
about
afterwards
afterwards
marquardt
will
celebrate
his
first
anniversary
at
cnn
three
days
after
the
election
but
as
a
freelancer
he
does
not
know
whether
he
will
be
able
to
stay
with
the
network
so
much
money
has
been
spent
on
this
campaign
and
the
economys
in
the
tank
so
theres
not
that
many
positions
out
there
he
said
although
he
remains
hopeful
although
aignertreworgy
does
not
know
what
he
will
be
doing
in
two
weeks
he
has
started
looking
for
a
new
apartment
in
washington
he
is
looking
forward
to
being
in
the
same
place

more
than
an

aignertreworgy
said
friday
afternoon
i
used
to
know
where
i
was
he
added
sheepishly
surely
some

will
be
on
a
beach
soon

night
offers

the

just
possibly
wrong
the

an

projected

the

will
experiment
with
delivering
election
news
as
if
tallying

wasnt
challenging
enough
the
rule
of
the
night
is
caution
the
networks
learned
a
hard
lesson
in
2000
when
they
erroneously
called
the
election
for
al
gore

similarly
cnn

guru
david

said
were
not
in
a

our
plan
is
to
be
right
not
to
be
first
you
cant
discount
exit
polling
but
understand
its
reflective
of
a
sample
alongi
said
theres
a
difference
between
nbc
has
confirmed
and
nbc
is
reporting
similarly
theres
a
difference
between
too
early
not
enough
votes
to
make
a
projection
and
too
close
to
call
the
statisticians
arent
comfortable
calling
a
race
exit
polling
isnt
definitive
but
it
starts
to
frame
the
story
alongi
said
while
the
networks
maintain
an
embargo
on
calling
races
before
all
of
a
states
polls
are
closed
they
have
no
such
restraint
when
it
comes
to
competitive

gizmos
the
wildest
innovation
cnns

instead
of

per

as
the
american
economy
prospered
no
other
consumer
electronics
product
was
more
desired
than
the
bigscreen
digital
tv
as
the
economy
sputters
and
consumers
hold
back
on
spending
those
tvs
are
still
desired
just
not
as
frequently
purchased
this
holiday
season
retailers
may
have
no
choice
but
to
resort
to
aggressive
pricing
especially
on
lowend
tvs
as
they
try
various
strategies
to
draw
more
people
into
the
stores
the
price
cutting
could
begin
before
black
friday
the
day
after
thanksgiving
when
stores
offer
oneday
bargains
according
to
displaysearch
a
market
research
firm
prices
could
go
as
low
as
400
for
a
32inch
lcd
and
600
for
a
42inch
plasma
set

about
200
off
current
prices
while
stan
glasgow
president
of
sony
electronics
said
his
company
will
not
match
those
prices
he
said
those
numbers
do
not
shock
me
the
watchword
everyone
has
is
uncertainty
said
stephen
baker
vice
president
for
industry
analysis
at
the
npd
group
a
market
research
firm
that
owns
displaysearch
consumers
hoping
to
pick
up
a
bluray
player
at
a
rockbottom
price
will
probably
be
out
of
luck
to
squeeze
out
additional
profits
prices
will
not
drop
much
lower
than
250
this
season
baker
said
there
is
not
enough
demand
for
bluray
to
grow
its
installed
base
look
to
christmas
2009
for
aggressive
pricing
even
with
better
value
for
money
the
question
remains
whether
consumers
will
even
venture
into
the
stores
to
look
people
are
afraid
to
spend
money
baker
said
and
there
is
not
a
lot
one
can
do
to
stimulate
demand
it
is
clear
that
the
consumer
electronics
industry
has
already
slowed
drastically
according
to
paul
semenza
senior
vice
president
of
displaysearch
unit
sales
in
the
united
states
of
lcd
tvs
increased
22
percent
in
september
compared
with
the
same
month
in
2007
but
that
was
less
than
the
28
percent
increase
in
august
and
julys
32
percent
gain
on
a
weekly
basis
yearoveryear
sales
increased
just
3
percent
for
the
week
that
ended
oct
18
compared
with
an
18
percent
gain
for
the
week
that
ended
sept
20
the
data
does
not
include
sales
in
walmart
and
club
stores
like
costco
nevertheless
some
of
the
manufacturers
are
hoping
for
the
best
in
past
recessions
consumer
electronics
has
fared
rather
well
said
glasgow
of
sony
i
believe
well
sell
more
tvs
than
last
year
bob
perry
panasonics
senior
vice
president
for
marketing
concurred
weve
been
through
wars
and
national
calamities
he
said
i
just
dont
see
sales
dropping
off
analysts
are
not
so
sanguine
the
anecdotal
evidence
is
that
the
stores
are
pretty
quiet
semenza
said
there
is
a
whisper
in
the
industry
that
the
retailers
are
ordering
fewer
units
the
sets
that
do
sell
will
probably
be
smaller
while
tv
manufacturers
speak
of
lcd
and
plasma
tvs
in
the
42inch
range
as
their
sweet
spot
for
many
consumers
a
tv
that
big
may
remain
only
a
wish
the
most
popular
tvs
are
in
the
30inch
to
34inch
range
they
account
for
about
26
percent
of
all
sales
tv
screens
from
40
and
44
inches
represent
20
percent
of
unit
sales
the
momentum
was
heading
toward
the
42inch
size
but
now
thats
off
track
that
size
is
the
aspirational
sweet
spot
semenza
said
many
retailers
are
cutting
costs
because
they
expect
a
lighter
selling

that
it

said
well
grow
our
share
by
offering
the
right
solution
product
and
service
were
not
looking
to
get
every
dime
out
of
you
if
a
customer
just
wants
the
lowest
price
on
a
tv
set
well
give
it
to
them
with
a
smile
and
to
increase
the
likelihood
that
customers
will
pull
out
their
wallets
several
manufacturers
including
panasonic
and
sharp
are
working
with
retailers
to
offer
extended
financing
with
either
sameascash
interest
or
deferred
payment
plans
some
believe
that
bundling
items
like
a
flatscreen
tv
with
a
bluray
player
or
an
audio
system
will
provide
that
extra
value
that
will
push
consumers
to
buy
best
buy
will
offer
a
bundle
targeted
to

america
dunn
said
and
panasonic
will
offer
bundles
that
use
its
proprietary
viera
link
technology
that
allows
all
panasonic
components
to
work
with
one
remote
encouraging
consumers
to
stay
with
the
brand
but
not
everyone
believes
in
bundling
putting
a
bundle
out
is
absolutely
the
wrong
thing
to
do
said
baker
of
npd
it
raises
the
absolute
price
to
bolster
sales
manufacturers
like
sharp
and
sony
have
introduced
lowerprice
lines
for
bigbox
stores
this
spring
sony
began
marketing
its

samsung
which
sells
the
most
flatpanel

sees
consumers
deserting
the
midprice
segment
we
may
see
some
shifting
toward
entrylevel
and
stepup
models
said
jonas
tanenbaum
vice

for
lcd
television
marketing
at
samsung
electronics
america
its
the
middle
area
that
may
not
do
as
well
to
capture
those
with
more
limited
budgets
sony
this
year
is
selling
lcd
tvs
in
the
19
26
and
32inch
sizes
there
are
hundreds
of
dollars
of
difference
in
price
between
these
and
stepup
models
glasgow
said
one
other
hope
of
the
manufacturers
and
retailers
the
conversion
this
february
to
a
digital
broadcast
signal
that
makes
most
old
tube
tvs
hooked
to
an
antenna
obsolete
consumers
can
buy
digitaltoanalog
converter
boxes
but
the
industry
is
hoping
many
will
use
the
conversion
as
the
excuse
to
buy
a
new
tv
sharps
32inch
set

at
about
600
its
bestselling
size

is
appealing
to
consumers
looking
to
replace
a
27inch
tube
set
said
bob
scaglione
senior
vice
president
of
the
sharp
electronics
marketing
company
of
america
consumers
usually
buy
based
on
a
set
dollar
amount
scaglione
said
however
we
believe
they
may
concentrate
on
slightly
smaller
screen
sizes
this
holiday
season
the
majority
will
try
to
hang
on
to
32
and
42inch
sets

of

reeve
said
not
many

like

its
not
hurting
anybody
its
kind
of
interesting
really
i
think
people
gripe
about
it
but
the
same
people
drive
by

to
see
whats
going
on
there
the

is
waiting
for

to
start

by
some
measures
one
of
the
most
popular

web

in
the

has
repeatedly
broken
its

yahoo

taken
its

for

said
neeraj
khemlani
the

with
an
increasing
number
of
people
using
the

for
news
sites
like
yahoo
are
treating
election
night
as
a
prime
programming
occasion
the
way
the
television

do
web

have
introduced
and
refined
new
ways
to
track
the
election
from
multiple
streams
of
live
video
to
realtime
graphics
of

patterns
perhaps
the
most
significant
innovations
are
the

the

according

why
pay
for

when
you

the

for

when
frank
magazine
arrived
in
ottawa
in
1989
it
enjoyed
a
near
monopoly
on
sometimes
salacious
gossip
and
mocking
satire
about
politicians
business
figures
and
journalists
last
week
the
magazine
which
once
took
unvarnished
delight
in
the
failings
of
others
stopped
publishing
the
reason
insider
gossip
of
varying
reliability
and
tart
opinions
its
two
mainstays
are
now
both
widely
available
on
the
internet
not
just
on
individuals
blogs
but
on
the
web
sites
of
the
mainstream
newspapers
and
broadcasters
that
were
once
franks
prime
targets
with
circulation
which
had
peaked
at
16000
copies
down
to
about
5000
copies
michael
d
bate
the
editor
and
publisher
said
he
and
his
investors
concluded
that
there
was
no
future
for
frank
a
biweekly
that
was
never
particularly
profitable
it
was
always
a
shoestring
operation
said
bate
a
former
musician
software
developer
and
reporter
with
the
canadian
press
news
service
when
it
was
really
successful
we
had
a
ton
of
lawsuits
when
it
wasnt
so
successful
we
had
lots
of
creditors
in
its
style
design
and
tone
frank
closely
resembled
the
british
magazine
private
eye
both
rejected
glossy
paper
in
favor
of
cheap
newsprint
and
added
cartoon
bubbles
to
photos
frequently
of
politicians
to
create
their
covers
while
the
magazine
was
despised
and
read
often
in
equal
measures
by
many
canadian
journalists
frank
also
broke
news
that
later
received
prominent
coverage
by
other
news
organizations
to
bate
franks
biggest
contribution
was
ending
what
he
called
a
gentlemens
club
among
political
journalists
in
canada
it
was
he
said
an
informal
alliance
that
traded
in
embarrassing
personal
stories
about
politicians
while
guarding
them
from
publication
for
its
regular
targets
frank
used
insider
nicknames
conrad
m
black
the
former
canadian
publisher
now
in
a
florida
prison
for
example
was
lord
tubby
and
while
bate
said
that
the
magazine
tried
to
focus
only
on
prominent
or
influential
people
he
acknowledged
that
innocent
bystanders
nobodies
were
sometimes
unfairly
made
the
subject
of
articles
but
thats
the
business
we
were
in
going
too
far
because
it
is
comparatively
difficult
for
publishers
to
defend
libel
lawsuits
in
canada
they
were
a
constant
drain
on
frank
which
is
not
to
say
frank
was
always
innocent
a
judge
from
quebec
successfully
sued
frank
for
writing
that
he
had
hired
a
prostitute
at
the
time
the
episode
was
supposed
to
have
taken
place
the
judge
was
in
israel
with
his
church
choir
frank
frequently
pushed
the
boundaries
of
good
taste
late
in
his
tenure
as
prime
minister
brian
mulroney
a
conservative
attended
a
number
of
prominent
events
with
his
attractive
young
daughter
rather
than
his
wife
mila
frank
responded
with
a
mock
contest
open
to
young
conservative
party
members
that
offered
a
sexual
encounter
with
the
prime
ministers
daughter
as
its
grand
prize
mulroney
later
told
a
television
interviewer
that
contest
had
made
him
want
to
acquire
a
gun
to
do
serious
damage
to
these
people
although
mulroney
left
politics
in
1993
bate
is
nostalgic
about
his
tenure
i
find
canadian
politics
now
so
dull
beyond
belief
dull
he
said
theyre
a
bunch
of
ciphers
were
in
ottawa
were
a
political
satire
magazine
and
i
dont
like
politics

so
ive
got
a
problem

saluting

year

unveiled
its

award
last

it
went
to
kenneth

lewis
chief
of

of
america
while
lewis
is
a
respected
executive
2008
hardly
seems
like
the
year
for
any
banker
given
how
unpopular
the
industry
is
these
days
hes
a
great
executive
and
b
of
as
a
great
bank
said
jj
hornblass
the

editor
of

it
just
doesnt
seem
like
the
right
time
to
be
dancing
in
the
streets
and
celebrating
banking
richard
melville
of
american
banker
said
editors
there
felt
they
had
to
laud
someone
this
year
we
never
thought
twice
about
it
said
melville
editorial
director
for
the
banking
publications
of
sourcemedia
which
owns
american
banker
we
cover
banking
we
dont
stop
covering
banking
during
a
bad
cycle
but
the
discussions
this
year
were
more
complicated
than
usual
in
most
years
by
the
time
july
august
rolls
around
you
have
a
sense
for
what
you
think
he
said
this
year
was
not
a
year
where
you
can
sit
there
and
say
with
any
great
level
of
confidence
that
you
understood
the
present
the
present
was
changing
very
quickly
corporate
executives
fortunes
can
fall
quickly
as
many
an
embarrassed
business
editor
knows
for
example
in
2001
fortune
put
enron
on
its
most
admired

and

put

on
its

under
the
headline
the

a
week
later
skilling
resigned
as
enron
began
falling
apart
in
2002
kozlowski
resigned
both
skilling
and
kozlowski
are
now
convicted
felons
but
melville
said
he
was
confident
his
list
of
best
bankers
was
solid
you
wouldnt
find
on
that
list
many
people
who
are
being
vilified
right
now
he
said
how
do
you
judge
an
industry
do
you
judge
it
by
the
ones
who
are
doing
well
or
the
ones
who
are
not
doing
well
by
the
ones
whose
practices
you
respect
or
the
ones
whose
practices
you
dont

but
it

the

sean

scott

had
a
frontrow
seat
as
the
bottom
fell
out
of
the
financial
markets
weve
been
capturing
a
lot
of
drama
lately
skelton
said
friday
as
he
was
shooting
in
manhattan
weve
got
the
backlash
of
the
credit
crisis
from
last
year
which
we
started
capturing
about
halfway
through
the
second
season
so
things
started
off
bad
this
year
but
about
halfway
through
our
season
this
year
things
have
gotten
really
bad
with
the
bank
failures
and
the
bailout
and
the
drama
then
about
a
month
ago
the
bottom
fell
out
for
wall
street
warriors
itself
when
the
highdefinition
cable
channel
that
has
been
carrying
the
show
mojohd
announced
that
it
would
cease
operations
in
december
it
kind
of
happened
at
the
same
time
as
the
markets
were
diving
gill
said
in
a
telephone
interview
from
los
angeles
skelton
added
i
guess
its
somewhat
ironic
that
its
happening
but
mojo
which
reached
only
about
10
million
homes
at
its
peak
told
the
team
to
finish
production
and
promised
to
work
with
it
to
find
a
new
home
for
the
show
warriors
reached
no

on
itunes
in
july
for
downloads
of
reality
television
series
well
be
done
with
production
in
the
next
four
to
six
weeks
skelton
said
well
be
done
editing
the
show
probably
by
february
or
march
he
said
that
the
team
is
continuing
to
document
the
turmoil
on
wall
street
and
is
committed
to
finding
an
outlet
to
distribute
the
series
and
with
the
optimism
of
stockbrokers
telling
their
clients
to
stay
in
the
market
skelton
and
gill
say
they
are
confident
that
they
will
find
a
new

what
really
weirds
out
weird
al
visitors
to
mtvs
new
online
music
video
site
can
listen
to
songs
with
plenty
of
crass
and
vulgar
lyrics
but
may
be
surprised
to
find
that
certain
other
language
had
once
been
deemed
too
nasty
for

that
is
the

of
the
filesharing
sites
morpheus
grokster

kazaa

the

weird
al

whose
lyrics
to
dont
download
this
song
a
tongueincheek
complaint
about
filesharing
first
released
in
2006
included
those
socalled
offensive
terms
since
then
two
of
those
sites

grokster
and
morpheus

have
become
inactive
in
an
email
message
on
sunday
yankovic
wrote
that
he
had
bleeped
out
the
names
to
the
filesharing
sites
in
his
song
two
years
ago
after
mtv
told
me
that
they
would
refuse
to
air
my
video
otherwise
instead
of
subtly
removing
or
obscuring
the
words
in
the
track
he
wrote
i
made
the
creative
decision
to
bleep
them
out
as
obnoxiously
as
possible
so
that
there
would
be
no
mistake
i
was
being
censored
he
complied
because
i
was
proud
of
the
song
and
the
accompanying
bill
plympton
video
and
i
wanted
to
do
everything
i
could
to
maximize
exposure
for
it
all
of
this
would
have
been
largely
forgotten
if
not
for
the
introduction
last
week
of

project
like

a
partnership
among
companies
including
mtvs

to
wrest
control

from

nearly
20000
music
videos
available

once
the

stock
in

to
play
browse
or
imbed
on
other
sites
the

is
still
in
beta
or
introductory
phase
and
perhaps
that
is
why
a
visitor
to
the
site
can
quickly
search
for
music
lyrics
cruder
than
even
the
usual
litany
of
gangster
rap
bravado
patti
smith
for
example

a
song
with
a
title
that
cant
be

and
introduces
it

an
expletive

visitor
looked
up

song
there
heard
the
bleeps
passed
it
on
to
online
technology
sites
like
techdirt
blog
and
the
censorship
battle
ensued
an
mtv
spokesman
did
not
respond
sunday
to
a

comment
im
not
really
sure
if
mtv
ever
even
played
the

on

after
all
that
he
wrote
but
now
that
its
apparently
up

robinson

in

robinson
had
never
thrown

but
he
caught
one
longer
he
was
a
junior
at
chatfield
we
were
on
our
2yard
line
robinson
told
reporters
after
the
game
it
was
almost
identical
a
slant
pass
but
it
was
on
the
right
side
it
was
against

colo

thats
what
you
live

a
chance
to
bring
your
team
back
down
the

against
a
great
team
harrell
told
reporters
after
the
game
if
youre
a
quarterback
and
you
dont
want
to
be
in
that
situation
you
should
probably
change
positions

didnt
want
to
say
it
but
i
told
you
so
texas
achilles

it
proved
it
on

saturday
night
blake

on

the

the

wont

the

if
both
beat

the

possibly
the

will
likely
be

nov

when

the

is

john
henderson
is
a
sports
columnist
for
the
denver
post
maybe
the
polls
are
wrong
and
john
mccain
is
about
to
pull
off
the
biggest
election
upset
in
american
history
but
right
now
the
democrats
seem
poised
both
to
win
the
white
house
and
to
greatly
expand
their
majorities
in
both
houses
of
congress
most
of
the
postelection
discussion
will
presumably
be
about
what
the
democrats
should
and
will
do
with
their
mandate
but
let
me
ask
a
different
question
that
will
also
be
important
for
the
nations
future
what
will
defeat
do
to
the
republicans
you
might
think
perhaps
hope
that
republicans
will
engage
in
some
soulsearching
that
theyll
ask
themselves
whether
and
how
they
lost
touch
with
the
national
mainstream
but
my
prediction
is
that
this
wont
happen
any
time
soon
instead
the
republican
rump
the
party
thats
left
after
the
election
will
be
the
party
that
attends
sarah
palins
rallies
where
crowds
chant
vote
mccain
not
hussein
it
will
be
the
party
of
saxby
chambliss
the
senator
from
georgia
who
observing
largescale
early
voting
by
africanamericans
warns
his
supporters
that
the
other
folks
are
voting
it
will
be
the
party
that
harbors
menacing
fantasies
about
barack
obamas
marxist

or
was
that
islamic

roots
why
will
the
gop
become
more
not
less
extreme
for
one
thing
projections
suggest
that
this
election
will
drive
many
of
the
remaining
republican
moderates
out
of
congress
while
leaving
the
hard
right
in
place
for
example
larry
sabato
the
election
forecaster
predicts
that
seven
senate
seats
currently
held
by
republicans
will
go
democratic
on
tuesday
according
to
the
liberalconservative
rankings
of
the
political
scientists
keith
poole
and
howard
rosenthal
five
of
the
soontobegone
senators
are
more
moderate
than
the
median
republican
senator

so
the
rump
the
gop
caucus
that
remains
will
have
shifted
further
to
the
right
the
same
thing
seems
set
to
happen
in
the
house
also
the
republican
base
already
seems
to
be
gearing
up
to
regard
defeat
not
as
a
verdict
on
conservative
policies
but
as
the
result
of
an
evil
conspiracy
a
recent
democracy
corps
poll
found
that
republicans
by
a
margin
of
more
than
two
to
one
believe
that
mccain
is
losing
because
the
mainstream
media
is
biased
rather
than
because
americans
are
tired
of
george
bush
and
mccain
has
laid
the
groundwork
for
feverish
claims
that
the
election
was
stolen
declaring
that
the
community
activist
group
acorn

which
as
factcheckorg
points
out
has
never
been
found
guilty
of
or
even
charged
with
causing
fraudulent
votes
to
be
cast

is
now
on
the
verge
of
maybe
perpetrating
one
of
the
greatest
frauds
in
voter
history
in
this
country
maybe
destroying
the
fabric
of
democracy
needless
to
say
the
potential
voters
acorn
tries
to
register
are
disproportionately
other
folks
as
chambliss
might
put
it
anyway
the
republican
base
egged
on
by
the
mccainpalin
campaign
thinks
that
elections
should
reflect
the
views
of
real
americans

and
most
of
the
people
reading
this
column
probably
dont
qualify
thus
in
the
face
of
polls
suggesting
that
obama
will
win
virginia
a
top
mccain
aide
declared
that
the
real
virginia

the
southern
part
of
the
state
excluding
the
washington
dc
suburbs

favors
mccain
a
majority
of
americans
now
live
in
big
metropolitan
areas
but
while
visiting
a
small
town
in
north
carolina
palin
described
it
as
what
i
call
the
real
america
one
of
the
proamerica
parts
of
the
nation
the
real
america
it
seems
is
smalltown
mainly
southern
and
above
all
white
im
not
saying
that
the
gop
is
about
to
become
irrelevant
republicans
will
still
be
in
a
position
to
block
some
democratic
initiatives
especially
if
the
democrats
fail
to
achieve
a
filibusterproof
majority
in
the
senate
and
that
blocking
ability
will
ensure
that
the
gop
continues
to
receive
plenty
of
corporate
dollars
this
year
the
us
chamber
of
congress
has
poured
money
into
the
campaigns
of
senate
republicans
like
minnesotas
norm
coleman
precisely
in
the
hope
of
denying
democrats
a
majority
large
enough
to
pass
prolabor
legislation
but
the
gops
long
transformation
into
the
party
of
the
unreasonable
right
a
haven
for
racists
and
reactionaries
seems
likely
to
accelerate
as
a
result
of
the
impending
defeat
this
will
pose
a
dilemma
for
moderate
conservatives
many
of
them
spent
the
bush
years
in
denial
closing
their
eyes
to
the
administrations
dishonesty
and
contempt
for
the
rule
of
law
some
of
them
have
tried
to
maintain
that
denial
through
this
years
election
season
even
as
the
mccainpalin
campaigns
tactics
have
grown
ever
uglier
but
one
of
these
days
theyre
going
to
have
to
realize
that
the
gop
has
become
the
party
of
intolerance
barack
obama
will
probably
win
the
2008
presidential
election
if
he
does
we
conservatives
will
greet
the
news
with
our
usual
resolute
stoicism
or
cheerful
fatalism
being
conservative
means
never
being
too
surprised
by
disappointment
but
what
if
john
mccain
pulls
off
an
upset
im
worried
about
my
compatriots
on
the
left
michael
powell
reports
in
saturdays
new
york
times
that
even
the
possibility
of
an
obama
defeat
has
driven
many
liberals
into
in
a
state
of
high
anxiety
and
then
theres
a
young
woman
from
denver
who
told
her
boyfriend
that
their
love
life
was
on
hold
while
she
sweated
out
mr
obamas
performance
in
colorado
well
what
if
obama
loses
colorado
or
the
presidency
as
a
compassionate
conservative
im
concerned
about
the
wellbeing
of
that
boyfriend

and
of
others
who
might
be
similarly
situated
i
feel
an
obligation
to
help
so
let
me
tell
liberals
why
they
should
be
cheerful
if
mccain
happens
to
win
1
it
would
be
a
victory
for
an
underdog
liberals
are
supposed
to
like
underdogs
mccain
is
a
lonely
guy
standing
up
against
an
unprecedentedly
wellfinanced
superorganized
exxonmobillike
obama
juggernaut
a
mccain
upset
victory
would
be
a
classic
liberal
happy
ending
2
it
would
be
a
defeat
for
the
establishment
obamas
most
recent
highprofile
republican
endorser
was
dc
insider
kenneth
duberstein
liberals
should
be
on
the
side
of
hardworking
plumbers
not
bigshot
lobbyists

oops
sorry
bigshot
strategic
advisers
and
consultants
and
duberstein
said
that
colin
powells
endorsement
was
the
good
housekeeping
seal
of
approval
on
barack
obama
doesnt
that
comment
embody
everything
that
liberals
and
many
conservatives
including
me
find
creepy
about
smug
establishment
backscratching
and
gatekeeping
in
america
3
it
would
be
a
victory
for
the
future
with
president
bushs
approval
rating
at
about
25
percent
a
mccain
triumph
would
mean
americans
were
making
a
judgment
on
two
future
alternatives
not
merely
voting
on
the
basis
of
their
resentment
at
the
past
performance
of
george
w
bush
it
would
mean
voters
were
looking
ahead
not
back
liberals
should
therefore
welcome
a
mccain
win
as
a
triumph
of
hope
over
fear
of
the
future
over
the
past
4
it
would
be
a
victory
for
freedom
obama
supporter
leon
wieseltier
of
the
new
republic
writes
that
tyrants
and
genocidaires
would
sleep
less
soundly
during
a
mccain
presidency
liberals
should
be
opposed
to
tyranny
and
genocide
wieseltier
also
acknowledges
that
mccain
was
splendidly
right
about
the
surge
which
is
not
a
small
thing
and
the
grudging
way
obama
treats
the
reversal
in
iraq
when
he
treats
it
at
all
is
disgraceful
the
surge
advanced
not
only
our
national
security
but
the
cause
of
freedom
in
the
world
liberals
should
be
votaries
of
freedom
5
a
mccain
victory
would
be
good
for
liberalism
look
at
recent
history
jimmy
carter
and
a
democratic
congress
begat
ronald
reagan
bill
clinton
and
a
democratic
congress
produced
newt
gingrich
who
knows
what
would
follow
a
president
obama
and
a
democratic
congress
heres
one
possibility
president
sarah
palin
so
liberals
shouldnt
be
too
upset
at
the
idea
of
mccain
winning
could
it
happen
its
possible
what
if
the
polls
for
various
reasons
are
overstating
obamas
support
by
a
couple
points
and
what
if
the
late
deciders
break
overwhelmingly
against
obama
as
they
did
in
the
democratic
primaries
mccain
could
then
thread
the
electoral
college
needle
mccain
would
have
to
win
every
state
where
he
now
leads
or
is
effectively
even
in
the
polls
including
north
carolina
indiana
and
missouri
hed
have
to
take
florida
and
ohio
where
hes
about
four
points
down
but
where
operatives
on
the
ground
give
him
a
pretty
good
shot
that
gets
him
to
247
of
the
270
votes
needed
mccains
path
to
victory
is
then
to
snatch
pennsylvania
which
gets
him
to
268
and
win
either
virginia
colorado
nevada
or
new
mexico
states
where
he
trails
by
about
four
to
seven
points

or
new
hampshire
where
hes
10
points
behind
but
twice
won
dramatic
primary
victories
as
for
pennsylvania
two
recent
polls
have
mccain
closing
to
within
four
points
pennsylvania
is
the
state
whose
smalltown
residents
were
famously
patronized
by
obama
as
bitter
one
of
pennsylvanias
democratic
congressmen
john
murtha
recently
accused
many
of
his
western
pennsylvania
constituents
of
being
racist
perhaps
pennsylvanians
will
want
to
send
a
little
message
to
the
democratic
party
and
that
could
tip
the
election
to
mccain
its
an
inside
straight
but
ive
seen
gamblers
draw
them
if
mccain
wins
think
of
this
column
as
a
modest
contribution
to
cheering
up
distraught
liberals
if
obama
prevails
im
confident
there
are
some
compassionate
liberals
out
there
who
will
do
the
same
for
hapless
conservatives
as
they
hobble
out
to
the
wilderness
by
the
end
of
the
giants
3514
rout
of
dallas
on
sunday
jerry
jones
the
cowboys
owner
might
have
searched
the
waiver
wire
for
seth
maxwell
the
quarterback
in
peter
gents
1973
novel
north
dallas
forty
who
could
blame
him
with
tony
romo
out
for
the
third
consecutive
week
with
a
broken
pinkie
the
cowboys
looked
weak
on
offense
first
with
brad
johnson
at
quarterback
then
with
brooks
bollinger
the
giants
intercepted
three
passes
romo
is
expected
back
for
the
next
game
after
dallas
bye
week
in
the
meantime
the
lastplace
cowboys

will
look
up
and
at
some
distance
in
the
national
football
conference
east
to
the
firstplace
giants
71
were
not
what
i
thought
we
would
be
at
the
backup
jones
said
after
the
game
as
his
players
filed
out
past
him
but
i
dont
want
to
load
this
whole
thing
on
the
backup
quarterback
hes
not
playing
behind
the
team
that
i
thought
wed
be
playing
behind
giants
quarterback
eli
manning
threw
three
touchdown
passes
but
turned
the
ball
over
three
times
twice
on
fumbles
and
once
on
an
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
he
completed
16
of
27
passes
for
147
yards
his
touchdown
passes
were
to
kevin
boss
13
yards
steve
smith
5
yards
and
amani
toomer
11
yards
running
back
brandon
jacobs
carried
17
times
for
117
yards
including
a
touchdown
run
of
12
yards
derrick
ward
had
a
17yard
touchdown
run
several
key
cowboys
missed
the
game
with
injuries
which
would
have
made
a
dallas
victory
a
shock
in
this
game
between
longstanding
rivals
the
cowboys
were
a
popular
preseason
pick
to
win
the
super
bowl
and
the
giants
are
the
defending
super
bowl
champions
so
the
feelings
between
the
teams
were
especially
sensitive
we
hate
each
other
thats
just
how
it
is
jacobs
said
defensive
end
justin
tuck
who
had
two
and
a
half
of
the
giants
four
sacks
said
more
gently
i
dont
like
to
throw
the
word
hatred
around
theres
a
dislike
that
comes
from
mutual
respect
tuck
added
that
the
giants
still
must
play
four
divisional
games
including
one
at
dallas
against
what
may
be
a
healthy
romo
were
not
smiling
at
anything
now
tuck
said
tuck
and
his
fellow
defenders
held
running
back
marion
barber
to
54
yards
on
19
carries
cornerback
corey
webster
intercepted
two
passes
by
johnson
and
safety
james
butler
stole
one
by
bollinger
webster
said
they
were
just
doing
their
share
the
dlinemen
have
been
doing
their
thing
for
a
number
of
years
webster
said
it
was
our
time
to
pick
up
our
end
of
the
deal
mannings
interception
in
the
second
quarter
led
to
a
23yard
touchdown
return
by
mike
jenkins
that
cut
the
giants
lead
to
147
the
pass
was
intended
for
plaxico
burress
who
ran
long
and
behind
the
secondary
as
manning
expected
him
to
cut
off
a
shorter
route
i
read
one
thing
and
he
didnt
burress
said
and
it
resulted
in
a
touchdown
for
those
guys
on
the
sideline
immediately
afterward
burress
appeared
to
speak
in
a
demonstrative
way
waving
his
arms
afterward
manning
seemed
to
confirm
the
diagnosis
of
burress
he
probably
made
the
right
read
manning
said
a
bad
play
by
me
referring
to
his
teams
status
at
midseason
manning
said
seven
and
one
is
a
great
place
to
be
we
couldnt
ask
for
much
more
burress
later
dropped
two
passes
including
one
in
the
end
zone
but
he
was
not
the
only
giant
unable
to
capture
catchable
balls
ward
and
madison

also
dropped
passes
in
last
weeks
2114
victory
at
pittsburgh
the
giants
dropped
five
passes
the
cowboys
made
it
close
again
briefly
in
the
first
minute
of
the
fourth
quarter
when
bollinger
threw
an
8yard
touchdown
pass
to
terrell
owens
that
cut
the
giants
lead
to
2814
the
drive
traveling
75
yards
and
lasting
16
plays
was
aided
by
a
roughingthepasser
call
against
tuck
the
play
appeared
to
be
a
clean
hard
knockdown
after
an
incomplete
pass
on
third
down
tuck
was
flagged
for
landing
with
his
full
274
pounds
on
the
quarterback
i
thought
the
object
of
hitting
the
quarterback
is
to
land
on
him
tuck
said
i
guess
in
the
air
ive
got
to
twist
my
body
to
land
on
the
ground
down
the
hall
jones
had
other
things
to
worry
about
but
as
the
giants
showed
the
cowboys
last
season
with
a
postseason
upset
in
dallas
the
division
winners
do
not
always
win
their
playoff
games
and
the
wildcard
qualifier
can
win
the
super
bowl
you
have
to
be
quite
the
optimist
and
i
dont
know
that
im
that
much
of
an
optimist
jones
said
of
the
divisional
race
but
he
added
crazy
things
happen
it
doesnt
change
what
i
think
we
have
a
chance
to
do
in
the
face
of
a
bitter
defeat
denver
broncos
receiver
brandon
marshall
turned
and
ran
is
that
how
a
winner
acts
or
did
marshall
quit
hes
one
of
those
soft
receivers
where
he
has
to
have
the
ball
all
the
time
if
he
dont
get
it
hes
going
to
mope
and
cry
miami
dolphins
linebacker
joey
porter
said
sunday
if
you
believe
porter
one
of
the
main
reasons
the
dolphins
upset
denver
2617
sunday
is
because
the
visitors
got
in
the
face
of
marshall
and
messed
with
his
mind
until
the
young
receiver
cracked
we
got
in
his
head
and
he
pretty
much
was
done
said
porter
who
insisted
marshall
psyched
himself
right
out
of
the
game
faced
with
the
harsh
reality
of
the
final
score
frustrated
by
a
lousy
individual
performance
victimized
by
a
bad
call
that
nullified
a
touchdown
catch
and
dissed
by
smack
talk
for
which
he
had
no
response
marshall
quickly
bolted
off
the
field
and
into
the
stadium
tunnel
leading
to
the
denver
locker
room
on
a
reeling
denver
team
that
has
dropped
four
of
five
decisions
after
a
30
start
its
fair
to
ask
is
marshall
mentally
tough
enough
to
lead
the
broncos
out
of
this
mess
im
definitely
disappointed
admitted
marshall
credited
with
only
two
catches
for
27
yards
against
the
dolphins
definitely
frustrated
and
it
showed
i
went
looking
for
him
after
the
game
but
he
ran
to
the
locker
room
said
porter
who
loves
to
talk
trash
and
has
the
pro
bowl
credentials
to
back
up
his
sharp
tongue
did
porter
actually
try
to
track
down
marshall
yeah
how
do
you
know
i
seen
that
he
was
the
first
one
off
the
field
i
was
looking
for
him
and
he
was
the
first
one
out
of
there
porter
said
as
defenses
have
gotten
tougher
on
marshall
and
his
receiving
numbers
have
gone
in
steady
decline
opponents
now
see
how
he
pouts
its
a
sign
of
vulnerability
no
player
can
afford
in
the
nfl
im
not
selfish
but
im
a
wide
receiver
marshall
said
im
not
asking
for
the
ball
every
play
but
i
would
love
for
us
to
throw
every
play
from
the
anger
with
which
marshall
snapped
the
chinstrap
off
his
helmet
when
his
77yard
touchdown
catch
was
wiped
out
by
a
pass
interference
penalty
that
appeared
incorrect
to
the
way
quarterback
jay
cutler
trudges
back
to
the
bench
after
another
ineffective
set
of
downs
by
an
offense
that
has
lost
its
mojo
the
body
language
of
denvers
young
stars
too
often
suggests
they
are
beaten
men
porter
knows
any
player
capable
of
catching
18
passes
in
a
single
game
is
talented
but
heres
his
advice
to
marshall
grow
up
rather
than
taking
the
doublecoverage
the
dolphins
used
to
blanket
marshall
as
a
compliment
he
got
so
mad
that
porter
detected
an
undeniable
loss
of
composure
if
marshall
comes
unglued
how
can
we
expect
the
broncos
to
keep
it
together
even
in
the
afc
west
the
division
that
makes
a
parody
of
parity
the
team
needs
marshall
to
lead
not
whine
during
a
break
in
the
action
before
the
fourth
quarter
began
porter
broke
away
from
miamis
defensive
huddle
to
shout
across
the
line
of
scrimmage
at
marshall
until
he
could
no
longer
ignore
the
abuse
it
was
a
pitiful
sight
for
a
broncos
team
that
now
appears
too
immature
and
emotionally
fragile
to
handle
the
pressure
of
a
league
that
shows
no
mercy
for
the
weak
or
wounded
once
i
know
youre
frustrated
im
going
to
ride
you
all
the
way
into
the
dirt
porter
said
i
seen
he
was
frustrated
because
he
went
from
not
talking
to
me
to
wanting
to
talk
to
me
every
play
why
you
talking
to
me
im
not
even
covering
you
so
when
you
give
me
all
your
attention
i
know
youre
not
on
your
game
unnerved
to
the
point
of
distraction
in
front
of
75000
irked
paying
customers
all
marshall
could
do
was
stand
there
and
take
the
tonguelashing
from
an
opponent
laughing
in
his
face
if
this
is
where
this
denver
team
comes
undone
then
we
will
remember
it
as
the
sad
scene
where
the
season
faded
to
black
mark

what
the

established
sunday
was
they
cant

the
broncos
established
their
alltime
secondnastiest
rushing
yardage
total
for
one
game

14
yards
they
had
5
pathetic
rushing
yards
at
halftime
3

yes
3
because
of
a
2yard
loss

in
the
middle
of
the
third
quarter
they
had
only
7
yards
until
the
last
meaningless
run
for

fourteen

and
the

were
a
cloud
of
dust
sunday
afternoon
pittman
seven

for

and
hurt
again
torain
three
runs
for

zero

quarterback
jay
cutler
ran

but
he

cutler
threw

he
has
dropped
from
most
valuable
player
consideration
to
the
most
valueless
fantasy
category
this
may
be
a
rush
to
judgment
but
the
broncos
are
the
worstreeking
firstplace
team
in
the
history
of
american
professional
football
at
the
halfway
point
the
broncos
are
at
their
lowest
point

44
some
run
theyre
having
now
daylight
saving
time
goes
and
the
broncos
run
to
darkness
as
in
2007
the
broncos
season
might
as
well
be
over
on
nov
1
in
1972
against
the
oakland
raiders
the
broncos
ran
for
only
13
yards
so
the
broncos
finally
raced
past
that
number
against
miami
until
sunday
the
next
meager
mark
was
20
against
dallas

the
dallas
texans
of
the
afl
in
1961
the
broncos
never
have
run
for
fewer
than
5
yards
in
a
first
half

as
far
as
anybody
could
tell
and
heres
how
the
broncos
established
run
on
the
first
play
of
the
game
pittman
lost
a
yard
then
gained
a
yard
to
be
back
where
he
started
then
cutler
flung
his
eighth
interception
of
the
season
the
broncos
couldnt
establish
the
passing
game
either
in
the
rest
of
the
quarter
pittman
went
for
2
yards
torain
for
3
torain
for
minus2
that
would
be
3
reeking
yards
they
added
two
more
in
the
half
thats
not
a
joke
but
the
running
game
certainly
was
a
joke
where
have

despite

and
as
shanahan
had
suggested
he
is
an
injury
always
happening
pittman
was
impressive
briefly
but
got
a
stinger
and
left
early
on
sunday
hall
fumbled
twice
against

and
didnt
participate
against

until

torain
who
is
supposed
to
be
ryans
express
or
the
great

or
somebody
looked
ordinary
in
his
brief
time
the
broncos
best
player
on
sunday
was
a
fullback
catching
passes
torain
said
the
dolphins
did
a
good
job
of
stopping
the
run
squid
could
have
done
a
good
job
of
stopping
the
broncos
runners
just
when
it
seems
like
shanahan
cant
be
more
ashamed
of
his
performance
as
a
coach
see
an
oct
20
monday
night
game
at
new
england
the
broncos
after
a
bye
to
reconsider
life
scored
fewer
than
20
points
for
the
fifth
consecutive
game
and
turned
an
awesome
autumn
afternoon
into
a
painting
of
a
howling
man

shanahan
if
shanahans
intention
was
to
establish
the
running
game
he
should
have
called
more
than
10
running
plays
cutlers
one
does
not
count
in
the
first
three
quarters

compared
to
32
passing
plays
its
not
as
if
the
broncos
were
being
blown
out
again
at
1610
they
needed
only
one
touchdown
and
the
way
cutler
is
overthrowing
underthowing
throwing
over
and
under
to
the
other
team
running
seems
like
the
right
idea
weve
been
told
that
the
offensive
line
is
zoneblocking
well
twilight
zone
blocking
apparently
if
young
and
pittman
are
injuryprone
and
hall
is
injuryprone
and
torain
is
not
ready
why
didnt
the
broncos
sign
shaun
alexander
who
joined
portis
in
washington
and
its
not
as
if
the
broncos
were
playing
against

noname
defense
the
broncos
should
be
playing

names
our

autumn
had
always
been
good
to
jim
leyritz
most
of
the
time
leyritz
was
just
a
workaday
yankee
on
a
team
of
stars
but
the
postseason
seemed
to
be
his
stage
as
he
twirled
his
bat
at
the
plate
and
hit
home
runs
when
it
mattered
most
but
this
has
been
a
very
different
fall
for
leyritz
now
44
and
eight
years
into
his
retirement
from
baseball
he
has
been
shunned
by
the
yankees
the
nearly
11
million
he
earned
as
a
player
is
gone
along
with
his
lucrative
speaking
career
leyritz
is
awaiting
trial
in
florida
on
charges
of
manslaughter
and
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
after
a
crash
last
december
that
killed
30yearold
fredia
ann
veitch
if
convicted
he
faces
up
to
15
years
in
prison
the
player
once
known
for
his
designer
sunglasses
and
outsize
swagger
is
so
broke
that
he
said
he
had
sought
aid
from
the
baseball
assistance
team
a
charity
that
helps
former
players
through
tough
times
they
basically
have
been
a
savior
leyritz
said
in
a
recent
interview
if
it
wasnt
for
them
i
dont
know
what
i
would
have
done
the
fable
of
the
selfdestructive
athlete
has
been
told
before
and
the
leyritz
version
follows
a
familiar
outline
misspent
fortune
messy
divorce
fast
lifestyle
and
a
trip
to
the
county
jail
but
other
details
of
his
life
do
not
fit
as
easily
into
the
typical
narrative
leyritz
is
the
primary
caregiver
to
his
three
sons
ages
13
12
and
7
who
live
with
him
in
the
spotless
home
he
rents
in
davie
a
fort
lauderdale
suburb
after
his
divorce
and
custody
battle
friends
say
leyritz
started
over
and
began
earning
a
comfortable
income
from
television
appearances
and
corporate
speaking
engagements
then
came
the
crash
a
jury
will
decide
whether
it
was
the
result
of
criminal
behavior
and
the
trial
is
scheduled
to
begin
next
monday
leyritzs
friends
and
advocates
say
that
no
matter
the
outcome
his
children
need
him
for
emotional
and
financial
support
a
day
after
veitch
died
one
of
her
children
sent
her
a
text
message
writing
i
love
you
momma
rest
in
peace
according
to
telephone
records
in
the
state
attorneys
file
howard
pomerantz
a
lawyer
for
veitchs
family
said
no
one
was
helping
her
14yearold
daughter
and
5yearold
son
he
described
leyritz
as
someone
who
has
destroyed
the
lives
of
a
number
of
people
and
questioned
the
propriety
of
giving
him
assistance
id
be
interested
in
learning
whether
the
baseball
assistance
team
takes
into
consideration
whether
theyre
pouring
salt
in
the
wounds
in
the
victims
in
this
case
he
said
jim
martin
the
executive
director
of
the
baseball
assistance
team
spoke
about
the
program
only
in
general
because
of
privacy
restrictions
and
declined
to
say
whether
leyritz
was
receiving
help
in
2008
the
charity
has
awarded
more
than
175
assistant
grants
to
people
affiliated
with
baseball
but
he
said
he
did
not
pass
judgment
on
those
in
need
especially
when
children
were
involved
its
not
the
kids
fault
when
someone
does
something
stupid
martin
said
leyritzs
predicament
is
starkly
different
from
his
days
as
a
yankee
he
was
with
the
team
from
1990
through
1996
then
in
1999
and
2000
he
is
probably
best
known
for
his
threerun
homer
in
game
4
of
the
1996
world
series
which
tied
the
score
and
led
to
a
victory
over
atlanta
in
the
clubhouse
leyritz
had
a
reputation
as
a
brash
upstart
and
he
was
overshadowed
by
teammates
like
don
mattingly
and
derek
jeter
still
fans
appreciated
his
clutch
performances
in
the
postseason
by
the
time
he
left
baseball
in
2000
leyritz
had
earned
at
least
107
million
in
11
major
league
seasons
according
to
the
web
site
baseballreferencecom
like
many
professional
athletes
facing
retirement
leyritz
struggled
with
living
an
ordinary
life
he
and
his
wife
karri
leyritz
consumed
lavishly
during
his
yankees
career
in
court
filings
leyritzs
lawyer
acknowledged
that
they
had
spent
most
of
his
baseball
earnings
by
2002
when
he
filed
for
divorce
by
then
little
was
left
to
fight
over
besides
their
three
sons
the
12
volumes
of
divorce
records
on
file
at
the
broward
county
courthouse
depict
a
vicious
battle
in
which
the
couple
bickered
over
everything
from
who
should
get
the
ford
expedition
to
the
whereabouts
of
leyritzs
1999
world
series
ring
in
2004
a
social
worker
concluded
in
a
custody
evaluation
that
neither
leyritz
was
an
ideal
parent
karri
leyritzs
livein
boyfriend
had
a
long
criminal
history
and
in
2003
she
tested
positive
for
benzodiazepines
antianxiety
drugs
for
which
she
did
not
have
a
prescription
jim
leyritz
according
to
the
report
used
amphetamines
and
drank
heavily
as
a
player
the
social
worker
also
reported
that
a
marriage
counselor
determined
that
he
was
struggling
with
learning
to
cope
with
life
transitions
and
adjusting
to
life
without
baseball
he
and
his
wife
leyritz
told
the
social
worker
had
led
a
partying
lifestyle
but
he
also
said
my
life
is
my
children
i
have
had
my
fun
now
they
are
more
important
to
me
the
social
worker
ultimately
recommended
that
the
leyritzes
share
parenting
responsibilities
but
that
jim
leyritz
be
the
primary
residential
parent
although
the
leyritzes
were
unemployed
they
frequently
placed
the
children
in
afterschool
day
care
and
in
karris
case
left
them
with
baby
sitters
according
to
the
custody
evaluation
and
the
transcript
of
a
hearing
before
the
divorce
judge
teachers
reported
that
the
children
were
often
absent
when
in
karris
care
and
when
they
did
attend
they
did
not
have
lunch
were
missing
socks
or
wore
disheveled
torn
uniforms
judge
lawrence
korda
admonished
the
leyritzes
to
spend
more
time
with
their
children
to
me
if
two
parents
arent
working
and
both
of
them
are
posing
as
incredibly
involved
parents
then
go
get
your
kids
he
said
after
an
initial
interview
in
september
leyritz
declined
to
answer
further
questions
including
inquiries
about
his
divorce
saying
he
was
speaking
exclusively
to
another
publication
but
karri
leyritz
said
the
breakup
coincided
with
his
exit
from
professional
baseball
and
was
a
difficult
period
for
both
of
them
we
were
both
just
going
through
a
terrible
time
she
said
now
karri
leyritz
said
the
children
spend
nearly
equal
time
with
each
parent
she
said
they
had
begun
to
settle
into
a
routine
hes
a
great
father
and
thats
really
all
she
said
obviously
we
didnt
get
along
as
husband
and
wife
but
you
have
to
come
to
an
understanding
leyritzs
easygoing
charismatic
demeanor
made
him
popular
on
the
speaking
circuit
last
year
he
received
repeat
requests
to
appear
at
corporate
sales
meetings
little
league
banquets
and
yankees
luxury
suites
engagements
that
his
agent
andrew
levy
said
paid
up
to
7500
each
leyritz
said
he
attended
50
events
in
2007
in
addition
to
working
that
season
as
a
yankees
reporter
for
espn
radio
in
new
york
his
contract
for
2008
was
not
extended
a
decision
that
was
made
before
he
was
arrested
he
was
starting
to
turn
a
corner
said
todd
watson
a
close
friend
he
was
starting
to
become
a
household
name
everything
changed
early
on
dec
28
2007
after
a
night
out
with
friends
to
celebrate
his
birthday
leyritz
ran
a
red
light
about
320
am
and
crashed
into
a
car
driven
by
veitch
who
had
been
drinking
after
finishing
her
shift
as
a
bartender
according
to
authorities
she
was
thrown
from
the
car
and
later
died
an
officer
on
the
scene
described
leyritz
as
having
bloodshot
glassy
eyes
and
a
flushed
face
the
officer
reported
smelling
a
slight
odor
of
alcohol
coming
from
his
breath
as
he
spoke
leyritz
refused
to
submit
to
a
breath
test
and
failed
a
field
sobriety
test
his
blood
alcohol
level
tested
at
610
am
was
014
well
above
floridas
limit
of
008
leyritz
is
also
the
defendant
in
a
civil
case
filed
this
year
by
veitchs
estate
although
he
declined
to
speak
about
the
accident
court
records
show
that
the
defense
will
probably
argue
that
leyritz
cannot
be
entirely
blamed
for
veitchs
death
because
she
was
also
drunk

her
blood
alcohol
level
was
018

and
she
was
not
wearing
a
seat
belt
according
to
the
autopsy
report
i
think
the
evidence
is
so
favorable
on
his
side
that
ultimately
hes
going
to
be
exonerated
of
all
charges
on
the
criminal
case
and
i
think
were
going
to
succeed
in
the
defense
of
the
civil
case
said
jeff
ostrow
a
lawyer
for
leyritz
not
only
was
he
not
negligent
but
she
was
the
direct
and
proximate
cause
of
the
accident
her
lawyer
holds
the
opposite
view
whether
or
not
she
was
intoxicated
is
not
relevant
because
she
was
driving
with
a
green
light
in
her
own
lane
of
traffic
within
the
speed
limit
not
breaking
any
laws
and
she
was
not
in
any
way
the
cause
of
this
accident
pomerantz
said
in
a
deposition
for
the
civil
case
an
eyewitness
karen
rivera
reported
that
leyritz
tried
to
shake
veitchs
leg
after
the
accident
and
asked
if
veitch
had
been
drinking
according
to
a
police
video
taken
on
the
scene
leyritz
told
an
officer
she
hit
me
pretty
good
and
later
did
not
appear
to
react
when
he
was
told
veitch
had
died
friends
say
that
leyritz
was
in
shock
after
the
accident
and
that
his
involvement
in
it

guilty
or
not

has
been
difficult
he
came
and
stayed
with
me
for
the
first
three
days
karri
leyritz
said
it
was
horrendous
i
dont
wish
that
pain
on
my
worst
enemy
believe
me
it
hit
him
in
the
interview
leyritz
declined
to
comment
on
his
feelings
about
the
accident
but
he
did
sometimes
show
frustration
at
those
who
have
avoided
him
since
the
crash
he
said
he
was
not
invited
to
the
allstar
game
in
the
bronx
or
to
the
yankee
stadium
finale
this
year
leyritz
said
that
he
had
a
ticket
to
the
final
game
but
that
he
was
ejected
from
the
vip
area
by
a
security
guard
and
sat
in
the
stands
with
fans
instead
the
yankees
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
am
i
disappointed
that
theres
not
a
little
bit
more
support
there
leyritz
said
i
would
say
a
little
bit
but
at
the
same
time
i
really
truly
understand
the
reasonings
watson
said
his
friend
deserved
better
hes
not
a
leper
and
hes
innocent
watson
said
youre
guilty
until
youre
proven
innocent
in
this
country
unfortunately
leyritz
said
the
yankees
were
not
alone
in
snubbing
him
if
it
was
just
them
doing
it
i
would
say
yeah
he
said
but
you
know
what
its
everything
in
the
year
since
the
accident
leyritz
has
made
unpaid
appearances
at
just
three
events
in
september
he
posed
with
fans
and
signed
autographs
at
suburban
golf
club
in
union
nj
to
benefit
the
local
chamber
of
commerce
bill
liederman
the
event
organizer
said
his
friend
leyritz
was
still
a
yankees
hero
this
is
a
country
of
second
chances
said
liederman
the
former
owner
of
mickey
mantles
restaurant
in
manhattan
there
is
no
yankee
fan
alive
who
doesnt
think
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
trial
that
he
deserves
one
levy
leyritzs
agent
said
that
since
the
accident
corporate
event
organizers
have
asked
to
book
leyritz
only
to
say
a
few
hours
later
that
its
just
not
going
to
work
out
for
us
right
now
levy
did
not
have
to
ask
why
they
canceled
i
knew
the
reason
he
said
for
now
leyritz
continues
to
depend
on
payments
from
the
baseball
assistance
team
and
he
hopes
that
if
he
is
exonerated
the
work
will
return
the
charity
is
not
paying
his
legal
bills
he
said
just
basic
living
expenses
things
so
i
am
able
to
put
a
roof
over
my
kids
head
and
food
on
the
table
he
said
private
equity
firms
embarked
on
one
of
the
biggest
spending
sprees
in
corporate
history
for
nearly
three
years
using
borrowed
money
to
gobble
up
huge
swaths
of
industries
and
some
of
the
biggest
names

neiman
marcus
metrogoldwynmayer
and
toys
r
us
among
them
the
new
owners
then
saddled
the
companies
with
the
billions
of
dollars
of
debt
used
to
buy
them
but
now
many
of
the
loans
and
bonds
sold
to
finance
the
deals
are
about
to
come
due
at
the
worst
possible
time
like
homeowners
with
an
adjustable
rate
mortgage
that
just
went
up
some
of
private
equitys
titans
are
facing
a
huge
squeeze
and
that
is
coming
at
the
same
time
as
consumers
are
staying
home
with
their
wallets
closed
already
this
year
big
retailers
backed
by
private
equity
like
linens
n
things
mervyns
and
steve
ampamp
barrys
have
filed
for
bankruptcy
and
analysts
expect
an
even
broader
array
of
companies
backed
by
private
equity

including
resorts
like
harrahs
entertainment
and
lenders
like
gmac
the
financing
arm
of
general
motors

to
face
even
more
pressure
as
profits
shrivel
and
creditors
come
knocking
theres
absolutely
going
to
a
lot
of
pain
to
go
around
said
josh
lerner
a
professor
of
investment
banking
at
harvard
business
school
who
wrote
a
seminal
paper
on
private
equity
the
big
question
is
how
apocalyptic
it
will
be
private
equity
firms
which
are
lightly
regulated
use
investors
money
to
buy
undervalued
public
companies
and
take
them
private
the
shakeout
could
have
enormous
implications
for
the
economy
people
who
work
for
companies
owned
by
private
equity
firms
could
lose
their
jobs
as
firms
cut
costs
to
meet
their
debt
obligations
and
private
equity
firms
like
apollo
management
which
owns
harrahs
and
linens
n
things
face
deep
markdowns
on
the
value
of
their
holdings
pension
funds
and
college
endowments
that
invested
in
these
funds
in
recent
years
hoping
for
big
returns
are
likely
to
suffer
as
well
and
many
of
those
investors
could
face
a
cash
squeeze
because
they
are
probably
going
to
have
to
hold
onto
their
investments
for
years
until
the
economy
turns
around
the
dangling
other
shoe
is
now
about
to
drop
said
jeffrey
a
sonnenfeld
senior
associate
dean
of
the
yale
school
of
management
when
the
economy
was
booming
the
firms
made
huge
profits
by
cutting
costs
at
their
new
acquisitions
improving
operations
and
then
turning
around
and
selling
them
in
2007
at
the
height
of
the
bubble
such
deals
totaled
796
billion
or
more
than
16
percent
of
the
483
trillion
in
all
the
deals
made
globally
that
year
according
to
data
from
dealogic
firms
like
blackstone
group
and
kohlberg
kravis
roberts
ampamp
co
which
faced
an
image
problem
at
the
height
of
the
bubble
for
excessive
compensation
and
beneficial
tax
treatment
but
their
returns
were
so
high
that
even
investors
like
pension
funds
were
drawn
in
now
these
firms
built
on
enormous
amounts
of
debt
are
being
forced
to
go
back
to
the
financial
markets
just
as
those
markets
have
nearly
frozen
up
if
history
is
any
guide
the
worst
may
be
yet
to
come
steven
n
kaplan
a
professor
at
university
of
chicago
graduate
school
of
business
found
that
nearly
30
percent
of
all
big
publictoprivate
deals
made
from
1986
to
1989
defaulted
afterward
private
equity
players
were
called
in
front
of
congress
and
movies
like
wall
street
and
other
peoples
money
were
made
depicting
financiers
as
greedy
criminals
to
be
sure
many
companies
that
were
not
purchased
by
private
equity
firms
are
also
struggling
circuit
city
the
longtime
seller
of
consumer
electronics
is
trying
to
stave
off
a
bankruptcy
filing
and
publicly
traded
automakers
like
gm
are
troubled
too
gm
wants
to
merge
with
the
struggling
chrysler
which
is
owned
by
private
equity
many
industry
insiders
and
analysts
contend
that
private
equitybacked
companies
will
not
suffer
nearly
as
much
as
those
in
the
late
1980s
because
the
firms
pushed
for
better
financing
conditions
that
allow
them
to
keep
operating
even
if
they
cannot
make
their
debt
payments
for
example
in
an
effort
to
save
cash
six
of
apollos
portfolio
companies
including
claires
stores
harrahs
and
realogy
have
announced
this
year
that
they
will
pay
some
of
their
bonds
interest
payments
by
issuing
more
debt
kaplan
said
he
believed
that
while
it
isnt
going
to
be
pretty
todays
deals
are
much
less
fragile
and
used
less
leverage
he
contended
that
on
a
relative
basis
to
investment
banks
and
hedge
funds
private
equity
may
be
in
a
better
place
because
of
its
longterm
focus
stephen
a
schwarzman
chairman
of
blackstone
group
remains
committed
to
the
future
of
private
equity
the
people
rooting
for
the
collapse
of
private
equity
are
going
to
be
disappointed
he
said
while
some
companies
may
find
themselves
in
trouble
he
said
many
more
will
be
able
to
ride
out
a
downturn
in
the
economy
because
of
the
lax
financing
conditions
that
banks
agreed
to
at
the
top
of
the
market
he
added
that
he
believes
that
now
may
be
the
best
time
for
private
equity
because
of
the
investment
opportunities
amid
the
crisis
historically
downturns
are
when
the
most
money
gets
made
he
said
shares
of
blackstone
are
hovering
at
around
10
down
from
the
31
they
were
at
when
blackstone
went
public

2007

in

2007
lerner
of
the
harvard
business
school
said
that
trouble
among
private
equity
firms
would
probably
precipitate
hard
questions
about
the
compensation
and
fee
structure
in
the
industry
the
firms
generally
take
fees
of
2
percent
of
all
money
managed
and
20
percent
of
profits
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
they
try
to
head
of
the
criticism
by
returning
capital
he
said
the
problem
for
recent
deals
is
that
many
firms
waded
into
economically
sensitive
sectors
like
retailing
and
restaurants
firms
like
apollo
cerberus
capital
management
and
sun
capital
partners
purchased
several
troubled
companies
to
turn
around
from
2004
through
the
first
half
of
2007
in
the
case
of
linens
n
things
a
longtime
alsoran

ampamp
beyond
apollo
knew
that
it
had
a
tough
job
ahead
of
it
yet
it
still
added
lots
of

two
months
before
linens
n
things
was
acquired
it
reported
21
million
in
longterm
debt
by
dec
31
2007
that
amount
had
exploded
to
855
million
at
the
time
private
equity
firms
assumed
that
they
could
refinance
their
portfolio
companies
debt
cheaply
but
many
appear
to
have
been
blindsided
by
the
size
and
severity
of
the
credit
market
meltdown
which
has
left
lenders
unable
or
unwilling
to
loan
out
more
money
in
what
seems
a
worrisome
trend
many
bonds
of
private
equitybacked
companies
have
recently
plummeted
in
value
signaling
worries
about
their
solvency
these
include

that

harrahs

was
saddled
with
a

of

when
it
was
taken
private

before
the
closing

that

swollen
to

already

unfortunately

analysts
from

about

republican
presidential
opponent

democratic
nominees
have
averaged

percent
of
the
white
vote
in

news
poll
obama
drew
44
percent
support
among
whites

a
higher
proportion
than
bill
clinton
captured
in
his
general
election
victories
analysts
ascribe
that
success
to
changing
racial
attitudes
obamas
deftness
republican
missteps
and
the
economic
crisis
whatever
the
cause
when
combined
with
his
twotoone
edge
among
hispanics
and
his
10to1
edge
among
blacks
it
has
given
him
a
national
electioneve
lead
the
race
is
not
over
and
election
day
could
bring
surprises
and
mccain
is
capturing
a
majority
of
the
white
vote
according
to
these
same
polls
yet
population
shifts
have
made
racial
and
ethnic
diversity
an
unavoidable
fact
of
american
life
when
ronald
reagan
won
reelection
in
1984
whites
made
up
86
percent
of
the
electorate
by
2004
they
had
dropped
to
77
percent
with
that
backdrop
some
observers
say
racial
attitudes
have
diminished
as
an
independent
force
fading
into
the
broader
fabric
of
cultural
concerns
that
shape
voters
choices
like
religion
abortion
and
gun
control
anybody
who
votes
against
barack
obama
because
of
the
color
of
his
skin
the
republicans
would
have
gotten
on
another
cultural
issue
said
david
saunders
a
consultant
in
virginia
who
advises
democratic
candidates
on
attracting
white
rural
and
workingclass
voters
the
presidential
historian
michael
beschloss
credits
obama
with
reprising
the
approach
adopted
by
john
f
kennedy
in
his
1960
breakthrough
as
the
first
roman
catholic
to
win
the
presidency
he
was
running
to
be
president
of
all
the
people
not
president
of
a
faction
beschloss
said

obamas
success
in
making
that
case
asked
whether
an
obama
presidency
would
favor
the
interests
of
blacks
over
other
americans
eight
in
10
whites
said
it
would
not
for
democratic
strategists
who
have
spent
their
careers
laboring
to
regain
white
voters
allegiance
that
alone
is
a
striking
achievement
in
the
mid1980s
research
by
the
pollster
stan
greenberg
in
macomb
county
mich
concluded
that
middleclass
whites
resented
the
raw
deal
they
received
from
a
political
debate
in
which
democrats
appeared
focused
on
racial
minorities
and
the
poor
like
greenbergs
client
bill
clinton
in
1992
obama
has
emphasized
broadgauged
assistance
for
the
middle
class
hes
managed
to
campaign
in
ways
that
may
not
have
changed
their
world
view
but
have
allowed
them
to
put
those
feelings
aside
greenberg
said
he
added
with
a
note
of
bemusement
maybe
he
has
crossed
over
into
tiger
woods
territory
frustrated
republicans
see
obamas
steady
performances
on
the
stump
and
in
debates
as
only
part
of
the
explanation
for
his
surprising
level
of
white
support
just
as
responsible
some
argue
is
that
president
bushs
unpopularity
in
threatening
economic
times
has
veered
close
to
herbert
hoover
territory
youve
got
to
give
obama
an
awful
lot
of
credit
for
his
likeability
said
tom
slade
a
former
florida
republican
party
chairman
who
abandoned
his
own
democratic
allegiance
in
1964
in
the
early
phase
of
white
conservatives
political
migration
more
important
he
said
we
have
done
a
miserable
job
of
managing
the
affairs
of
government
in
the
early
1990s
the
political
reporter
peter
brown
wrote
minority
party
a
book
exploring
the
pitfalls
of
the
democrats
identification
with
the
interests
of
africanamericans
he
credited
obama
with
providing
a
comfort
zone
for
white
voters
but
pointed
to
the
major
boost
he
received
this
fall
from
the
financial
crisis
on
the
watch
of
a
republican
president
the
most
important
color
is
green
said
brown
now
assistant
director
of
the
quinnipiac
university
polling
institute
when
lehman
bros
went
under
this
thing
changed
dramatically
people
are
just
terrified
about
their
financial
futures
in
the
spring
some
democratic
strategists
feared
obama
might
be
crippled
in
states
where
he
lost
workingclass
white
primary
voters
decisively
to
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
in
ohio
carried
by
bush
in
2000
and
2004
polls
now
show
obama
is
competitive
in
pennsylvania
a
top
target
for
mccain
he
is
ahead
in
the
polls
with
a
message
muting
racial
concerns
obama
didnt
begin
his
presidential
bid
with
overwhelming
strength
among
blacks
that
came
only
after
he
defeated
clinton
in
the
whitedominated
iowa
caucuses
ironically
the
biggest
difficulty
about
race
for
obama
was
the
doubts
among
africanamericans
about
his
ability
to
succeed
in
the
nominating
process
said
tad
devine
a
top
strategist
for
al
gore
in
2000
and
john
kerry
in
2004
its
amazing
to
me

almost
unreal
said
rep
john
lewis
dga
earlier
this
fall
lewis
a
civil
rights
movement
veteran
accused
mccains
campaign
of
sowing
the
seeds
of
hatred
in
a
way
that
was
reminiscent
of
george
wallace
during
the
1960s
an
attack
that
mccain
called
brazen
and
baseless
and
that
obama
distanced
himself
from
more
recently
lewis
added
the
campaign
has
made
him
sort
of
sad
since
leaders
of
that
movement
including
the
rev
dr
martin
luther
king
jr
and
president
johnson
cannot
witness
obamas
candidacy
on
deck

we
are
running
out
of
decks
this
is
the
last
day
before
election
day
and
the
daily
countdown
ends

for
the
candidates
now
it
is
all
about
turnout
and
getting
out
base
voters
there
arent
many

while
sen
barack
obama
is

appropriately
aggressive
finale

his
campaign

and
we
are
getting

to
bid
goodbye
to
what
has
been
the
most
compelling

we

john

a
proudly

man
spent
sunday
holding
the
final
town
hall
of
his
campaign
a
tribute
to
the
forum
he
has
become
so
identified
with
during
his
two
runs
for
president
and
mccain
did
it
in
new
hampshire
which
delivered
primary
victories
for
him
in
2000
and
2008
though
this
state
went
democratic
in
2004
he
is
hoping
that
it
will
support
him
on
tuesday
my

he
said
the

barack

perhaps
not

you
would
find
nothing

respect

let
it
not

that

in

stretch
the
tongue
stumbles
when
you
speak
thousands
upon
thousands
of
words
in
public
each
day
some
of
them
are
bound
to
come
out
a
bit
twisted
from
time
to
time

especially
during
the
grueling
sleepless
whatstatearewein
final
days
of
a
presidential
campaign
most
of
the
time
they
are
not
so
much
gaffes
as
odd
verbal
hiccups
so
there
was
sen
john
mccain
the
republican
presidential
nominee
on
sunday
in
wallingford
pa
offering
up
a
novel
description
of
supplyside
economics
with
his
observation
that
keeping
taxes
low
creates
jobs
keeps
money
in
your
pants
and
strengthens
our
economy
and
sen
joseph
r
biden
jr
in
melbourne
fla
on
tuesday
mangling
the
name
of
the
republican
vicepresidential
nominee
as
sarah
mccain
and
making
each
day
seem
extraordinarily
long
when
he
said
there
were
seven
more
weeks
until
the
election
time

often
an
elastic
concept
on
the
trail

also
tripped
up
his
republican
counterpart
gov
sarah
palin
who
may
be
hoping
that
none
of
her
supporters
in
canton
ohio
wait
until
wednesday
to
vote
on
a
campaign
stop
there
sunday
palin
told
them
now
with
just
three
days
from
the
election
the
time
for
choosing
is
near
two
hours
later
in
marietta
she
corrected
herself
we
are
just
two
days
away
from
the
election
and
sen
barack
obama
the
democratic
presidential
nominee
mixed
up
his
fictional
dogooders
sunday
in
columbus
ohio
as
he
reached
for
a
new
simile
to
make
his
argument
that
mccain
has
been
a
sidekick
to
president
bush
he
is
like
kato
to
the
green
lantern
he
said
you
all
remember
that
those
of
you
over
a
certain
age
if
the
remark
drew
little
crowd
reaction
perhaps
it
was
because
obama
had
the
wrong
green
guy
he
apparently
meant
to
say
green
hornet
to
whom
kato
memorably
played
by
bruce
lee

the

parsley
was
one
of
the
more
prominent
evangelicals
to
hail
mccain
as
a
strong
true
consistent
conservative
but
two
days
before
the
election
in
a
state
central
to
mccains
hopes
parsley
preached
to
his
vast

at

and
circling
in
on
a
fight
with
the
eternal
forces
of
darkness
without
ever
mentioning
mccain
in
part
parsleys
choice
could
reflect
the
vagaries
of
presidential
politics
mccain
was
forced
to
disavow
him
last
spring
after
church
tapes
revealed
that
parsley
had
repeatedly
claimed
that
america
was
founded
in
part
to
destroy
the
false
religion
of
islam
still
some
who
have
studied
the
evangelical
movement
see
signs
of
splintering
as
younger
evangelicals
begin
to
assert
their
own
political
identity
and
obama
has
courted
them
with
great
ardor
you
are
starting
to
see
some
fragmentation
it
could
be
that
the
days
of
a
monolithic
bloc
of
evangelicals
are
over
said

director
of
the
center
for

school
the

are

and
they
are
questioning

not

in
a

of
the

black
churches
all

openly
endorsed

like
the
rev

first
congregational

united
church
of
christ
in
columbus
showered
praise
on
obama
without
handing
down
an
endorsement
last
sunday
ahrens
noted
in
his
sermon
what
excites
me
today
about
the
historic
race
of
barack
obama
is
that
we
have
reached
the
place
in
our
countrys
history
that
a
biracial
leader
can
ascend
to
the
office
of
president
whether
he
wins
or
loses
this
candidacy
is
remarkable

for
the
last

the
classics
of
bruce
springsteen
have
played
at

the
soundtrack
to
yet
another
campaign
so
when
springsteen
came
to
the
cleveland
mall
on
sunday
to
perform
in
person
a
crowd
spilled
into
lakeside
avenue
and
the

obama
may
have
been
the
nights
headliner
but
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
boss
he
sang
a
series
of
hits
then
gave
his
own

talk
today
we
are
at

crossroads
its
been

long
long
time
coming

said

country
back
i

my

back
i

back
now
is
the
time
to
stand
with
barack

roll
up
our
sleeves
and
come
on
up
for
the
rising
with
that
springsteen
went
into
the
song
that
introduces
obama
at
every
rally
but
a
few
minutes
after
obama
took
the
stage
a
pleasant
day
faded
and
the
skies
opened
into
a
downpour
weve
been
through
an
eightyear
storm
obama
said
sunshine
is
on
the
way
he
added
weve
just
got
two
more
days
of
these
clouds
some
did
not
want
to
wait
as
obama
delivered
his
stump
speech
going
slightly
longer
than
30
minutes
the
crowd
which
the
police
estimated
at
60000
began
to
dissipate
obama
did
not
seem
deterred
largely
because
he
was
joined
by
his
wife
and
two
daughters
for
the
final
weekend
of
campaigning
when
theyre
with
you
on
the
road
boy
everything
looks
a

better
obama
said
the
crowds
seem
to
grow
and

got

end
gomes
said
via
an
interpreter
in
the
marathon
you
know
you
have
won
the
race
when
you
cross
the
finish
line
not
before
with
less
than
a
mile
to
go
those
missed
drink
stops
might
have
taken
their
toll
on
goumri
he
stiffened
and
faltered
as
gomes
surged
into
a
new
gear
he
passed
goumri
and
won
his
second
new
york
city
marathon
in
2
hours
8
minutes
43
seconds
goumri
finished
24
seconds
later
disappointed
and
spent
a
repeat
of
his
secondplace
finish
a
year
ago
when
martin
lel
of
kenya
outsprinted
him
at
the
end
after
i
pass
marilson
and
i
think
i
had
almost
10
seconds
15
seconds
i
said
its
my
day
goumri
said
but
its
finishing
a
marathon
i
turned
back
and
saw
marilson
come
back
i
said
i
think
he
is
going
to
win
today
goumri
now
with
three
secondplace
finishes
in
major
marathons
vowed
to
return
i
hope
i
can
come
back
one
day
and
i
should
win
one
day
no
problem
he
said
daniel
rono
of
kenya
finished
third
in
21122
for
gomes
31
the
finish
brought
back
a
rush
of
memories
when
he
won
here
in
2006
he
was
almost
unknown
outside
of
brazil
and
it
was
part
of
the
reason
he
won
when
he
surged
ahead
of
the
pack
on
first
avenue
in
manhattan
with
more
than
six
miles
to
go
in
the
race
none
of
the
top
contenders
followed
him
paul
tergat
the
former
marathon
worldrecord
holder
from
kenya
who
was
fourth
on
sunday
later
said
that
he
had
no
idea
who
gomes
was
gomes
cruised
to
that
finish
relatively
unchallenged
and
the
marathon
world

including
the
television
broadcasters

scrambled
to
find
out
just
who
had
so
unexpectedly
swiped
the
title
that
race
vaulted
gomes
into
the
realm
of
the
sports
stars
back
in
brazil
a
country
usually
fixated
on
its
soccer
stars
gomes
became
an
unlikely
hero
a
parade
greeted
his
return
without
a
doubt
to
win
a
great
event
like
new
york
is
great
for
anybody
gomes
said
i
am
very
well
known
in
brazil
everybody
recognizes
me
the
young
kids
running
now
they
look
up
to
me
theres
a
lot
of
new
running
groups
in
brazil
and
the
people
recognize
who
i
am
and
what
i
did
gomes
has
not
been
able
to
come
close
to
that
result
since
he
ran
the
london
and
new
york
marathons
last
year
and
finished
eighth
in
each
he
could
not
finish
the
olympic
marathon
in
beijing
blaming
the
heat
and
humidity
meanwhile
goumri
32
was
taking
the
marathon
world
by
storm
he
finished
second
in
his
debut
the
london
marathon
in
2007
when
lel
outkicked
him
at
the
end
to
win
by
three
seconds
in
new
york
later
in
the
year
lel
again
pulled
away
in
the
final
halfmile
to
beat
goumri
by
12
seconds
goumri
also
had
high
hopes
in
the
olympics
but
after
running
strong
early
faded
and
finished
20th
here
he
thought
he
had
put
all
of
that
behind
him
he
called
missing
his
drink
stations
a
costly
mistake
he
said
he
was
concentrating
on
the
race
several
times
he
could
not
spot
his
bottle
on
the
tables
if
your
sugar
is
down
you
will
have
a
problem
in
the
last
mile
he
said
i
missed
about
three
or
four
if
i
did
not
miss
them
i
think
i
am
strong
i
would
win
today
goumri
made
the
move
that
shook
up
the
race
at
the
halfway
mark
with
an
unusually
large
lead
pack
of
about
20
runners
goumri
decided
to
surge
ahead
the
burst
immediately
splintered
the
pack
and
formed
a
new
lead
pack
of
about
eight
at
that
point
abdi
abdirahman
had
high
hopes
of
contending
for
the
title
he
was
considered
the
top
contender
to
break
the
26year
american
victory
drought
abdirahman
led
for
much
of
the
first
10
miles
but
when
goumri
made
his
move
abdirahman
felt
a
stitch
in
his
side
he
watched
the
leaders
go
and
could
not
follow
by
the
time
he
felt
better
it
was
mile
17
and
he
could
not
catch
up
he
moved
up
from
there
and
finished
sixth
the
top
american
finisher
in
21417
behind
him
three
other
americans

josh
rohatinsky
jason
lehmkuhle
and
bolota
asmerom

finished
in
the
top
10
the
most
since
1987
i
thought
i
had
a
chance
of
winning
if
i
would
have
felt
better
abdirahman
said
if
i
didnt
have
a
problem
with
my
side
stitch
i
would
have
done
much
better
than
i
did
i
think
i
would
have
been
up
there
on
the
podium
the
man
at
the
top
of
the
podium
was
not
such
a
surprise
this
time
around
gomes
said
he
trained
specifically
to
handle
the
hills
of
the
new
york
course
and
even
though
he
is
accustomed
to
heat
back
home
the
cold
and
wind
here
does
not
bother
him
he
ran
most
of
the
race
wearing
a
knit
cap
at
the
end
he
warmed
himself
with
a
wide
smile
and
was
greeted
by
welcoming
cheers
people
in
new
york
as
well
as
brazil
know
him
now
gomes
said
he
expected
another
heros
welcome
back
in
brazil
probably
there
will
be
a
parade
and
a
celebration
he
said
but
its
going
to
have
to
wait
a
bit
because
im
planning
on
going
on
vacation
with
my
wife
to
disney
world
gomes
laughed
brazil
he
figures
will
soon
laugh
with
him
again
for
elite
runners
marathons
are
not
unlike
bank
accounts
only
so
many
withdrawals
can
be
made
before
the
body
exceeds
the
available
balance
of
miles
and
speed
and
stamina
at
34
battling
recent
stress
fractures
and
two
olympic
disappointments
paula
radcliffe
of
britain
had
come
to
a
moment
of
accounting
on
sunday

a
victory
at
the
new
york
city
marathon
would
signal
that
her
career
remained
encouragingly
solvent
at
the
top
international
level
while
defeat
might
indicate
that
her
legs
had
reached
the
overdraft
of
inevitable
decline
on
a
windy
cold
morning
radcliffe
ran
a
pitiless
race
leading
from
beginning
to
end
over
262
miles
hammering
the
pace
shedding
the
rest
of
the
field
with
four
miles
remaining
and
winning
in
new
york
for
the
third
time
in
2
hours
23
minutes
56
seconds
radcliffe
won
so
thoroughly
that
she
finished
almost
two
minutes
ahead
of
the
next
runner
and
completed
the
second
half
of
the
race
nearly
three
minutes
faster
than
the
first
half
she
did
not
approach
her
world
record
of
21525
but
that
was
not
the
point
while
running
into
the
hills
and
into
a
headwind
victory
in
new
york
is
always
more
important
than
time
the
victory
will
give
radcliffe
leverage
when
her
nike
contract
comes
up
for
renewal
in
january
and
will
let
the
rest
of
the
worlds
top
marathoners
know
that
she
is
serious
in
her
ambition
of
challenging
for
a
gold
medal
at
the
2012
london
olympics
by
then
she
will
be
38
the
same
age
as
the
2008
olympic
champion
constantina
tomescudita
of
romania
im
sure
she
can
do
it
tomescudita
a
spectator
on
sunday
said
she
was
so
strong
today
from
beginning
to
end
ludmila
petrova
of
russia
the
2000
new
york
champion
took
second
at
age
40
in

set

record
for
a

runner
kara

was
the
best
by
an
american
woman
in

since
anne
marie

took
third
in
1994
beyond
sundays
start
radcliffe
knifed
into
the
lead
on
the
humpbacked
first
mile
along
the
verrazanonarrows
bridge
with
the
temperature
at
41
degrees
and
a
northeast
wind
blowing
at
15
miles
an
hour
that
is
her
style
assertive
unwavering
no
patience
for
letting
others
set
the
pace
dressed
in
a
purple
singlet
with
only
a
pair
of
white
gloves
to
protect
against
the
chilly
headwind
radcliffe
ran
with
her
familiar
nodding
style
she
served
as
a
windbreak
for
the
lead
pack
petrova
goucher
and
the
other
challengers
tucked
in
behind
it
was
tough
out
there
because
of
the
wind
radcliffe
said
everyone
seemed
to
want
to
run
behind
me
less
than
three
months
ago
at
the
beijing
olympics
radcliffe
stopped
during
the
race
to
stretch
her
aching
cramping
legs
and
finished
a
distressed
23rd
she
had
been
unable
to
train
sufficiently
after
a
stress
fracture
in
her
left
femur
in
may
this
had
come
after
the
huge
disappointment
at
the
2004
athens
games
where
radcliffe
did
not
finish
in
the
oppressive
heat
and
humidity
she
had
no
such
vulnerability
on
sunday
after
reaching
the
halfway
point
in
11323
in
a
pack
of
five
runners
radcliffe
began
to
escalate
the
pace
wearing
black
sleeves
to
warm
her
arms
goucher
30
seemed
comfortable
running
in
radcliffes
slipstream
at
least
for
a
time
her
return
home
for
her
marathon
debut
bore
a
sense
of
the
bittersweet
goucher
is
a
native
of
queens
but
she
moved
to
the
midwest
at
age
4
after
her
father
was
killed
by
a
drunken
driver
on
the
harlem
river
drive
she
won
a
bronze
medal
in
the
10000
at
the
2007
world
track
and
field
championships
and
competed
in
the
5000
and
the
10000
at
the
beijing
games
which
left
goucher
entering
sundays
marathon
with
ebullient
hopes
but
hope
is
not
the
same
as
experience
on
first
avenue
radcliffe
covered
mile
17
in
516
one
moment
goucher
appeared
relaxed
the
next
she
was
in
trouble
then
she
fell
away
as
others
had
before
her
including
catherine
ndereba
the
2008
olympic
silver
medalist
and
gete
wami
the
2007
new
york
runnerup
who
lost
a
chance
to
win
a
500000
bonus
as
part
of
the
world
marathon
majors
competition
a
year
ago
radcliffe
did
not
subdue
wami
until
the
final
mile
the
suspense
ended
much
earlier
sunday
radcliffe
began
to
bob
her
head
more
noticeably
as
she
always
does
a
tic
that
seems
to
signify
her
exertion
and
determination
by
mile
20
only
petrova
was
left
to
challenge
her
radcliffe
did
not
look
back
fearful
of
stepping
in
a
pothole
and
of
violating
her
fathers
assertion
that
peering
at
other
runners
is
a
sign
of
weakness
mercilessly
radcliffe
put
her
foot
heavily
on
the
accelerator
she
ran
mile
21
in
518
and
mile
22
in
512
striding
easily
and
boldly
while
petrova
shuffled
desperately
behind
fading
trying
to
hold
off
a
renewed
goucher
for
second
place
first
place
had
been
long
decided
though
victory
in
new
york
only
highlighted
radcliffes
failures
at
the
athens
and
beijing
olympics
it
does
make
it
frustrating
she
said
you
think
why
can
i
get
it
right
in
new
york
and
i
cant
get
it
right
there
others
have
begun
to
suggest
to
radcliffe
that
she
reduce
her
training
or
her
racing
in
an
effort
to
preserve
whatever
greatness
remains
in
her
legs
so
far
she
has
resisted
the
advice
sunday
demonstrated
why
there
is
a
finite
number
of
good
marathons
in
anyone
radcliffe
said
but
i
do
believe
that
number
varies
from
person
to
person
you
never
know
until
you
are
kind
of
on
the
downside
that
you
are
so
im
grateful
for
each
one
and
hope
its
going
to
hold
being
a
reserve
quarterback
in
the
nfl
is
not
all
that
dissimilar
to
the
role
of
vice
president
brooks
bollinger
explained
after
serving
the
cowboys
on
sunday
as
backup
to
a
backup
i
was
trying
to
get
prepared
knowing
im
just
a
snap
away
bollinger
the
onetime
jet
said
of
awaiting
an
opportunity
that
came
in
the
second
half
while
watching
brad
johnson
throw
his
away
in
the
first
by
the
end
of
a
3514
giants
victory
all
you
could
say
was
that
jerry
jones
could
have
played
quarterback
for
the
cowboys
fulfilled
a
zealous
owners
fantasy
and
who
would
have
known
the
difference
from
johnson
and
bollinger
these
were
the
impotent
standins
for
tony
romo
in
as
unsightly
a
giantscowboys
game
as
it
gets
won
by
the
home
side
in
bruising
cruising
fashion
largely
because
dallas
was
utterly
helpless
on
offense
isnt
it
amazing
when
a
team
with
super
bowl
hopes

which
these
cowboys
certainly
had
but
have
already
downgraded
to
wildcard
prayers

embarks
on
its
journey
without
a
competent
quarterback
on
the
bench
because
what
are
the
chances
of
an
injury
within
the
airtight
security
chamber
in
which
the
quarterback
typically
plays
its
not
all
the
quarterbacks
obviously
wade
phillips
the
cowboys
coach
said
after
americas
team
plunged
into
the
basement
of
the
national
football
conferences
east
division
phillips
did
concede
that
a
13
record
without
romo
and
going
from
the
thirdbest
offense
in
the
league
to
whatever
weve
been
the
past
few
games

in
a
word
bad

was
no
endorsement
for
how
the
cowboys
planned
for
the
season
johnson
40
and
no
vinny
testaverde
was
intercepted
twice
in
the
first
half
by
cornerback
corey
webster
and
both
resulted
in
giants
touchdowns
bollinger
relieved
johnson
to
start
the
third
quarter
but
his
first
pass
went
straight
to
no
37
in
blue
giants
safety
james
butler
two
play
later
brandon
jacobs
was
in
the
end
zone
with
the
giants
fourth
touchdown
and
a
287
lead
the
rest
of
the
game
had
all
the
tension
of
an
august
exhibition
romo
and
his
injured
pinkie
could
be
two
weeks
from
returning
and
because
the
cowboys
54
do
not
play
next
week
they
naturally
were
in
no
mood
to
concede
anything
least
of
all
their
season
the
problem
is
they
werent
all
that
intimidating
before
romo
was
injured
they
have
other
issues
besides
injuries
they
are
in
a
fiercely
competitive
division
with
a
difficult
schedule
and
they
have
a
coach
phillips
who
could
conceivably
be
going
byebye
during
the
break
depending
on
how
irritated
jones
was
watching
his
team
take
such
a
giants
stadium
beating
i
dont
think
well
fall
apart
by
any
means

this
will
be
a
test
of
character
a
test
of
will
terrell
owens
said
suddenly
a
coolheaded
leader
which
is
good
news
for
the
cowboys
given
the
potential
alternative
but
bad
news
if
thats
what
it
has
come
to
for
a
team
that
might
be
ready
to
implode
if
the
giants
taught
us
anything
last
season
when
they
transformed
themselves
from
dysfunctional
family
to
kumbaya
kings
of
the
road
it
is
that
team
character
is
a
quality
that
cannot
be
created
with
the
addition
of
bigname
players
it
develops
over
time
and
with
commitment
and
purpose
maybe
jones
should
have
been
looking
for
a
legitimate
standin
for
romo
instead
of
working
so
hard
to
elevate
the
cowboys
rogue
and
knucklehead
quotient
with
his
illfated
pursuit
of
the
nowsuspended
cornerback
adam
jones
in
case
he
hasnt
noticed
backup
quarterbacks
are
a
crucial
commodity

most
notably
in
tennessee
where
the
former
giants
super
bowler
kerry
collins
who
began
the
season
behind
vince
young
is
at
the
helm
of
the
leagues
last
undefeated
team
actually
it
took
tom
coughlin
and
the
giants
awhile
to
grasp
this
medical
math
too
remember
when
the
unaccomplished
jared
lorenzen
with
his
charles
barkley
body
type
was
one
snap
away
from
eli
mannings
position
this
season
david
carr
a
former
starter
who
is
in
the
prime
of
his
athletic
life
provides
a
major
upgrade
for
his
part
manning
continued
to
rise
sunday
with
three
touchdown
passes
despite
an
appearance
of
early
eli
in
the
first
half
on
successive
possessions
he
fumbled
while
attempting

plays
later

at

line
then
manning
was
intercepted
by
cornerback
mike
jenkins
who
returned
the
pass
23
yards
to
the
end
zone
the
replay
showed
that
mannings
throw
was
to
the
sideline
intended
for
plaxico
burress
who
appeared
to
run
a
straight
route
tom
coughlin
chose
to
blame
neither
and
to
credit
jenkins
good
as
he
is
burress
remains
a
headache
for
the
giants
coach
although
coughlin
is
developing
a
remedy
in
the
person
of
receiver
steve
smith
an
emerging
star
in
an
already
deep
and
versatile
offense
this
is
perhaps
the
most
telling
contrast
the
giants
act
and
play
like
the
selfassured
defending
champions
they
are
the
cowboys
have
the
look
of
a
group
that
has
experienced
resounding
frustration
at
the
end
of
their
last
two
seasons
and
can
sense
another
slipping
away
its
not
over

gov
jim
gibbons
of
nevada
has
been
cleared
by
the
justice
department
of
any
wrongdoing
in
connection
with
an
inquiry
into
whether
he
helped
a
friend
win
defense
contracts
in
exchange
for
gifts
gibbons
lawyer
said
the
lawyer
abbe
d
lowell
said
the
lead
prosecutor
in
the
case
informed
gibbons
on
friday
that
no
charges
would
be
filed
and
that
the
investigation
related
to
gibbons
work
as
a
congressman
before
he
was
elected
governor
in
2006
had
been
closed
a
justice
department
spokeswoman
laura
sweeney
said
the
department
would
not
comment
lowell
said
gibbons
a
republican
whose
first
term
as
governor
has
been
dogged
by
legal
political
and
personal
troubles
would
make
a
statement
on
monday
the
investigation
spanned
18
months
lowell
said
and
began
when
a
former
staff
member
of
a
technology
company
run
by
a
friend
of
the
governor
made
accusations
of
influence
peddling
the
former
staff
member
dennis
montgomery
told
news
media
outlets
that
his
boss
warren
trepp
the
owner
of
etreppid
technologies
had
given
gibbons
money
casino
chips
and
a
caribbean
cruise
to
help
etreppid
win
defense
department
contracts
lowell
called
the
accusations
ridiculous
and
hogwash
and
said
the
governor
does
not
even
gamble
lowell
said
gibbons
had
cooperated
in
the
investigation
and
in
recent
months
had
been
interviewed
by
fbi
agents
the
investigation
lowell
said
might
have
been
slowed
by
a
civil
lawsuit
between
montgomery
and
etreppid
which
was
settled
last
month
blxware
llc
the
company
where
montgomery
works
said
the
terms
of
the
settlement
were
confidential
but
the
company
based
in
bellevue
wash
disclosed
that
the
agreement
included
a
payment
to
trepp
as
compensation
for
certain
allegations
made
against
him
in
the
news
media
the
closing
of
the
investigation
provides
welcome
news
to
gibbons
in
a
trying
period
a
former
cocktail
waitress
filed
a
lawsuit
against
him
last
month
alleging
that
he
pushed
her
and
threatened
to
rape
her
after
a
night
of
drinking
in
las
vegas
just
before
the
november
2006
election
gibbons
denied
the
accusation
and
criminal
charges
were
not
filed
gibbons
63
and
his
wife
dawn
54
began
divorce
proceedings
this
year
after
22
years
of
marriage
the
news
media
in
nevada
have
made
much
of
her
accusation
of
adultery
and
the
disclosure
of
hundreds
of
text
messages
he
sent
to
a
woman
he
has
said
was
a
friend
but
who
dawn
gibbons
lawyers
suggest
was
a
mistress
the
jets
spent
the
first
half
of
their
season
talking
about
what
kind
of
team
they
could
be
talking
about
potential
and
possibility
and
promise
they
knew
as
well
as
anyone
the
way
their
extreme
makeover
of
an
offseason
unfolded
the
palatial
new
team
headquarters
the
trades
for
nose
tackle
kris
jenkins
and
quarterback
brett
favre
the
blank
check
the
owner
woody
johnson
cut
for
general
manager
mike
tannenbaum
all
those
moves
were
made
for
games
like
the
one
the
jets
played
sunday
in
the
division
on
the
road
against
a
bills
squad
that
won
the
teams
previous
three
meetings
the
jets
played
their
most
complete
game
this
season
they
played
like
the
team
they
were
talking
about
all
along
beating
the
bills
2617
in
front
of
71827
fans
most
of
whom
left
ralph
wilson
stadium
dazed
confused
and
muttering
questions
the
home
team
had
no
answer
for
you
bring
people
in
in
hopes
of
what
you
want
to
do
to
take
a
football
team
on
the
road
into
a
hostile
environment
like
this
jets
fullback
tony
richardson
said
you
come
in
here
expecting
to
play
well
knowing
you
can
win
after
their
victory
the
jets
53
walked
off
the
field
without
so
much
as
a
hint
of
celebration
some
shook
hands
with
the
bills
others
stopped
to
pray
near
midfield
all
walked
toward
the
tunnel
without
the
expected
screams
and
without
the
expected
swagger
never
mind
that
they
had
just
recorded
their
most
important
road
victory
since
2006
when
they
beat
the
patriots
in
foxborough
mass
never
mind
that
it
followed
a
month
of
uneven
play
that
had
critics
labeling
the
jets
as
more
pretender
than
contender
never
mind
that
they
had
just
topped
last
seasons
victory
total
in
eight
games
and
never
mind
that
the
win
combined
with
the
patriots
1815
loss
to
the
colts
on
sunday
night
moved
the
jets
into
a
tie
for
first
place
in
the
american
football
conference
east
the
jets
walked
as
if
they
expected
this
they
talked
as
if
they
expected
this
it
was
huge
linebacker
david
bowens
said
good
teams
do
that
they
finish
off
a
game
theyre
able
to
run
the
ball
late
theyre
able
to
make
stops
the
jets
did
all
of
that
on
sunday
their
defense
which
last
forced
a
turnover
on
oct
12
responded
with
three
takeaways
and
five
sacks
their
offense
last
seen
searching
for
its
identity
moved
efficiently
throughout
their
kicker
jay
feely
made
four
field
goals
it
was
our
best
game
as
far
as
everybody
coming
together
and
doing
their
job
linebacker
calvin
pace
said
favre
turned
in
a
game
memorable
for
how
unmemorable
it
was
after
throwing
seven
interceptions
in
the
three
games
that
preceded
this
one
favre
stuck
with
the
jets
offensive
plan
throwing
passes
short
and
safe
mixing
in
the
run
of
the
28
passes
favre
threw
against
the
bills
19
found
the
hands
of
his
receivers
and
most
important
only
one
was
caught
by
a
bills
defender
shedding
his
wild
gunslinging
ways
he
was
a
model
of
efficiency
maybe
he
followed
the
advice
of
coach
eric
mangini
who
using
a
blackjack
analogy
last
week
told
favre
not
to
hit
on
20
mangini
played
down
their
regular
tuesday
meeting

it
wasnt
like
we
had
a
giant
summit
he
said

but
whatever
was
discussed
worked
when
the
jets
needed
an
efficient
drive
to
milk
the
clock
in
the
fourth
quarter
they
turned
not
to
favre
whose
interception
had
just
been
returned
for
a
touchdown
but
to
their
running
game
leading
by
2317
with
10
minutes
47
seconds
remaining
in
the
game
the
jets
followed
their
running
backs
downfield
richardson
the
fullback
was
one
of
the
new
additions
as
were
linemen
alan
faneca
and
damien
woody
by
the
time
feely
kicked
his
fourth
field
goal
the
jets
had
bled
more
than
eight
minutes
off
the
clock
mangini
called
the
drive
critical
the
bills
needed
two
scores
in
about
two
minutes
and
got
none
that
was
the
biggest
part
of
the
acquisitions
we
made
in
the
offseason
tight
end
chris
baker
said
of
the
run
game
it
hasnt
become
our
identity
yet
but
it
should
be
with
the
guys
we
brought
in
and
the
guys
we
have
to
run
the
ball
the
jets
revival
on
offense
was
accompanied
by
one
on
defense
in
their
previous
three
games
the
jets
struggled
to
stop
the
lackluster
offenses
of
the
bengals
raiders
and
chiefs
not
here
against
the
bills
not
after
allowing
a
touchdown
on
the
bills
first
drive
cornerback

revis
in

middle
of

season
blitzed

quarterback
trent
edwards
from
his
blind
side
edwards
never
saw
revis
coming
and
revis
stripped
the
football
and
recovered
it
that
play
ended
up
producing
three
points
but
the
jets
defense
was
not
done
late
in
the
first
quarter
jenkins
flattened
edwards
and
edwards
pass
floated
into
the
hands
of
safety
abram
elam
at
the
jets

elam
who
was
starting
in
place
of
the
injured
eric
smith
took
off
up
the
right
sideline
slowing
before
stumbling
into
the
end
zone
for
a
137
lead
apparently
elam
made
a
similar
play
during
the
jets
last
practice
before
this
game
this
one
meant
a
little
more
it
was
a
big
momentum
swing
elam
said
speaking
of
big
momentum
swings
the
signing
of
the
350pound
jenkins
certainly
qualifies
the
jets
run
defense
has
been
their
primary
strength
this
season
and
with
bills
running
back
marshawn
lynch
missing
long
stretches
of
this
game
with
nausea
they
held
the
bills
to
30
yards
on
the
ground
jenkins
finished
with
five
tackles
two
sacks
and
three
quarterback
hits
he
was
credited
with
the
fourthdown
stop
of
running
back
fred
jackson
at
the
jets

midway
through
the
second
quarter
but
his
impact
stretches
like
his
waistline
far
beyond
the
stat
sheet
in
fact
while
mangini
called
jenkins
a
beast
several
teammates
went
further
calling
him
their
most
valuable
player
hes
two
guys
revis
said
we
dont
have
11
we
have
12
last
week
the
jets
spent
the
postgame
defending
their
victory
over
the
chiefs
talking
again
about
their
unrealized
potential
now
they
have
their
best
record
at
the
midway
point
since
2004
they
are
21
in
the
afc
east
20
in
the
division
on
the
road
on
a
twogame
winning
streak
they
have
built
a
topoftheline
run
defense
and
they
have
an
emerging
running
game
two
key
ingredients
when
the
weather
turns
worse
in
the
coming
months
on
sunday
the
stoic
mangini
even
smiled
talking
again
about
potential
safety
kerry
rhodes
stopped
the
question
before
it
finished
the
team
that
we
can
be
he
said
laughing
the
team
that
weve
been
hoping
saying
that
can
show
up
at
any
time
now
it
showed
up
today
now
weve
got
to
keep
it
going
if
sen
john
mccain
defies
the
polls
and
wins
pennsylvania
it
will
be
in
part
because
of
voters
like
harry
klemash
67
a
democrat
who
supported
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
in
the
primary
and
is
still
not
comfortable
with
sen
barack
obama
obama
has
too
many
socialist
policies
and
he
doesnt
have
enough
experience
klemash
a
retired
pressman
said
sunday
as
he
walked
his
miniature
poodle
in
marconi
park
in
south
philadelphia
a
largely
white
catholic
ethnic
neighborhood
with
the
presidential
election
a
day
away
the
polls
point
to
an
obama
victory
in
pennsylvania
with
obama
holding
a
big
lead
in
philadelphia
but
the
polls
are
tightening
and
mccain
has
shown
no
signs
of
letting
up
in
the
state
as
the
republicans
try
to
map
situations
in
which
mccain
could
pull
off
an
upset
they
are
focusing
on
philadelphias
mostly
white
enclaves
im
spending
a
lot
of
time
in
philadelphia
said
robert
gleason
the
chairman
of
the
state
republican
party
were
working
the
northeast
he
said
referring
to
a
largely
white
part
of
the
city
weve
got
values
voters
up
there
catholics
my
people
up
there
say
they
can
carry
four
to
six
wards
this
year
and
four
years
ago
they
carried
none
while
wealthier
whites
in
philadelphia
especially
in
center
city
overwhelmingly
support
obama
some
bluecollar
democrats
never
made
the
transition
from
supporting
clinton
in
south
philadelphia
mccain
signs
have
cropped
up
in
the
windows
of
the
low
brick
houses
and
on
the
postagestamp
lawns
hillary
won
some
of
those
white
wards
by
101
said
shanin
specter
son
of
sen
arlen
specter
rpa
and
a
lawyer
who
is
steeped
in
local
politics
obama
is
likely
to
significantly
underperform
kerry
and
gore
in
those
white
rowhouse
wards
the
state
republican
party
has
begun
running
advertisements
highlighting
obamas
ties
to
the
rev
jeremiah
a
wright
jr
his
former
pastor
which
could
tap
into
concerns
among
white
voters
the
obama
campaign
is
fully
aware
of
the
challenge
this
is
a
tough
ward
said
paul
rossi
61
a
data
processor
who
lives
in
the
neighborhood
and
is
helping
out
at
an
obama
office
that
opened
saturday
not
far
from
marconi
park
its
a
matter
of
convincing
people
culturally
that
they
wont
be
harmed
by
obama
it
is
no
accident
that
sen
joe
biden
obamas
running
mate
is
being
dispatched
to
speak
in
marconi
park
on
monday
night
for
his
final
rally
of
the
campaign
the
white
bluecollar
catholics
here
are
just
the
kind
of
voters
whom
biden
also
catholic
was
chosen
to
help
win
over
biden
is
to
be
joined
by
members
of
the
philadelphia
phillies
who
just
won
the
world
series
susan
streicher
59
a
retired
secretary
and
registered
democrat
acknowledged
that
bidens
catholicism
was
appealing
to
her
but
said
she
preferred
mccain
and
gov
sarah
palin
mccains
running
mate
because
they
oppose
abortion
rights
her
husband
john
63
a
postal
worker
dismissed
mccain
saying
that
he
was
a
warmonger
and
that
alaska
palins
home
state
is
all
wilderness
both
said
they
thought
obama
would
win
there
is
no
doubt
that
obama
who
won
philadelphia
in
the
primary
will
again
sweep
the
city
where
about
52
percent
of
voters
are
black
but
while
it
is
a
major
part
of
the
statewide
puzzle
it
is
still
only
a
piece
in
2004
sen
john
kerry
the
democrat
won
about
80
percent
of
the
vote
in
philadelphia
beating
president
bush
by
412000
votes
here
but
kerry
won
the
state
by
only
144000
votes
gov
edward
g
rendell
of
pennsylvania
said
sunday
that
although
he
still
expected
obama
to
win
the
state
he
was
nervous
and
had
been
on
the
phone
screaming
at
chicago
meaning
the
obama
headquarters
to
send
reinforcements
hillary
clinton
is
due
in
pittsburgh
on
monday
former
president
bill
clinton
is
to
stump
for
obama
in
erie
and
elsewhere
the
same
day
mccain
continues
to
devote
his
most
precious
resource
his
time
to
pennsylvania
he
made
three
inperson
pleas
to
voters
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
state
over
the
weekend
and
planned
a
final
short
rally
for
monday
at
the
pittsburgh
airport
although
mccain
has
paid
scant
attention
to
philadelphia
gleason
the
republican
state
chairman
said
mccain
hoped
to
do
better
in
the
city
than
bush
did
and
the
party
has
begun
running
advertisements
highlighting
obamas
ties
to
the
rev
jeremiah
a
wright
jr
his
former
pastor
which
could
tap
into
concerns
among
white
voters
in
south
philadelphia
gleason
said
with
the
battle
between
the
africanamericans
and
all
the
other
wards
we
can
keep
obama
under
a
400000
margin
in
philadelphia
he
added
with
a
laugh
i
get
a
big
salary
to
be
positive
rendell
agreed
that
because
of
the
white
wards
obama
might
get
a
smaller
percentage
of
the
philadelphia
vote
than
kerry
did
perhaps
75
percent
instead
of
kerrys
80
percent
but
with
additional
democratic
registrations
he
said
and
a
bigger
turnout
obama
would
exceed
kerrys
numbers
in
addition
rendell
said
mccain
could
not
rely
on
the
republicans
deepest
well
in
the
state
which
until
1992
had
been
the
four
suburban
counties
around
philadelphia
rendell
and
gleason
agreed
that
montgomery
county
the
most
affluent
and
liberal
of
the
four
would
vote
for
obama
and
that
bucks
and
delaware
counties
were
also
likely
to
swing
for
him
the
fourth
chester
county
is
closely
contested
elsewhere
in
the
state
mccain
needs
a
big
turnout
in
central
pennsylvania
and
is
making
an
incursion
into
the
scranton
area
in
counterpoint
to
mccains
appeal
there
to
catholic
democrats
the
obama
team
on
sunday
sent
in
caroline
kennedy
despite
the
frenzied
lastminute
campaigning
and
polls
suggesting
a
tighter
race
g
terry
madonna
a
political
analyst
at
franklin
ampamp
marshall
college
in
lancaster
said
he
expected
obama
to
win
the
state
by
at
least
seven
points
as
part
of
the
obama
campaigns
highly
organized
getoutthevote
operation
scores
of
volunteers
were
hustling
in
and
out
of
the
new
branch
office
here
on
sunday
many
were
from
out
of
state
including
two
women
from
new
york
who
said
they
had
expected
to
be
sent
to
more
rural
environs
and
were
surprised
when
they
were
sent
to
philadelphia
we
thought
oh
its
an
urban
area
its
done
said
marian
masone
57
a
film
curator
who
lives
in
brooklyn
they
said
they
were
also
surprised
by
the
negative
reaction
to
them
in
south
philadelphia
masone
and
her
friend
eileen
newman
62
who
works
in
film
management
and
lives
in
manhattan
said
that
some
people
said
no
way
to
them
about
obama
and
that
one
told
them
get
off
this
block
as
for
klemash
the
south
philadelphia
resident
he
said
he
was
ambivalent
about
mccain
too
mccain
is
too
close
to
bush
he
said
yet
he
admires
mccains
military
service
then
again
he
said
palin
was
a
bad
choice
as
mccains
running
mate
because
she
does
not
have
enough
experience
but
then
again
he
said
obama
does
not
have
enough
experience
either
his
conclusion
this
is
a
really
hard
election
the
new
york
times
said
in
editorials
for
monday
nov
3
lame
duck
summit
meeting
president
bush
will
be
the
lamest
of
ducks
by
nov
15
when
leaders
of
20
nations
meet
in
washington
to
discuss
the
global
financial
crisis
with
only
two
months
left
in
office
he
will
not
be
around
to
implement
any
policy
changes
he
proposes
or
agrees
to
bushs
bigger
problem
is
his
utter
lack
of
credibility
when
it
comes
to
the
central
question
of
how
to
regulate
national
and
global
financial
markets
to
ensure
that
this
disaster
never
happens
again
eight
years
and
a
huge
financial
crash
later
and
bush
is
still
extolling
the
corrective
powers
of
unrestrained
markets
still
the
meeting
could
not
and
should
not
wait
until
a
more
opportune
time
in
americas
political
cycle
with
the
world
entering
a
usled
recession
the
global
economic
powers
need
to
air
their
concerns
and
global
markets
need
to
see
that
political
leaders
are
ready
to
work
together
to
restore
stability
what
this
first
meeting
should
not
do
is
try
to
impose
any
real
policy
changes
with
the
crisis
still
unfolding
its
too
soon
for
extensive
reforms
philosophical
differences
are
also
too
deep
and
with
bush
on
his
way
out
the
americans
are
in
no
position
to
sign
anything
when
he
first
proposed
a
meeting
last
month
president
nicolas
sarkozy
of
france
called
for
everything
from
the
moralization
of
financial
markets
to
stricter
bank
supervision
and
government
aid
for
national
industries
bush
emphasized
the
need
to
preserve
free
markets
free
enterprise
and
free
trade
the
two
finally
agreed
that
the
meeting
would
review
progress
on
settling
the
crisis
and
seek
agreement
on
principles
of
reform
at
this
point
even
that
is
probably
too
much
the
summit
meeting
could
still
be
useful
if
the
leaders
used
it
to
begin
a
serious
discussion
about
the
roots
of
the
financial
crisis
and
agree
to
a
series
of
future
meetings
to
discuss
substantive
reforms
they
could
start
the
process
by
calling
for
formation
of
an
international
highlevel
group
of
nongovernment
experts
to
analyze
the
causes
and
implications
of
the
crisis
once
there
is
some
agreement
another
group
of
experts
could
lay
out
a
list
of
potential
policy
changes
that
would
give
the
next
president
a
running
start
we
congratulate
bush
for
insisting
that
the
invitation
list
be
expanded
beyond
the
wealthiest
industrial
nations
to
include
other
economically
important
ones
like
china
india
australia
and
brazil
they
are
also
being
hard
hit
by
the
madeinamerica
crisis
as
turmoil
in
the
financial
markets
weakens
economies
worldwide
threatening
vital
trade
and
these
countries
deserve
a
voice
in
any
longterm
solution
wed
like
to
believe
that
bush
after
eight
years
of
disdaining
diplomacy
and
anything
with
the
word
multilateral
attached
to
it
has
finally
figured
that
the
united
states
cannot
go
it
alone
given
the
country
the
next
president
will
inherit

heavily
indebted
oildependent
and
the
source
of
the
prevailing
financial
calamity

he
will
be
in
no
position
to
dictate
terms
to
the
rest
of
the
world
if
the
nov
15
meeting
can
set
the
stage
for
real
collaboration
it
will
be
a
success
gouging
women
on
health
insurance
as
tens
of
thousands
of
workers
lose
their
jobs

and
their
group
health
insurance

in
a
worsening
economy
they
will
have
to
scramble
to
find
affordable
insurance
policies
in
the
open
market
the
problems
will
be
particularly
acute
for
women
who
often
pay
far
higher
premiums
than
men
for
the
same
health
coverage
if
they
can
get
coverage
at
all
the
inequities
in
the
health
insurance
market
were
described
in
a
recent
report
by
the
national
womens
law
center
and
in
an
article
by
robert
pear
in
the
times
if
women
are
covered
by
an
employers
group
policy
they
are
usually
protected
by
federal
antidiscrimination
laws
the
states
however
regulate
the
market
for
individually
bought
policies
and
most
offer
women
few
protections
against
discrimination
new
york
is
a
notable
exception
after
checking
policies
around
the
country
pear
found
that
women
can
pay
hundreds
of
dollars
a
year
more
than
men
for
identical
coverage
the
law
centers
analysis
of
3500
individual
health
insurance
plans
found
that
insurers
charged
40yearold
women
anywhere
from
4
percent
to
48
percent
more
than
they
charged
men
of
the
same
age
the
study
also
found
that
in
some
states
insurers
are
allowed
to
reject
applicants
for
reasons
that
effectively
exclude
many
women
such
as
having
had
a
caesarean
section
or
surviving
domestic
violence
and
that
the
vast
majority
of
individual
policies
dont
cover
maternity
care
the
insurance
industry
justifies
charging
higher
premiums
on
actuarial
grounds

that
women
between
the
ages
of
19
and
55
make
greater
use
of
health
care
services
than
do
men
women
are
more
likely
to
take
prescription
medications
on
a
regular
basis
more
likely
to
have
chronic
conditions
requiring
ongoing
treatment
and
their
reproductive
health
needs
require
them
to
get
regular
checkups
whether
or
not
they
have
children
that
doesnt
explain
why
one
missouri
company
charges
40yearold
women
140
percent
more
than
men
another
only
15
percent
more
insurance
companies
long
ago
stopped
charging
premiums
based
on
race
even
though
they
offered
similar
actuarial
arguments
there
are
laws
against
using
gender
to
set
rates
in
employerbased
health
insurance
surely
it
is
time
to
eliminate
genderbased
premiums
in
the
individual
health
insurance
market
as
well
otherwise
women
who
typically
earn
less
than
men
may
find
themselves
priced
out
of
adequate
health
coverage
the
soiled
envelope
please
there
are
no
awards
for
the
seasons
slimiest
political
messages
swift
boat
statuettes
but
two
deserve
consideration
in
the
character
assassination
category
in
the
first
republicans
in
pennsylvania
flooded
75000
jewish
voters
with
an
email
alarum
from
a
retired
jewish
judge
equating
a
vote
for
barack
obama
with
the
tragic
mistake
of
jews
who
ignored
the
warning
signs
of
the
holocaust
quick
apologies
and
retractions
were
offered
once
this
surfaced
in
the
press
but
too
late
for
the
unspeakable
to
be
spiked
in
the
second
the
campaign
of
sen
elizabeth
dole
of
north
carolina
who
is
in
a
very
tight
race
broadcast
her
desperation
by
attacking
her
opponent
state
sen
kay
hagan
for
accepting
godless
money
at
a
secret
fundraiser
whose
hosts
included
a
leader
of
a
secularist
group
at
the
end
the
tv
screen
fills
with
a
shadowy
photo
of
hagan
an
elder
at
her
christian
church
as
a
female
voice
fairly
shrieks
there
is
no
god
then
there
is
the
fringe
madness
of
letter
from
2012
in
obamas
america

an
apocalyptic
fiction
making
the
rounds
from
the
conservative
christian
group
focus
on
the
family
action
it
foresees
an
obama
incumbency
marked
by
terrorist
attacks
on
american
cities
rampant
crime
as
guns
are
confiscated
a
nuclear
attack
on
israel
and
the
boy
scouts
disbanding
to
avoid
courtempowered
gay
leaders
it
seems
just
another
straightline
for
jon
stewart
until
the
nation
remembers
that
the
groups
leader
is
james
dobson
he
is
one
of
the
most
prominent
leaders
on
the
evangelical
right
with
an
audience
measured
in
the
scores
of
millions
the
democrats
have
their
share
of
slimy
ads
like
one
targeted
at
the
elderly
that
falsely
claims
john
mccain
would
cut
social
security
benefits
in
half
were
not
excusing
that
ad
or
any
other
policy
distortions
but
frankly
its
not
even
an
alsoran
compared
with
what
the
mccain
campaign
and
its
allies
have
been
up
to
among
the
experts
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
military
option
it
is
a
frightening
notion
but
it
is
not
just
the
triggerhappy
bush
administration
discussing

if
only
theoretically

the
possibility
of
military
action
to
stop
irans
nuclear
weapons
program
of
course
no
president
or
wouldbe
president
ever
takes
the
military
option
off
the
table
and
barack
obama
and
john
mccain
are
no
exception
what
is
significant
is
that
inside
washingtons
policy
circles
these
days

in
studies
commentaries
meetings
congressional
hearings
and
conferences

reasonable
people
from
both
parties
are
seriously
examining
the
socalled
military
option
along
with
new
diplomatic
initiatives
one
of
the
most
thorough
discussions
is
in
a
report
by
the
washingtonbased
bipartisan
policy
center
founded
by
four
former
senators

the
republicans
robert
dole
and
howard
baker
and
democrats
tom
daschle
and
george
mitchell

to
devise
policy
solutions
both
parties
might
embrace
the
report
warns
that
the
next
administration
might
have
little
time
and
fewer
options
to
deal
with
this
threat
it
explores
such
strategies
as
blockading
irans
gasoline
imports
but
it
also
says
that
a
military
strike
is
a
feasible
option
and
must
remain
a
last
resort
its
authors
include
dennis
ross
top
mideast
adviser
to
obama
and
former
sen
dan
coats
a
mccain
adviser
ashton
carter
a
senior
pentagon
official
in
the
clinton
administration
wrote
a
paper
for
the
center
for
a
new
american
security
a
prestigious
bipartisan
think
tank
that
asserts
military
action
must
be
seen
as
only
one
component
of
a
comprehensive
strategy
but
it
is
an
element
of
any
true
option
at
a
conference
in
september
in
virginia
sponsored
by
the
washington
institute
for
near
east
policy
surrogates
for
mccain
and
obama
insisted
america
must
focus
on
preventing
iran
from
developing
a
bomb
not
on
allowing
iran
to
produce
one
and
then
deterring
its
use
john
mccain
wont
wait
until
after
the
fact
declared
the
columnist
max
boot
from
the
mccain
team
the
arizona
senator
has
previously
said
risking
military
action
may
be
better
than
living
with
an
iranian
nuclear
weapon
and
to
his
regret
jokingly
sang
a
song
about
bomb
bomb
bombing
iran
richard
danzig
obamas
surrogate
said
his
candidate
believes
a
military
attack
on
iran
is
a
terrible
choice
but
it
may
be
that
in
some
terrible
world
we
will
have
to
come
to
grips
with
such
a
terrible
choice
early
in
the
primary
campaign
obama
declared
that
as
president
he
would
sit
down
in
his
first
year
in
office
with

among
others

irans
president
mahmoud
ahmadinejad
he
has
been
reparsing
that
commitment
ever
since
given
the
global
economic
meltdown
and
other
crises
it
is
not
surprising
if
the
american
public
is
largely
unaware
of
this
discussion
what
makes
me
nervous
is
thats
what
happened
in
the
runup
to
the
iraq
war
in
those
days
americans
were
reeling
from
the
shock
of
911
and
completely
focused
on
hunting
alqaida
in
afghanistan
in
washington
though
talk
quickly
shifted
to
the
next
target

iraq
bush
administration
officials
drove
the
discussion
but
the
cognoscenti
were
complicit
the
question
was
asked
and
answered
in
policy
circles
before
most
americans
knew
what
was
happening
would
the
united
states
take
on
saddam
hussein
absolutely
as
a
diplomatic
correspondent
for
reuters
in
those
days
i
feel
some
responsibility
for
not
doing
more
to
ensure
that
the
calamitous
decision
to
invade
iraq
was
more
skeptically
vetted
this
time
the
debate
is
not
so
onesided
most
experts
acknowledge
that
military
action
poses
big
risks
and
offers
no
guarantee
of
destroying
irans
nuclear
program
both
presidential
candidates
have
also
promised
new
diplomatic
initiatives
mccain
talks
of
tougher
sanctions
and
obama
proposes
a
comprehensive
approach
involving
sterner
penalties
more
compelling
incentives
and
direct
talks
with
iran
ross
who
was
top
mideast
negotiator
for
the
first
president
george
bush
and
for
president
bill
clinton
said
that
in
the
prelude
to
iraq
nearly
all
of
the
talk
focused
on
military
action
he
says
this
time
experts
are
taking
a
harder
more
systematic
look
at
all
options

including
force

because
diplomatic
efforts
have
failed
to
slow
irans
rush
to
master
nuclear
technology
i
want
to
concentrate
the
mind
and
make
people
understand
look
this
is
serious
and
you
dont
want
to
be
left
with
only
those
two
choices

war
or
living
with
an
iranian
bomb
he
said
with
iran
projected
to
produce
enough
fuel
for
a
nuclear
weapon
by
2010
the
next
president
is
going
to
have
to
concentrate
his
mind
quickly
we
hope
he
unlike
george
w
bush
will
encourage
a
broader
public
debate
about
all
of
americas
options
and
the
high
cost
of
another
war
i
will
certainly
be
a
lot
more
skeptical

katselas

iconoclastic
acting

30
years
in

him
to

status

hundreds
of
actors
many
of
them
famous
died
in
los

on
oct

he
was
75
and
lived
in
los

the
cause
was
a
heart
attack
said
gary
grossman
the
producing
director
of
the
beverly
hills
playhouse
the
acting
school
founded
by
katselas
in
1978
unlike
the
methodologists

stanislavski
adler
strasberg

katselas
was
a
pragmatist
who
declared
himself
open
to
any
and
all
acting
theories
if
they
got
results
and
he
was
a
realist
who
wanted
audience
members
to
recognize
the
humanity
of
the
people
they
saw
being
portrayed
he
said
it
was
important
for
the
butcher
to
be
able
watch
a
performance
of
a
butcher
onstage
and
say
thats
how
i
do
it
grossman
said
katselas
earned
the
loyalties
of
generations
of
students
with
keen
observations
not
of
the
characters
they
played
but
of
their
own
characters
openly
challenging
his
acting
students
to
face
their
own
weaknesses
and
problems
so
that
they
could
better
face
those
of
the
people

cromwell

reynolds
john
glover
george
clooney
kate
hudson
patrick
swayze
and
tyne
daly

remained
deeply
loyal
partly
because
the
criticism
katselas
offered
was
specific
and
pointed
and
partly
because
he
spoke
not
only
about
the
craft
but
also
about
the
profession
of
the
actor
offering
ideas
on
audition
preparation
and
role
selection

was
born
in
pittsburgh
on
feb
22
1933
to
greek
immigrant

mellon
university

he
spotted
the
director
elia
kazan
on

followed
him
until
kazan
a
fellow
greekamerican
engaged
him
in
conversation
and
promised
him
a
job
after
graduation
he
made
a
beeline
for
new
york
and
kazan
took
him
on
as
an
assistant
on
the
broadway
production
of
tea
and
sympathy
from
there
he
began
taking
classes
at
the

and
he

many
of
the
students
and
employees
at
the
beverly
hills
playhouse
were
scientologists
to
varying
degrees
of
commitment
and
deserved
or
not
a
faint
taint
of
cultism
hung
over
the
school
katselas
admitted
that
he
had
suggested
that
half
a
dozen
students
over
the
years
look
into
the
church
just
as
he
admitted
to
romantic
liaisons
with
several
students
however
the
times
magazine
article
dismissed
the
notion
that
he
was
a
proselytizer
as
did
several
people
who
were
interviewed
friday
i
know
it
played
a
part
in
his
life
the
actor
miguel
ferrer
said
but
what
he
really
cared
about
was
art
rabbi
moshe
cotel
an
acclaimed
pianist
and
composer
whose
works
were
often
infused
with
themes
emanating
from
his
deep
jewish
roots
a
weave
of
influences
that
only
later
in
life
led
him
to
the
pulpit
died
oct
24
at
his
home
in
manhattan
he
was
65
he
died
of
natural
causes
his
son
sivan
said
at
his
death
cotel
who
was
ordained
five
years
ago
was
spiritual
leader
of
temple
beth
el
of
manhattan
beach
in
brooklyn
my
religion
changed
from
judaism
to
classical
music
and
in
adulthood
it
changed
back
again
cotel
told
the
newspaper
jewish
week
last
march
performing
or
conducting
his
own
works
or
those
of
others
around
the
world
cotel
was
known
for
a
career
that
arched
from
early
romantic
compositions
to
atonal
unpredictable
avantegardist
scores
and
then
to
a
reversion
to
romanticism
that
morris
cotel
is
a
composerpianist
of
unusual
capabilities
seems
beyond
question
allen
hughes
wrote
in
the
new
york
times
in
1977
adding
that
his
playing
built
to
climaxes
of
absolutely
torrential
fury
morris
was
cotels
birth
name
among
his
notable
compositions
are
deronda
an
opera
based
on
george
eliots
novel
daniel
deronda
about
an
english
jew
who
is
a
protozionist
with
kabbalistic
ideas
and
trope
for
orchestra
a
choral
work
that
evokes
torah
cantillation
or
chanting
his
cantata
the
fire
and
the
mountains
memorializes
the
holocaust
not
all
of
cotels
works
were
connected
to
jewish
themes
his
night
of
the
murdered
poets
incorporated
writings
of
poets
and
intellectuals
murdered
in
the
stalinist
pogrom
of
1952
it
had
its
premiere
in
new
york
in
1978
with
the
actor
richard
dreyfuss
as
narrator
and
was
performed
around
the
country
in
subsequent
years
an
epiphany
for
the
composer
came
in
1994
nine
years
after
the
premiere
of
dreyfus
a
twoact
opera
it
was
based
on
the
treason
conviction
in
1894
of
alfred
dreyfus
a
jewish
officer
in
the
french
army
whose
trial
exposed
deeprooted
antisemitism
in
france
opera
news
praised
it
as
compelling
in
its
traditional
lyricism
and
newwave
originality
performances
of
dreyfus
were
scheduled
for
germany
and
austria
in
the
early
1990s
to
improve
his
german
the
composer
found
a
tutor
an
old
german
widow
living
in
upper
manhattan
after
returning
from
europe
he
spotted
the
woman
on
the
street
she
greeted
him
in
hebrew
and
told
him
that
she
had
been
so
inspired
by
his
telling
of
the
dreyfus
story
that
she
had
returned
to
judaism
an
identity
she
had
forsaken
since
the
nazi
onslaught
my
life
changed
right
then
and
there
it
was
like
a
voice
came
down
into
my
head

indianapolis

he
wont
be
adding
to
his
collection
of
afc
offensive
player
of
the
week
awards
because
the
stats
dont
leap
on
the
page
and
this
isnt
likely
to
be
remembered
as
the
day
he
made
the
quintessential
leap
because
his
team
didnt
emerge
with
the
sort
of
comefrombehind
victory
that
can
define
a
young
quarterback
but
its
hard
to
find
much
fault
with
the
performance
turned
in
by
patriots
quarterback
matt
cassel
last
night
cassel
completed
25
of
34
passes
for
204
yards
with
no
touchdowns
and
one
interception
as
new
england
fell
to
the
indianapolis
colts
1815
at
lucas
oil
stadium
the
numbers
dont
tell
the
story
of
a
quarterback
who
looked
poised
and
confident
while
battling
another
afc
power
in
a
hostile
environment
if
you
squinted
hard
enough
you
might
have
thought
no
12
was
under
center
for
the
patriots
and
this
was
a
night
the
patriots
desperately
needed
a
leader
on
offense
the
patriots
wanted
to
keep
peyton
manning
and
the
colts
offense
on
the
sideline
as
long
as
possible
and
cassel
put
together
numerous
sustained
drives
his
only
fault
was
he
couldnt
turn
those
drives
into
touchdowns
but
he
shouldnt
shoulder
all
the
blame
for
that
jabar
gaffney
dropped
what
looked
to
be
a
sure
touchdown
pass
late
in
the
third
quarter
the
patriots
settled
for
the
last
of
stephen
gostkowskis
three
field
goals
tying
the
game
at
15
early
in
the
fourth
quarter
those
were
the
last
points
the
patriots
scored
gaffney
took
the
blame
in
the
locker
room
sitting
in
a
chair
and
softly
telling
reporters
over
and
over
again
i
just
dropped
the
ball
but
in
an
interview
room
around
the
corner
cassel
wasnt
willing
to
pin
the
loss
on
a
single
play
or
player
i
just
told
him
to
keep
his
head
up
said
cassel
jabar
makes
that
play
all
the
time
cassel
admitted
he
didnt
see
how
close
the
pass
was
to
being
caught
a
perfect
39yard
lob
down
the
left
sideline
with
gaffney
wide
open
as
the
colts
converged
on
randy
moss
in
the
slot
but
cassel
did
know
how
close
the
patriots
came
to
winning
which
left
a
bad
taste
in
his
mouth
its
tough
to
take
said
cassel
we
played
a
tight
game
and
lost
by
3
points
you
take
your
hat
off
to
the
colts
we
have
to
regroup
and
get
ready
for
next
week
when
the
sting
of
letting
a
winnable
road
game
slip
away
wears
off
the
patriots
should
look
back
fondly
on
the
performance
of
cassel
and
the
offense
in
only
the
seventh
start
of
his
pro
career
cassel
stood
in
the
pocket
with
confidence
and
didnt
take
a
single
sack
despite
facing
one
of
the
leagues
fiercest
pass
rushes
he
rushed
five
times
scrambling
early
in
the
game
to
avoid
pressure
but
otherwise
stood
in
the
pocket
and
delivered
his
passes
with
poise
in
typical
cassel
fashion
he
praised
the
offensive
line
for
its
play
the
offensive
line
really
stepped
up
tonight
said
cassel
in
the
locker
room
his
teammates
were
offering
the
same
praise
in
return
coach
bill
belichick
wouldnt
directly
compliment
his
quarterback
choosing
to
speak
in
generalities
about
cassels
performance
i
thought
overall
we
played
a
good
football
game
but
came
up
a
couple
plays
short
said
belichick
i
thought
we
played
very
well
in
all
areas
and
just
came
up
a
few
plays
short
cassel
would
admit
as
much
while
he
thrived
putting
together
lengthy
drives
the
patriots
ran
67
plays
to
the
colts
50
he
struggled
to
get
his
team
into
the
end
zone
the
lone
touchdown
drive
came
on
the
first
possession
of
the
second
half
a
15play
72yard
march
culminating
on
a
6yard
run
by
benjarvus
greenellis
cassel
converted
three
first
downs
on
the
drive
scrambling
for
one
and
finding
moss
and
wes
welker
for
two
others
but
he
couldnt
produce
the
same
magic
in
the
fourth
quarter
after
an
unnecessary
roughness
penalty
on
david
thomas
that
pushed
the
patriots
out
of
field
goal
range
with
less
than
five
minutes
to
play
cassel
was
intercepted
by
bob
sanders
on
a
desperation
heave
to
benjamin
watson
on
fourth
and
15
from
the
indianapolis
45
the
patriots
got
the
ball
back
at
their
20
with
21
seconds
to
play
but
didnt
cross
midfield
from
one
week
to
the
next
you
just
try
to
continue
to
get
better
said
cassel
you
see
different
looks
and
you
become
more
comfortable
with
your
teammates
thats
where
im
at
right
now
he
didnt
make
the
leap
but
if
last
night
was
any
indication
it
could
be
coming

fans
at

dropping
them
into
a

tie
for

who
visit

this
sunday
without
quarterback
tom
brady
and
safety
rodney
harrison
with
just
three
healthy
running
backs
and
an
inexperienced
and
injurysaddled
secondary
the
patriots
decided
their
best
defense
was
a
clockkilling
possessive
offense
they
limited
indianapolis
to
just
seven
possessions
for
the
game
held
a
3424
to
2536
advantage
in
time
of
possession
and
held
the
colts
to
just
18
points
the
plan
worked
until
the
very
end
when
an
untimely
drop
an
illtimed
penalty
a
lack
of
timeouts
and
a
timely
clutch
kick
by
former
patriots
kicker
adam
vinatieri
had
the

fall

belichick
weve
just
got
to
do
a
little
more
with

after
stephen

booted
his

goal
of
the

with
1133
remaining
to
tie
it
1515
the

got
the

back
and
drove
from

18
to
the

vinatieri
then
connected
on
a
52yard
field
goal
with
805
remaining
to
give
the
colts
an
1815
lead
matt

acquitted
himself
quite
well
in
his
matchup
against

going
25
of

for
204
yards
got
the

at

with

moved

to

15
carries
for

yards
and
a
touchdown
suddenly
the
patriots
who
had
no
timeouts
were
out
of
field
goal
range
and
facing
third
and
16
with
the
indianapolis
wide
receivers
as
open
as
the
retractable
roof
at
peytons
new
place
most
of
the
night
belichick
elected
to
go
for
it
on
fourth
and
15
with
440
to
play
and
cassel
was
intercepted
by
safety
bob
sanders
at
the
indianapolis
25
i
was
just
trying
to
make
a
block
and
i
never
heard
a
whistle
and
it
was
a
critical
mistake
and
it
really
cost
us
said
thomas
thomas
wasnt
the
only
one
who
made
questionable
judgment
calls
in
the
second
half
on
the
patriots
15play
drive
to
tie
the
game
at
15
belichick
called
a
timeout
rethinking
his
decision
to
go
for
it
on
fourth
and
1
from
the
indianapolis
7
the
play
was
executed
prior
to
the
whistle
and
cassel
picked
up
the
first
down
on
a
sneak
but
the
timeout
negated
it
and
the
patriots
who
had
no
timeouts
with
1138
to
go
in
the
game
had
to
settle
for
a
field
goal
belichick
said
he
didnt
get
a
good
look
at
the
placement
of
the
ball
and
thought
that
it
was
fourth
and
inches
when
it
was
closer
to
a
yard
i
thought
it
was
too
long
for
a
quarterback
sneak
he
said
however
it
never
would
have
come
to
that
point
if
wide
receiver
jabar
gaffney
who
was
wide
open
had
not
dropped
a
wouldbe
39yard
touchdown
pass
at
the
6yard
line
earlier
in
the
drive
i
dropped
it
said
gaffney
he
made
a
good
throw
i
dropped
it
i
dont
make
any
excuses
it
hit
my
hands
i
should
have
caught
it
the
patriots
had
taken
a
127
lead
on
the
opening
drive
of
the
second
half
an
impressive
15play
72yard
march
that
was
capped
by
a
6yard
td
run
by
greenellis
but
the
drive

and
the
decisions
made
on
it

proved
costly
in
the
long
run
new
england
had
to
squander
a
timeout
on
the
drive
and
lost
another
one
when
belichick
on
first
and
10
from
the
indy
45
chose
to
issue
a
video
replay
challenge
of
an
illegal
substitution
flag
against
the
colts
that
was
picked
up
by
the
officials
he
lost
the
challenge
trailing
76
at
the
half
belichick
said
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
if
his
team
scored
he
was
going
for
the
2point
conversion
but
the
colts
stuffed
running
back
kevin
faulk
inches
short
of
the
goal
line
the
colts
wasted
no
time
retaking
the
lead
four
minutes
to
be
exact
as
manning
21
of
29
for
254
yards
and
2
tds
capped
a
nineplay
57yard
drive
with
his
second
td
toss
of
the
game
to
anthony
gonzalez
a
9yarder
the
colts
also
went
for
2
and
manning
threaded
a
pass
to
reggie
wayne
to
give
indy
a
1512
lead
with
312
left
in
the
third
quarter
the
patriots
strategy
was
to
take
the
air
out
of
the
ball
and
away
from
the
colts
offense
all
of
new
englands
scoring
drives
were
13
plays
or
longer
and
the
shortest
lasted
618
it
was
wellexecuted
but
it
just
wasnt
enough
as
potent
of
an
offense
as
manning
and
those
guys
to
keep
the
ball
away
from
them
its
basically
like
playing
defense
in
itself
said
patriots
cornerback
ellis
hobbs
so
the
offense
they
did
their
job
for
the
most
part
defense
did
their
job
for
the
most
part
but
as
a
whole
we
didnt
do
it
enough
because
we
didnt
win

as
the
years
have
gone
by

adam
vinatieri
has
not
been
a
patriot
since
the
2005
season

there
has
developed
a
general
feeling
that
the
best
kicker
the
patriots
ever
had
isnt
quite
what
he
used
to
be
especially
as
the
length
of
attempted
field
goals
increases
not
all
share
that
opinion
hes
longer
than
he
used
to
be
stated
hunter
smith
his
holder
for
the
colts
smiths
point
was
proven
dramatically
when
vinatieri
boomed
a
52yarder
in
the
fourth
quarter
that
provided
the
colts
with
the
winning
points
in
an
1815
victory
over
the
patriots
last
night
vinatieri
of
course
had
two
super
bowlwinning
kicks
for
the
patriots
but
after
the
2005
season
he
signed
with
the
colts
as
a
free
agent
and
the
patriots
moved
on
with
stephen
gostkowski
vinatieri
continued
his
magical
postseason
career
making
three
field
goals
as
the
colts
beat
the
bears
in
the
super
bowl
following
the
2006
season
still
hes
been
in
the
league
for
13
years
and
there
does
exist
a
school
of
thought
that
he
doesnt
have
the
range
he
once
had
in
fact
he
hadnt
made
a
field
goal
of
50
yards
or
longer
in
the
regular
season
since
2002
really
said
vinatieri
sounding
surprised
well
its
nice
to
know
i
still
have
some
lead
left
in
the
pencil
with
the
game
tied
1515
the
colts
moved
from
their
18yard
line
but
then
faced
a
fourthand7
from
the
patriots
34
it
was
either
play
the
position
game
with
a
short
punt
or
let
vinatieri
try
a
52yarder
but
the
patriots
had
put
together
four
timeconsuming
drives
there
was
no
hesitation
on
the
sideline
according
to
vinatieri
and
smith
theres
a
right
time
and
a
wrong
time
to
try
ones
that
long
and
this
was
clearly
the
right
time
said
vinatieri
both
stephen
and
i
were
hitting
them
from
55
yards
out
during
warmups
we
were
booming
the
ball
out
there
i
hit
it
pretty
well
it
definitely
left
my
foot
feeling
pretty
good
in
fact
it
cleared
the
goal
post
easily
truth
be
told
it
would
have
been
good
from
15
yards
further
said
smith
who
also
noted
that
the
snap
and
hold
went
perfectly
there
may
be
some
future
50plusyarders
in
vinatieris
future
because
the
new
lucas
oil
stadium
seems
to
be
kicker
friendly
besides
vinatieris
field
goal
the
patriots
chris
hanson
had
a
64yard
punt
and
smith
averaged
543
yards
from
three
punts
the
roof
was
open
in
the
stadium
but
the
244foot
wide
by
88foot
tall
window
was
closed
on
the
north
end
of
the
stadium
the
window
was
at
vinatieris
back
when
he
kicked
the
winning
field
goal
though
he
didnt
think
the
window
had
any
effect
the
patriots
never
said
that
vinatieris
best
days
were
behind
him
when
he
left
for
indianapolis
and
vinatieri
expresses
no
outward
bitterness
toward
his
old
team
we
just
needed
a
victory
he
said
we
need
to
get
back
on
the
winning
side
we
had
two
straight
losses
and
we
needed
to
find
a
way
to
get
a
win
you
couldnt
call
it
a
must
win
but
it
sure
was
important
the
colts
are
now
44
and
the
patriots
are
53
both
teams
are
used
to
being
playoff
locks
but
they
might
have
to
make
the
playoffs
as
a
wild
card
this
season
thats
especially
true
of
the
colts
who
trail
undefeated
tennessee
by
four
games
in
the
afc
south
even
without
tom
brady
out
there
they
still
have
a
great
team
said
vinatieri
of
the
patriots
matt
cassel
manages
the
team
very
well

great
games
come
in
different
forms
some
are
shootouts
some
are
defensive
struggles
but
the
entertaining
thrilling
game
the
patriots
and
colts
played
last
night
fell
into
a
different
category

it
was
possessionbased
filled
with
long
drives
played
with
a
razorthin
margin
for
error
the
patriots
needed
to
go
that
route
if
they
were
to
win
mainly
because
their
pass
defense
was
a
bad
matchup
against
peyton
manning
and
co
it
turns
out
the
colts
also
minus
key
players
in
the
secondary
needed
to
go
the
same
route
because
they
feared
receivers
randy
moss
and
wes
welker
it
was
really
a
fieldposition
game
and
both
teams
were
really
working
the
clock
a
lot
and
i
think
thats
mutual
respect
from
both
teams
said
colts
kicker
adam
vinatieri
whose
52yard
field
goal
turned
out
to
be
the
difference
in
the
1815
victory
you
try
to
keep
their
offense
off
the
field
because
both
teams
have
a
lot
of
explosive
firepower
that
can
put
points
on
the
board
said
vinatieri
it
seemed
like
it
was
real
methodical
drives
that
were
taking
six
seven
eight
minutes
it
just
made
each
possession
that
much
more
important
and
you
had
to
capitalize
on
every
one
of
them
in
the
end
both
teams
had
just
seven
drives
and
in
games
like
that
coaches
and
players
from
both
sides
agreed
that
its
the
team
that
makes
the
plays
in
critical
situations
that
comes
out
on
top
and
thats
where
the
separation
ultimately
came
into
play
with
the
patriots
hurt
by
a
dropped
wouldbe
touchdown
by
jabar
gaffney
in
the
third
quarter
and
a
devastating
personal
foul
penalty
on
tight
end
david
thomas
that
knocked
the
team
out
of
range
for
a
tying
field
goal
in
the
fourth
it
also
hurt
that
the
patriots
were
out
of
timeouts
the
result
of
a
failed
challenge
in
the
third
quarter
in
which
bill
belichick
felt
the
colts
had
12
men
on
the
field
another
timeout
taken
later
in
that
drive
and
then
a
final
timeout
burned
early
in
the
fourth
quarter
on
a
fourthand1
with
both
teams
vulnerable
on
defense
they
adopted
conservative
plans
colts
receiver
reggie
wayne
and
tight
end
dallas
clark
said
the
patriots
were
playing
cover2
keeping
their
two
safeties
in
the
deep
part
of
the
field
to
take
away
the
big
play
so
the
colts
adjusted
and
found
success
in
the
real
estate
in
front
of
those
safeties
the
same
was
true
with
the
colts
defensive
approach
as
they
were
without
starting
cornerbacks
marlin
jackson
injured
reserve
and
kelvin
hayden
it
was
a
tough
matchup
on
us
said
indianapolis
coach
tony
dungy
we
played
some
double
coverage
on
wes
welker
and
then
they
went
to
randy
moss
we
didnt
want
to
single
moss
all
that
often
and
give
him
a
chance
to
make
big
plays
so
we
played
a
lot
of
zone
then
they
threw
the
ball
underneath
and
they
had
some
good
runs
on
us
it
was
one
of
those
games
where
we
did
all
we
could
on
defense
and
did
keep
them
from
having
the
big
plays
said
patriots
quarterback
matt
cassel
you
have
to
take
what
they
give
you
in
this
type
of
ballgame
it
comes
down
to
one
possession
and
they
were
able
to
get
that
last
possession
at
the
end
of
the
game
and
we
werent
able
to
counter
that
we
had
the
penalty
late
and
that
hurt
us
that
makes
the
difference
in
possessionstyle
games
third
down
and
red
zone
loom
large
the
colts
were
6
of
10
on
third
down
while
the
patriots
were
a
solid
8
of
14
the
difference
came
in
the
red
zone
where
the
colts
cashed
in
on
both
of
their
trips
with
touchdowns
while
the
patriots
could
punch
it
in
just
once
in
four
tries
that
helps
explain
how
the
patriots
who
had
drives
of
13
13
15
15
and
8
plays
could
have
a
commanding
time
of
possession
edge
34242536
and
still
lose
the
game
was
played
in
a
tidy
2
hours
41
minutes
tied
for
the
patriots
quickest
of
the
year
you
really
kind
of
figure
thats
how
its
going
to
be
with
these
guys
because
they
do
a
great
job
of
possessing
the
ball
and
of
time
management
said
clark
we
were
scoring
touchdowns
when
we
got
into
the
red
zone
and
they
were
getting
field
goals
and
i
thought
that
was
the
big
part
of
the
game
we
knew
it
would
come
down
to
the
last
possession
patriots
linebacker
adalius
thomas
said
thats
pretty
much
what
it
came
down
to
mike
reiss
can
be
reached
at
mreissglobecom
indianapolis

the
game
plan
was
masterful
pure
bill
belichick
genius
the
execution
was
something
else
and
in
the
end
belichick
heard
more
hard
questions
than
grady
little
the
colts
beat
the
patriots
1815
at
lucas
oil
can
boyd
stadium
last
night
and
as
always
the
ponies
and
pats
thrilled
america
with
60
minutes
of
bonerattling
actionpacked
football
the
patriots
came
within
a
couple
of
plays
a
jabar
gaffney
drop
and
a
david
thomas
penalty
of
winning
the
game
and
still
managed
to
come
home
with
a
share
of
first
place
in
the
afc
east
scramble
it
took
a
52yard
field
goal
from
adam
vinatieri
you
may
have
heard
of
him
to
beat
new
england
and
in
the
midnight
hour
belichick
was
grilled
about
going
for
a
2point
conversion
in
the
middle
of
the
third
quarter
calling
a
timeout
that
appeared
to
negate
a
first
down
on
fourth
and
1
from
the
colts
7
new
england
settled
for
a
field
goal
and
electing
to
go
for
it
on
fourth
and
15
from
the
colts
45
with
440
left
belichick
also
had
an
unsuccessful
challenge
in
the
second
half
and
burned
his
final
timeout
with
1138
left
to
play
mercy
mr
hoodie
has
answers
for
all
of
the
above
but
its
difficult
to
remember
a
game
that
turned
on
so
many
debatable
decisions
by
the
vaunted
new
england
coach
all
of
them
blew
up
in
his
face
and
thats
unusual
it
was
odd
to
see
the
coach
on
the
hot
seat
after
a
game
in
which
his
master
plan
was
particularly
brilliant
the
patriots
knew
the
colts
were
faster
and
more
experienced
new
englands
defense
had
four
rookies
on
the
field
for
most
of
the
snaps
the
climate
was
ripe
for
a
peyton
manning
highlight
reel
and
the
patriots
knew
they
were
in
trouble
so
what
did
belichick
do
he
shortened
the
game
he
played
stall
ball
he
had
matt
cassel
throwing
a
succession
of
short
passes
he
ran
kevin
faulk
on
draw
plays
he
tried
a
few
direct
snaps
to
faulk
cassel
carried
out
his
orders
nicely
qb
16
was
never
sacked
gained
20
yards
on
five
carries
and
completed
25
of
34
passes
cassel
watched
with
the
rest
of
us
when
the
game
slipped
through
the
fingers
of
gaffney
on
what
would
have
been
a
39yard
touchdown
pass
at
the
end
of
the
third
quarter
had
the
patriots
won
this
game
they
would
have
been
in
sole
possession
of
first
place
in
the
afc
east
instead
they
are
tied
with
the
bills
and
jets
with
a
53
record
they
play
both
at
gillette
stadium
in
the
next
week
and
a
half
the
colts
made
a
couple
of
more
plays
than
we
did
said
belichick
we
had
our
chances
disappointing
but
we
have
some
pretty
good
games
coming
up
a
game
against
buffalo
and
we
are
going
to
turn
our
sights
toward
that
playing
on
national
television
in
front
of
66508
people
at
spectacular
lucas

the
patriots
did
a
masterful
job
most
of
the
way
belichicks
goal
was
to
keep
manning
off
the
field
and
new

you

i
like
to
head
for

water

i
feel
overwhelmed
by
current

and
things

the

give
me
a
hammock
where
i
might
hear
an
owl
let
me
paddle
among
ancient
reptiles
and
look
for
balance
in
our
tandem
kayak
we
slip
past
a
great
blue
heron
in
a
cypress
we
meander
around
a
sunken
log
we
paddle
under
the
low
branches
of
an
ancient
oak
as
we
pass
below
i
automatically
check
for
moccasins
above
my
head
just
in
case
years
ago
when
i
was
younger
and
more
impressionable
an
oldtimer
known
for
hyperbole
told
me
breathlessly
about
the
time
a
moccasin
fell
from
a
branch
into
his
canoe
first
he
battled
the
venomous
snake
with
his
paddle
it
kept
coming
its
cottoncolored
mouth
opened
wide
finally
he
shot
it
with
his
pistol
killing
the
snake
but
piercing
the
bottom
of
his
own
canoe
he
had
to
swim
through
alligators
to
reach
the
shore
anyway
that
was
his
story
doubtless
exaggerated
even
so
watching
for
moccasins
in
branches
has
become
a
lifelong
habit
one
day
i
hope
to
see
a
moccasin
in
a
tree
because
i
like
the
idea
that
anything
can
happen
on
a
florida
waterway
paddling
a
kayak
requires
in
addition
to
balance
paying
attention
you
dont
want
to
dawdle
under
the
wrong
tree
spruce
creek
which
snakes
12
miles
east
through
volusia
county
before
flowing
into
strickland
bay
and
the
atlantic
beyond
is
one
of
those
halfwild
halfcivilized
places
where
you
will
encounter
alligators
sleeping
on
logs
if
you
are
lucky
and
teenagers
on
jet
skis
if
you
arent
you
may
even
run
into
the
ghost
of
ponce
de
leon
the
first
european
to
visit
the
continent
senor
ponce
named
la
florida
in
1513
according
to
some
accounts
he
sailed
a
skiff
through
an
ocean
inlet
into
a
bay
and
headed
west
into
a
creek
most
likely
spruce
creek
what
did
he
make
of
our
dragons
the
alligators
surely
they
focused
his
attention
they
always
do
for
me
yes
we
have
museums
and
restaurants
and
fine
universities
but
the
presence
of
dinosaurs
is
what
makes
florida
florida
i
assume
that
ponce
de
leon
declined
to
take
a
dip
in
spruce
creek
you
couldnt
pay
me
to
swim
in
it
on
purpose
either
the
water
is
dark
stained
like
tea
from
decaying
leaves
and
mostly
shallow
if
you
startle
a
gator
off
the
bank
into
the
creek
dont
be
alarmed
if
its
back
brushes
your
kayak
or
be
very
alarmed
i
have
been
bumped
by
an
alligator
once
or
twice
but
im
still
here
a
manatee
sleeping
just
under
the
waters
surface
is
much
more
likely
to
knock
you
into
the
drink
if
you
startle
it
by
accident
kayaking
among
manatees
requires
balance
too
i
have
never
seen
a
deer
or
bobcat
sipping
from
the
creek
but
other
people
have
i
mostly
see
softshell
turtles
sunning
themselves
i
see
laurel
and
live
oaks
and
pignut
hickories
sweetgums
cypress
and
cabbage
palms
on
the
wild
side
of
the
river
back
in
the
trees
lie
the
hidden
mounds
constructed
for
burial
and
ceremonial
sites
more
than
five
centuries
ago
by
the
timucuan
people
the
natives
who
greeted
ponce
when
he
came
ashore
the
wily
spaniard
hoped
for
gold
or
if
nothing
else
a
sip
from
a
magic
fountain
that
would
restore
his
fading
youth
he
got
neither
in
fact
15
years
later
during
his
travels
to
floridas
west
coast
he
encountered
the
far
fiercer
calusas
who
deposited
an
arrow
into
his
hip
he
died
from
the
infection
belted
kingfishers
green

anhingas
ponce
saw

a

kayaker
sees
them
too
turn
around
in
modern
florida
just
before
you
reach
the
interstate
95
bridge
and
head
back
into
old
florida
where
an
alligator
snoozes
on
a
log
my
wife
wonders
if
it
might
upset
our
kayak
i
doubt
it
but
wouldnt
it
be
cool
wed
have
such
a
story
to
tell
instead
heres
my
story
a
little
past
the
alligator
i
hear
the
roar
of
a
jet
looking
south
through
the
trees
i
see
an
enormous
house
a
mansion
really
on
the
bluff
and
next
to
the
mansion
is
a
twostory

hangar
the
spruce

flyin
advertised
as
the

finest

katharine
jefferts

head
of

church
visits
the
diocese
of
southwest
florida
this
week
jefferts
schori
who
leads
more
than
24million
episcopalians
worldwide
and
34000
in
the
bay
area
is
coming
to
tampa
for
the
biannual
meeting
of
the
national
association
of
episcopal
schools
its
her
first
visit
as
presiding
bishop
we
talked
with
her
friday
as
she
prepared
for
her
trip
whats
the
state
of
the
episcopal
church
most
every
place
i
visit
congregations
and
dioceses
are
energetically
engaged
in
serving
their
neighbors
both
nearby
and
far
away
what
gets
reported
in
the
media
is
a
matter
of
a
relatively
few
people
who
are
exceedingly
unhappy
and
very
noisy
youve
been
in
office
for
almost
two
years
describe
the
landscape
of
the
church
in
some
sense
i
think
were
past
the
worst
of
the
current
controversies
i
think
most
people
are
realizing
that
there
are
a
variety
of
opinions
in
this
church
about
the
current
hotbutton
issues
as
there
have
always
been
a
variety
of
opinions
about
matters
of
great
interest
in
the
church
im
fond
of
reminding
people
that
in
the
late
1800s
people
were
arguing
vehemently
about
whether
or
not
you
could
put
candles
on
the
altar
significant
numbers
of
people
left
the
church
over
that
issue
the
current
controversy
is
not
new
in
its
heat
what
is
new
is
the
speed
with
which
its
communicated
around
the
world
but
i
think
as
episcopalians
were
remembering
that
we
value
a
diversity
of
opinion
and
thats
part
of
our
health
and
part
of
our
dna
are
you
any
closer
to
resolving
the
controversial
issues
which
include
disagreements
over
the
ordination
of
gay
priests
im
not
sure
these
issues
are
ever
going
to
be
fully
resolved
i
think
its
a
matter
of
learning
to
live
in
the
tension
of
not
moving
completely
in
one
direction
or
the
other
thats
what
anglicans
are
good
at
and
have
been
good
at
through
our
history
many
people
view
the
episcopal
church
as
one
of
the
most
liberal
denominations
in
the
united
states
how
do
you
feel
about
that
characterization
i
dont
think
thats
accurate
were
actually
very
conservative
in
our
liturgical
tradition
we
worship
in
ways
that
are
very
much
like
the
ways
the
early
christian
communities
worshiped
were
conservative
in
the
sense
that
we
retain
the
best
of
what
comes
from
the
past
and
were
progressive
in
the
sense
that
we
think
our
job
is
in
every
generation
to
present
the
gospel
in
language
and
images
that
can
be
understood
by
new
generations
what
would
you
say
to
individuals
who
might
be
considering
leaving
the
denomination
i
would
remind
them
that
their
voice
and
their
gifts
are
welcome
and
needed
in
this
church
and
that
we
lament
their
going
if
they
decide
they
need
to
go
at
the
same
time
if
they
decide
they
need
to
pursue
their
spiritual
journey
in
another
place
we
pray
all
the
best
for
them
why
did
the
denomination
feel
the
need
to
apologize
recently
for
its
historical
role
in
the
institution
of
slavery
the
proximate
cause
was
a
resolution
passed
at
our
last
general
convention
in
2006
asking
the
church
to
formally
apologize
for
its
participation
in
the
sin
of
slavery
we
did
that
in
a
formal
way
on
oct
4
my
hope
is
that
service
is
the
first
of
many
services
that
will
happen
in
local
dioceses
and
in
congregations
as
people
begin
to
discover
the
history
of
their
communities
over
the
last
several
hundred
years
how
theyve
participated
in
slavery
how
theyve
benefited
from
slavery
how
they
continue
to
benefit
from
injustice
in
this
country
what
have
you
learned
about
yourself
since
youve
been
in
office
ive
learned
that
i
keep
on
learning
every
day
presents
opportunities
for
discovering
in
greater
depth
what
it
means
to
be
a
messenger
of
good
news
in
this
world
how
would
you
characterize
your
time
in
office
busy
and
full
and
a
great
delight
and
a
great
joy
to
see
the
church
engaged
in
mission
in
all
its

long
before

they
lined
up
outside
in

dark
later
they
stood
in
a
cold
steady
rain
some
cradled
sleeping
children
as
they
waited
in
line
for
hours
in
an
age
of
voter
apathy
these
people
really
wanted
to
make
their
voices
heard
thousands
of
tampa
bay
residents
turned
out
to
the
polls
sunday
the
last
day
of
early
voting
their
passion
showed
why
this
has
been
a
recordshattering
season
of
early
voting
in
florida
more
than
a
third
of
the
states
registered
voters
have
cast
ballots
for
tuesdays
election
according
to
numbers
released
sunday
by
the
state
elections
division
about
37
percent
of
the
112million
registered
voters
or
42million
had
cast
ballots
nearly
26million
of
those
votes
were
cast
at
early
voting
locations
the
rest
were
submitted
via
absentee
ballot
nearly
17million
many
who
waited
in
long
lines
sunday
saw
this
as
their
last
chance
to
vote
while
its
true
that
the
polls
are
open
for
12
hours
on
election
day
a
lot
of
people
with
children
and
jobs
doubted
they
would
be
able
to
cast
ballots
on
tuesday
thats
why
were
here
said
andrew
meyer
of
st
petersburg
my
wife
has
to
open
up
her
business
in
the
mornings
i
work
in
tampa
and
take
our
two
kids
to
school
the
couple
went
to
st
petersburgs
early
voting
site
and
found
a
line
stretching
for
three
blocks
so
they
drove
to
largo
only
to
wait
for
two
hours
the
lines
that
snaked
around
government
buildings
sunday
were
dominated
by
supporters
of
barack
obama
a
striking
number
of
them
were
firsttime
voters
no
matter
their
age
i
never
cared
before
said
stephanie
patten
31
of
clearwater
people
around
me
encouraged
me
to
vote
said
chris
monastra
31
of
seminole
who
waited
with
his
wife
and
two
small
children
from
7
am
until
the
polls
opened
at
noon
why
vote
sunday
i
cant
afford
to
take
a
day
off
i
work
for
a
moving
company
and
dont
know
when
i
get
off
from
day
to
day
some
counties
are
reporting
double
or
triple
the
number
of
early
voters
this
year
compared
with
2004
said
jennifer
davis
of
the
florida
division
of
elections
in
pinellas
county
many
of
the
3000
people
who
voted
sunday
were
angry
about
long
lines
some
criticized
the
county
elections
supervisor
deborah
clark
for
opening
only
three
early
voting
sites
the
minimum
required
by
law
hillsborough
county
had
13
sites
pasco
had
seven
clark
a
republican
said
sunday
that
it
was
difficult
to
find
sites
with
enough
space
and
parking
and
that
she
hopes
to
see
the
legislature
allocate
more
funding
to
early
voting
she
says
her
offices
aggressive
absentee
ballot
campaign
is
more
costeffective
and
easier
for
voters
because
they
can
vote
at
home
pinellas
had
43226
early
voters
and
160039
absentee
voters
through
saturday
far
fewer
early
voters
and
far
more
absentee
voters
than
hillsborough
or
pasco
counties
democrats
are
more
likely
to
visit
early
voting
sites
republicans
are
more
likely
to
vote
via
absentee
the
result
331000
more
florida
democrats
than
republicans
had
cast
ballots
as
of
sunday
many
of
the
obama
supporters
waiting
in
line
sunday
said
they
didnt
trust
mailin
ballots
not
in
florida
said
debra
gooden
of
clearwater
making
their
pitch
the
long
column
of
voters
outside
the
supervisor
of
elections
office
in
largo
provided
a

this
was
a

kind
of
concert
for
jimmy

fans
sunday
for
one
it
was
free
and
for
another
even
the

on

i

dtampa
you
can

it
on

the

day
closes
in
sens
barack
obama
and
john

are
clawing
for
floridas
27
electoral
votes
staging
a
flurry
of
personal
appearances
and
sending
bigname
standins
like
jimmy
buffett
when
they
cant
be
here
themselves
mccain
held
a
midnight
rally
sunday
and
will
be
in
tampa
first
thing
this
morning
obama
is
in
jacksonville
today
the
equation
is
a
simple
one
obama
can
reach
the
magic
270
electoral
votes
even
if
he
doesnt
carry
florida
but
mccain
cannot
so
for
mccain
the
late
hard
push
to
win
florida
is
about
survival
for
obama
it
is
about
reaching
checkmate
david
chroman
who
spent
the
week
volunteering
for
obama
took
a
break
in
the
stands
of
the
ford
amphitheatre
in
tampa
for
sundays
free
buffett
concert
he
was
among
about
15000
who
showed
up
for
the
free
show
that
ran
a
full
hour
he
wore
a
tiedye
shirt
and
said
he
understood
why
buffett
would
support
obama
they
both
stand
for
positivity
he
said
jimmy
is
one
of
the
most
optimistic
people
ive
ever
seen
obamas
call
for
hope
rings
a
similar
tune
craig
cameron
from
brandon
sang
a
different
song
as
an
outnumbered
mccain
fan
he
came
strictly
for
the
music
and
said
hed
ignore
the
politics
i
still
like
jimmy
buffett
he
said
but
mccain
isnt
going
it
alone
in
florida
at
square
one
burgers
in
south
tampa
earlier
in
the
day
about
225
people
turned
out
to
see
former
new
york
city
mayor
rudy
giuliani
among
them
were
new
jersey
residents
carl
ceragno
and
aj
oconnor
who
happened
to
be
in
town
they
hadnt
been
to
any
mccain
rallies
yet
but
didnt
want
to
miss
a
chance
to
see
their
northeast
neighbor
we
really
wish
he
couldve
stayed
in
the
running
ceragno
said
but
we
love
mccain
too
oconnor
quickly
added
giuliani
walked
through
the
standingroomonly
restaurant
crowd
to
cheers
of
rudy
rudy
giuliani
got
serious
he
said
polls
that
show
obama
in
the
lead
are
just
trying
to
psych
you
out
and
he
said
he
expects
mccain
to
pull
off
the
greatest
comeback
victory
in
history
right
now
he
told
the
crowd
we
need
john
mccain
more
than
he
needs
us
he
brought
up
remarks
by
obamas
running
mate
sen
joe
biden
who
recently
told
supporters
that
obama
would
be
tested
by
a
foreign
crisis
soon
after
coming
into
office
giuliani
suggested
that
might
be
good
reason
to
elect
somebody
else
nobody
tested
dwight
eisenhower
nobody
tested
ronald
reagan
giuliani
said
nobody
with
half
a
brain
is
going
to
test
john
mccain
in
a
threestop
swing
across
north
florida
biden
focused
on
the
economy
he
spoke
to
a
crowd
of
more
than
1000
at
langford
green
at
florida
state
university
in
tallahassee
he
borrowed
the
old
reagan
campaign
slogan
are
you
better
off
today
than
you
were
four
years
ago
but
offered
it
with
a
twist
democrats
and
republicans
know
were
not
better
off
he
said
biden
talked
about
the
longest
walk
a
parent
can
take
being
the
walk
up
the
flight
of
stairs
into
their
childs
bedroom
to
tell
them
theyre
going
to
have
change
schools
because
a
parent
has
lost
a
job
folks
if
we
can
help
wall
street
we
should
be
able
to
help
monroe
street
said
sen
biden
referring
to
one
of
tallahassees
main
commercial
arteries
biden
drew
comparisons
between
mccain
and
president
bush
pointing
out
how
mccain
said
on
meet
the
press
last
week
that
he
and
bush
share
a
common
philosophy
you
cant
call
yourself
a
maverick
if
all
youve
been
in
the
last
eight
years
is
a
sidekick
biden
said
florida
state
and
florida
aampampm
university
students
packed
the
speech
which
also
drew
a
couple
of
dozen
student
protesters
who
chanted
john
mccain
and
made
siren
noises
throughout
bidens
speech
were
witnessing
history
right
now
said

biden
on

obama
is
the

left
are

passengers
can
look

even
the
airlines
name
is
unfamiliar
gulfstream
international
the
little
fort
lauderdale
carrier
that
flies
as
the
continental
connection
has
taken
on
a
more
prominent
role
at
tampa
international
airport
as
bigger
competitors
retreat
from
lessprofitable
florida
destinations
gulfstream
has
been
the
only
airline
flying
directly
between
tampa
and
tallahassee
since
oct
1
when
delta
air
lines
dropped
the
route
the
carrier
also
has
a
monopoly
on
flights
from
tampa
to
pensacola
key
west
and
fort
walton
beach
all
routes
delta
previously
abandoned
weve
always
tried
to
do
what
the
bigger
airlines
cant
says
gulfstream
ceo
david
hackett
the
companys
rising
profile
has
come
with
some
controversy
including
questions
about
the
way
it
trains
pilots
and
allegations
from
a
former
pilot
that
gulfstream
cut
corners
on
maintenance
and
flight
safety
hackett
called
the
claims
nonsense
we
run
a
good
airline
he
said
just
the
sight
of
propellers
on
a
tiny
plane
is
enough
to
turn
off
many
travelers
customers
much
preferred
deltas
50seat
regional
jets
to
gulfstreams
slower
noisier
bumpier
beechcraft
1900
turboprops
hackett
admits
but
they
no
longer
make
economic
sense
flying
between
most
florida
cities
the
jets
guzzle
600
gallons
of
fuel
per
hour
thats
about
four
times
as
much
as
a
turboprop
with
jet
engines
that
turn
propellers
instead
of
fan
blades
jets
fly
twice
as
fast
at
cruise
altitude
but
they
dont
pay
off
on
short
flights
with
too
few
passengers
to
spread
out
the
additional
costs
when
gas
was
1
a
gallon
you
could
use
them
to
poach
passengers
from
other
carriers
says
john

of

one

that
includes
flying

of

airlines
typically
require
applicants
to
fly
a
minimum
number
of
hours

he
says
students
fly
on
15
to
20
percent
of
gulfstream
flights
hackett
said
all
come
to
the

gulfstream
says
the
company
also
faces
a
whistleblower
complaint
filed
in
december
by
a
former
gulfstream
captain
kenny
edwards
tried
to
cancel
a
flight
from
tampa
to
west
palm
beach
that
he
considered
too
hazardous
a
device
in
the
cockpit
that
warns
pilots
of
potential
midair
collisions
wasnt
working
he
said
edwards
worried
about
flying
the
plane
through
thick
clouds
over
an
area
of
south
florida
crowded
with
student
pilots
supervisors
told
him
the
plane
was
legal
to
fly
without
a
working
collisionavoidance
device
and
ordered
him
to
fly
back
to
west
palm
beach
when
edwards
refused
they
found
another
captain
to
make
the
trip
edwards
was
fired
the
next
day
they
like
to
say
if
its
legal
youve
got
to
go
says
edwards
now
working
at
a
restaurant
near
his
home
in
phoenix
i
think
passengers
would
rather
have
the
captain
decide
if
its
not
good
to
go
but
its
not
like
that
he
also
told
investigators
that
gulfstream
managers
tried
to
intimidate
pilots
into
flying
beyond
faa
dutytime
limits
and
mechanics
sign
off
on
aircraft
inspections
they
never
performed
the
agency
concluded
in
february
that
gulfstream
hadnt
broken
any
safety
rules
but
officials
reopened
the
investigation
two
months
later
after
edwards
took
his
complaints
to
staffers
of
the
house
transportation
and
infrastructure
committee
the
panel
was
investigating
maintenance
deficiencies
at
major
airlines
hackett
points
to
a
us
labor
department
investigation
that
found
the
airline
was
within
its
rights
to
fire
edwards
gulfstream
has
won
the
faas
diamond
award
for
maintenance
training
and
is

slow
danced

please

at
the
eighth

dance
who
drooled
on
new
kids
pillowcases
who
lived
in
their
black
bomber
jackets
from
the
1989
hangin
tough
tour
it
was
surreal
performing
a
mix
of
old
hits
and
new
songs
from
their
album
the
block
the
new
kids
filled
the
stage
with
a
thoroughly
entertaining
glittery
spectacle
this
time
around
they
stepped
up
the
sexual
innuendo
to
satiate
their
grown
fans
hip
thrusts
timed
with
fireworks
anyone
opening
new
song
single
caused
piercing
shrieks
but
that
was
beans
compared
with
the
cries
when
heartthrob
jordan
knight
wailed
falsetto
on
the
1990
tune
my
favorite
girl
or
when
the
guys
flexed
their
oldschool
dance
moves
during

you
got
it
the

there
were
awkward
moments
shy

be

watching

popping
his
booty
under

a

gave
the

time
to
get
to
the
middle
of
the
venue
where
they
danced
on
a
round
platform
in
a
sea
of
fans
they
brought
the
energy
right
back
flirting
with
women
on
the
sexy

in
the
morning
they
ended
the
night
with
a
blissful
mix
of
giddy
classics
step
by
step
and
hangin
tough
the
loyal
boston
sports
fans
even
briefly
donned
tampa

lightning
jerseys
the
whole
thing
left
fans
sweaty
tipsy
lusty
and
thoroughly
reminded
of
a
simple
time
in
life
when
their
biggest
problem
was
whether
your
mom
would
get
you
the
right
new
kids
stuff
for
christmas
whatever
their
magic
formula
its
back
the
new

it
best
in

the
pastor
of
beulah
baptist
institutional
church
tampas
oldest
black
baptist

of
worship
preaches
the
red
off
the
devil
he
is
preaching
to
a
group
of
black
tampa
pastors
about
hiv
he
is
laying
out
his
vision
for
prevention
to
be
realized
by
tampas
black
churches
he
wants
screening
counseling
family
assistance
the
pastors
feed
him
quiet
yeses
and
amens
for
a
long
time
churches
have
pushed
aids
to
the
side
we
put
our
heads
in
the
sand
amen
to
that
its
not
here
not
in
our
churches
then
we
found
members
of
our
congregations
dying
how
could
we
treat
them
we
didnt
even
want
to
shake
their
hands
amen
to
that
too
pastor
favorite
how
do
we
bring
into
our
teaching
the
use
of
condoms
we
believe
abstinence
is
the
answer
but
there
are
those
who
will
not
listen
we
have
to
tell
them
that
the
least
they
can
do
is
use
a
condom
pastor
favorite
gets
polite
silence
in
tampas
black
neighborhoods
the
statistics
scream
black
family
disease
more
blacks
have
hiv
than
any
other
ethnic
group
one
in
85
blacks
in
hillsborough
county
is
infected
that
is
more
than
four
times
the
rate
for
whites
the
disparity
is
more
pronounced
among
women
one
in
every
92
black
women
in
hillsborough
is
infected
that
is
11
times
the
rate
for
white
women
this
black
family
disease
thats
what
favorite
calls
it
preys
on
even
fathers
and
mothers
in
the
pews
children
in
sunday
school
he
wants
the
full
gamut
of
services
for
his
vulnerable
congregation
and
he
wants
it
based
in
his
landmark
church
one
founded
in
1865
for
freed
slaves
he
wants
a
partnership
with
the
health
department
similar
to
one
initiated
by
floridas
black
ame
churches
ames
florida
bishop
has
committed
to
providing
a
church
for
hiv
screening
in
every
county
theyre
halfway
to
their
goal
but
pastors
whose
beliefs
are
biblically
founded
get
caught
in
a
moral
paradox
if
they
base
an
hiv
prevention
program
on
abstinence
alone
theyre
bound
to
fail
if
they
provide
the
common
medically
recommended
option
condoms
theyve
compromised
their
principles
religion
has
never
been
about
options
one
church
in
miami
resolved
the
paradox
by
leaving
condoms
in
a
garbage
can
outside
the
church
rev
favorite
isnt
about
to
build
an
hiv
outreach
program
for
tampas
black
families
on
garbage
cans
to
understand
the
silence
favorite
must
contend
with
talk
to
abe
brown
no
one
need
educate
abe
brown
on
the
devastation
of
aids
in
tampas
black
communities
no
one
need
convince
abe
brown
that
religion
and
medicine
pose
a
powerful
partnership
against
the
disease

at

the
retired
senior
pastor
of
first
baptist
church
of
college
hill
is
the
unbending
oak
staff
of
tampas
black
religious
community
he
is
favorites
mentor
and
founder
of
pastors
on
patrol
a
street
ministry
that
favorite
now
leads
brown
has
seen
hiv
facetoface
on
his
patrols
in
his
prison
ministry
among
exinmates
and
among
wives
and
babies
he
has
seen
it
in
the
church
pews
we
dont
require
physicals
of
people
who
come
to
church
he
says
we
dont
turn
away
people
who
come
to
church
for
help
so
abe
brown
supports
whatever
hiv
intervention
program
favorite
comes
up
with
if
favorite
wants
to
include
condoms
thats
his
decision
but
brown
cant
quite
let
it
go
at
that
he
frowns
struggles
just
to
say
the
word
condom
its
not
a
word
he
has
ever
used
in
his
ministry
brown
was
once
known
famously
as
mean
dean
brown
the
disciplinary
dean
at
chamberlain
high
school
he
likes
to
tell
how
he
patrolled
the
parking
lot
looking
for
cars
that
took
up
two
spaces
he
wrote
down
the
tag
numbers
and
traced
the
owners
summoned
them
to
his
office
they
gaped
at
him
asked
how
he
tracked
them
down
thats
my
secret
his
personal
feelings
about
hiv
are
not
that
different
you
park
your
car
right
in
one
space
you
live
right
you
sleep
in
one
bed
brown
will
not
criticize
favorites
hiv
strategy
but
the
mean
dean
brown
in
him
cant
bring
himself
to
find
any
good
in
the
word
condom
its
another
way
to
sin
safely
a
cheap
detour
past
the
hard
road
to
salvation
its
two
parking
spaces
from
the
pulpit
we
teach
abstinence
the
bible
says
dont
do
it
to
understand
the
need
for
the
churches
blessing
talk
to
the
rev
jerry
nealy
he
is
an
associate
pastor
at
the
tiny
woodframe
friendly
missionary
baptist
church
on
central
avenue
he
teaches
sunday
school
he
is
a
member
of
favorites
pastors
on
patrol
but
by
now
his
name
should
have
been
better
known
in
tampa
he
should
have
been
a
star
in
the
naacp
he
broke
the
color
barrier
at
chamberlain
high
he
found
the
lord
when
he
was
20
ralph
abernathy
offered
him
a
job
with
the
southern
christian
leadership
conference
in
atlanta
and
helped
him
get
into
morehouse
college
he
came
back
to
tampa
to
work
for
the
naacp
in
1988
he
got
hiv
he
doesnt
want
to
spell
out
how
all
anyone
needs
to
know
is
i
got
baggage
he
lost
his
job
his
name
and
his
home
he
kept
his
infection
a
secret
for
six
years
i
was
no
magic
johnson
i
didnt
want
anyone
to
know
what
would
people
say
there
was
a
taboo
in
the
black
churches
there
was
no
compassion
nealy
stopped
hiding
in
1994
obtaining
the
medicines
that
have
saved
his
life
now
57
he
advocates
for
openness
through
the
minority
aids
council
in
tampa
he
would
like
the
words
hiv
and
condoms
to
be
everyday
conversation
at
the
dinner
table
over
the
coffee
table
hell
talk
about
his
own
infection
his
own
downfall
if
he
thinks
it
will
help
anyone
still
he
lives
in
alternate
worlds
the
faith
and
church
he
follows
point
toward
abstinence
his
own
hard
experience
points
toward
choices
if
they
wont
accept
a
spiritual
medicine
he
says
in
the
interest
of
life
lets
offer
an
alternative
to
understand
how
hard
it
is
to
commit
to
the
long
haul
talk
to
the
rev
bernard
smith
he
calls
himself
the
total
pioneer
the
lone
eagle
of
hiv
outreach
for
more
than
six
years
smith
has
offered
hiv
testing
at
greene
chapel
ame
church
in
largo
his
was
the
first
in
pinellas
he
has
formed
partnerships
with
the
pinellas
county
health
department
the
state
and
the
giant
hivtesting
company
abbott
laboratories
together
they
launched
a
pilot
screening
program
at
six
tampa
bay
ame
churches
people
came
in
got
their
mouths
swabbed
the
swabs
were
sent
off
for
state
testing
those
who
tested
positive
received
counseling
for
life
after
hiv
the
pilot
ended
on
aug
31
smith
called
it
a
big
success
but
its
over
his
volunteers
still
swab
for
hiv
three
times
a
week
at
greene
chapel
but
no
longer
have
the
sponsorship
that
paid
for
food
and
supplies
smith
would
like
to
move
the
screening
to
a
separate
building
he
has
been
turned
down
for
bank
loans
continuity
of
support
has
always
been
iffy
smith
has
now
put
almost
20
years
in
hiv
prevention
where
do
we
go
from
here
even
he
has
a
problem
saying
the
word
condom
we
believe
in
abstinence
he
says
has
smith
ever
placed
a
condom
in
someones
hands
he
pauses
for
several
seconds
we
dont
advertise
them
he
says
our
no
1
focus
is
abstinence
but
has
he
ever
put
a
condom
in
a
persons
hand
he
pauses
again
we
serve
the
saved
and
the
unsaved
to
understand
the
possibilities
of
biblical
reconciliation
talk
to
favorite
he
leads
his
deacons
through
the
oakhurst
square
apartments
behind
beulah
baptist
on
a
saturday
morning
once
a
month
the
deacons
knock
on
doors
throughout
the
downtown
tampa
neighborhoods
theyre
not
just
selling
salvation
theyre
urging
people
to
come
to
the
church
on
wednesdays
when
a
nurse
offers
basic
health
screenings
they
find
every
kind
of
medical
need
imaginable
among
those
who
answer
their
knock
favorite
grew
up
on
a
louisiana
plantation
he
studied
teaching
at
southern
louisiana
university
where
he
grew
up
the
only
successful
blacks
he
knew
were
schoolteachers
if
favorite
had
ever
met
a
black
medical
doctor
as
a
child
he
is
certain
he
would
have
studied
medicine
instead
one
of
his
friends
at
beulah
baptist
is
dr
emile
commedore
director
of
floridas
office
of
minority
health
when
favorite
preaches
hiv
prevention
to
fellow
pastors
commedore
has
his
back
he
stresses
the
public
health
aspects
of
aids
and
the
innocence
of
many
of
its
victims
including
wives
and
children
condoms
are
no
more
than
a
means
to
an
end
the
doctor
tells
the
preachers
favorite
is
willing
to
debate
hiv
from
a
biblical
perspective
he
is
a
serious
student
of
the
bible
as
well
as
its
hebrew
and
greek
roots
he
often
refers
to
1
john
chapter
2
verse
1
if
any
man
sins
we
have
an
advocate
with
the
father
here
in
the
humble
oakhurst
square
apartments
words
like
that
resonate
there
are
many
sinners
even
they
have
an
advocate
theres
a
greek
word
in
the
new
testament
that
also
resonates
with
favorite
metanoia
because
of
its
complexity
favorite
likes
to
apply
it
to
his
vision
for
hiv
outreach
in
its
biblical
context
the
word
means
repentance
in
classical
greek
metanoia
has
another
meaning
it
means
to
change
ones
mind
to
change
ones
heart

the

it
harder
to

whether

rivetts
lawsuit
specifically
targets
two
bank
employees
nicolas
rodriquez
and
steve
kriegbaum
who
he
says
befriended
him
over
several
months
before
offering
to
refinance
his
home
rodriquez
and
kriegbaum
declined
to
comment
for
this
story
referring
questions
to
a
bank
attorney
who
did
not
return
repeated
calls
rivett
said
he
met
rodriquez
branch
manager
and
vice
president
of
regions
bank
at
14965
n
florida
ave
in
early
2007
when
the
banker
came
into
rivetts
private
investigations
office
to
market
business
accounts
rivett
opened
one
rivett
says
rodriquez
would
take
him
to
lunch
out
for
drinks
and
to
sporting
events
he
said
he
grew
comfortable
enough
with
rodriquez
to
share
personal
problems
including
a
growing
addiction
to
painkillers
that
he
started
taking
after
a
car
crash
in
2004
around
that
time
the
economy
was
slowing
down
rivett
recalled
that
combined
with
his
addiction
was
taking
a
toll
on
his
business
his
credit
card
debt
was
building
his
cash
flow
was
not
rodriquez
told
rivett
refinancing
could
help
and
the
bank
was
offering
a
great
deal
rivetts
home
which
he
purchased
in
2002
for
a
little
more
than
200000
had
built
equity
on
june
12
2007
over
chinese
food
at
lunch
rivett
signed
a
stack
of
documents
for
a
430000
loan
at
a
92
percent
fixed
interest
rate
it
wasnt
great
but
the
30000
cash
hed
receive
at
the
end
would
allow
him
to
pay
off
debt
and
market
his
business
a
closer
look
at
the
documents
provided
by
rivetts
attorney
revealed
problems
according
to
the
hillsborough
property
appraiser
rivetts
home
was
worth
233874
plus
the
application
prepared
by
rodriquez
did
not
list
rivetts
daughter
as
a
dependent
when
asked
now
if
the
inconsistencies
gave
him
pause
rivett
confides
truthfully
i
didnt
read
it
i
just
signed
i
thought
i
can
get
my
life
back
on
track
hes
going
to
save
me
by

2007
regions
bank
had
denied
rivetts
loan
according
to
paperwork
given
to

attorney
rivett
said
he
wasnt
immediately
told
about
the
denial
instead
rodriquez
and
kriegbaum
assistant
vice
president
of
the
regions
bank
and
mortgage
at
13902
n
dale
mabry
asked
to
meet
with
rivett
for
lunch
all
was
well
with
the
loan
rivett
said
they
told
him
on
june
22
2007
a
new
appraisal
valued
rivetts
house
at
460000
according
to
paperwork
submitted
by
the
bank
a
few
weeks
later
rivett
was
asked
to
provide
information
about
his
business
including
the
number
of
clients
at
the
time
i
told
him
i
had
about
500
clients
rivett
said
recalling
a
phone
conversation
with
kriegbaum
he
goes
hey
put
it
up
to
like
5000
itll
look
better
to
the
underwriters
that
was
only
one
of
several
red
flags
at
the
july
25
2007
closing
rivett
and
his
wife
debbie
noticed
her
name
had
been
removed
from
the
loan
because
of
her
credit
score
yet
her
income
was
still
listed
at
the
time
kriegbaum
told
them
that
regions
denied
the
loan
so
they
had
to
go
through
a
new
outofstate
bank
to
get
it
rivett
said
the
new
loan
had
a
107
percent
adjustable
interest
rate
rivetts
payments
would
go
from
3345
for
the
first
three
years
to
3832
for
the
next
26
years
with
a
282000
balloon
payment
at
the
end
debbie
rivett
was
angry
i
said
this
is
ridiculous
kriegbaum
tried
to
ease
their
apprehension
she
said
he
said
i
know
all
this
seems
kind
of
fast
and
real
high
debbie
rivett
recalled
but
this
will
put
money
in
your
bank
right
now
and
well
turn
around
and
refinance
in
a
couple
months
a
few
days
later
when
rivett
went
to
pick
up
his
50000
check
the
cash
increased
during
the
deal
he
wasnt
emptyhanded
he
had
stopped
to
buy
three
bottles
of
crown
royal
for
kriegbaum
and
a
300
watch
for
rodriquez
earlier
both
men
had
requested
the
thankyou
gifts
for
helping
rivett
out
of
his
jam
rivett
said
by
the
time
the
first
payment
arrived
rodriquez
and
kriegbaum
had
stopped
calling
rivett
said
the
money
lasted
less
than
a
year
in
april
rivett
had
a
heart
attack
because
of
his
drug
use
after
a
stint
in
rehab
helped
clear
his
mind
he
said
he
decided
to
sell
the
home
and
go
after
the
bank
by
then
he
was
a
month
behind
on
his
mortgage
and
citibank
owned
his
loan
the
bank
allowed
rivett
to
sell
his
home
for
about
277656
a
loss
for
the
bank
of
about
136000
because
of
his
health
problems
he
said
its
not
just
losing
your
house

who
the
best
team
in

in

november
folks
here
comes
bcs
chaos
just
when
you
think
youve
got
it
figured
out
the
ghosts
appear
forgotten
rivalry
oklahoma
and
nebraska
played
saturday
night
time
was
that
was
right
up
there
with
ohio
statemichigan
as
the
game
of
the
year
in
college
football
true
the
game
was
nationally
televised
on
espn
but
it
was
on
while
the
country
minus
sooners
and
huskers
fans
was
tuned
in
to
texastexas
tech
how
strange
is
it
that
oklahomanebraska
wasnt
even
the
best
game
in
that
conference
on
that
day
let
alone
the
game
of
the
year
kansas
city
mo
after
watching
his
team
fall
behind
by
21
points
in
the
second
quarter
matt
bryant
never
dreamed
the
greatest
comeback
in
bucs
history
would
come
down
to
his
right
foot
but
it
did
actually
three
times
within
a
matter
of
seconds
in
overtime
and
the
seventhyear
pro
out
of
baylor
made
it
count
when
it
finally
mattered
his
34yard
field
goal
with
436
elapsed
in
overtime
gave
tampa
bay
an
improbable
3027
victory
over
the
chiefs
bryants
first
attempt
of
37
yards
sailed
through
the
uprights
but
not
before
kansas
city
called
a
timeout
forcing
a
rekick
on
third
and
5
from
the
20
his
next
attempt
fluttered
wide
right

but
that
effort
didnt
count
either
thanks
to
a
falsestart
penalty
against
bucs
tackle
jeremy
trueblood
facing
third
and
10
from
the
25
the
offense
went
back
on
the
field
and
quarterback
jeff
garcia
hit
fullback
jameel
cook
for
9
yards
setting
the
stage
for
bryants
winner
bryant
33
spoke
about
the
emotional
rollercoaster
what
was
going
through
your
mind
after
the
missed
field
goal
just
to
have
a
short
memory
the
wind
was
doing
goofy
things
in
that
stadium
it
was
swirling
and
all
of
a
sudden
on
that
one
kick
it
kind
of
straightened
out
it
went
right
when
it
should
have
come
back
left
you
block
it
out
and
go
to
your
next
kick
and
here
we
are
can
it
be
helpful
to
have
some
practice
kicks
before
the
real
one
kind
of
but
each
kick
is
different
no
matter
how
far
it
is
or
what
the
situation
is
at
least
we
try
to
approach
it
that
way
what
did
this
win
mean
for
the
team
its
great
it
would
have
been
terrible
to
go
into
the
bye
week
with
a
loss
but
to
win
the
way
we
did
i
think
its
just
going
to
make
us
hungrier
for
when
we
get
back
from
the
bye
week
did
you
think
it
would
come
down
to
a
field
goal
at
243
you
never
know
but
at
243
probably
not
i
wouldnt
have
bet
that
when
you
won
the
toss
in
overtime
how
did
you
feel
about
your
chances
clifton
smith
was
doing
a
great
job
all
day
giving
us
excellent
field
position
so
from
the
very
beginning
you
know
youre
going
to
have
a
legit
shot
and
jeff
garcia
has
done
this
many
times
leading
the
offense
down
there
it
was
a
total
team
effort
to
be
down
by
that
many
and
to
hold
them
and
keep
scoring
kansas

mo
ike
hilliard
held
his
face
in
his
hands
after
dressing
slowly
at
his
locker
at
arrowhead
stadium
until
there
was
no
denying
how
the
topsyturvy
afternoon
had
taken
its
toll
on
the
bucs
32yearold
receiver
he
already
had
pulled
on
his
slacks
shirt
and
vest
for
the
flight
home
to
tampa
according
to
hilliard
all
that
was
missing
from
his
suit
was
a
straightjacket
im
too
old
for
this
he
said
unreal
theyre
making
my
life
very
interesting
thats
the
very
best
i
can
say
theyre
allowing
me
to
have
a
lot
of
fun
it
was
crazy
crazy
relief
mixed
with
disbelief
was
the
prevailing
sentiment
of
bucs
players
and
coaches
after
their
historic
3027
overtime
victory
over
the
chiefs
on
sunday
after
watching
his
team
fall
behind
243
in
the
first
half
only
to
outscore
kansas
city
273
from
there
and
record
the
biggest
comeback
win
in
franchise
history
hilliard
put
it
into
perspective
heading
into
the
bye
week
bye
week
or
no
bye
week
you
look
at
our
team
and
how
weve
been
able
to
play
and
the
talk
that
we
had
all
week
about
avenging
the
dallas
loss
hilliard
said
to
come
out
and
play
so
poorly
we
have
to
look
at
what
weve
done
and
regroup
to
a
man
and
figure
out
how
to
not
be
so
flat
coming
out
on
the
road
against
a
team
we
shouldve
beat
and
put
away
thats
no
disrespect
to
the
chiefs
we
felt
we
had
a
chance
to
go
out
and
make
a
statement
after
a
tough
loss
on
the
road
on
the
other
hand
unreal
in
terms
of
the
resiliency
that
these
guys
showed
nowhere
was
that
more
apparent
than
in
the
final
two
drives
directed
by
jeff
garcia
whose
24yard
touchdown
pass
to
antonio
bryant
and
twopoint
conversion
bullet
to
alex
smith
tied
it
with
19
seconds
left
in
regulation
garcia
kept
the
football
away
from
the
chiefs
in
overtime
hitting
michael
clayton
for
29
yards
on
the
first
play
to
help
set
up
matt
bryants
34yard
field
goal
it
was
an
improbable
finish
for
the
bucs
who
committed
four
turnovers
three
fumbles
and
an
interception
against
a
team
that
entered
16
two
fumbles
came
in
the
red
zone
where
tampa
bay
has
scored
13
touchdowns
among
37
trips
this
season
including
2of6
on
sunday
all
last
week
the
bucs
stewed
over
their
failures
at
dallas
when
garcia
failed
to
launch
a
pass
into
the
end
zone
in
four
tries
on
the
final
drive
of
a
139
loss
this
time
trailing
2719
and
facing
a
first
and
15
at
the
kansas
city
24
garcia
took
his
shot
against
a
cover
2
defense
he
noticed
the
chiefs
safeties
had
been
cheating
to
the
middle
of
the
field
making
it
hard
to
help
their
cornerbacks
over
the
top
so
he
dropped
a
perfect
pass
over
the
head
of
cornerback
maurice
leggett
and
bryant
made
a
tremendous
catch
while
tightroping
the
sideline
in
the
end
zone
the
protection
up
front
gave
me
the
time
garcia
said
gave
me
the
lane
to
step
up
and
basically
look
inside
to
hold
defenders
and
put
a
ball
where
it
got
over
the
corners
reach
and
gave
antonio
a
chance
to
make
a
play
garcia
finished
31of43
for
339
yards
one
touchdown
and
one
interception
he
spread
the
ball
around
to
nine
receivers
but
his
favorite
target
was
bryant
who
hauled
in
a
teamhigh
eight
catches
for
115
yards
and
the
touchdown
smiths
sliding
catch
of
the
twopoint
conversion
which
resulted
in
a
sprained
right
ankle
came
on
a
play
they
had
worked
on
during
practice
for
several
weeks
there
was
a
whole
lot
going
on
and
you
just
want
to
secure
it
and
hold
on
tight
for
dear
life
smith
said
the
bucs
who
at
63
sit
a
halfgame
behind
the
idle
panthers
for
first
in
the
nfc
south
won
the
coin
toss
to
start
overtime
then
clayton
stayed
alive
for
a
scrambling
garcia
and
managed
to
keep
his
feet
after
a
short
reception
and
turned
it
upfield
getting
a
good
block
from
tight
end
jerramy
stevens
huge
play
by
michael
garcia
said
the
guy
is
a
physical
receiver
he
made
some
clutch
catches
all
day
long
but
that
was
the
biggest
catch
he
made
in
this
game
the
comeback
however
would
not
have
been
possible
if
not
for
two
plays
clifton
smiths

in

fumbled
at

earnest
graham
should
be
playing
quarterback
after
the
first
touchdown
pass
of
his
career
sunday
but
the
play
was
big
nonetheless
graham
found
te
alex
smith
for
a
3yard
touchdown
on
a
halfback
pass
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
fruition
of
weeks
of
flirting
with
the
idea
of
using
the
play
we
tried
it
out
a
little
bit
earlier
in
the
season
but
never
called
it
smith
said
we
put
it
in
the
game
plan
this
week
because
we
thought
we
had
a
good
chance
for
it
it
was
a
great
call
and
a
great
throw
by
earnest
he
said
he
couldnt
really
see
me
so
he
just
put
it
in
the
vicinity
fortunately
the
defense
bit
pretty
hard
said
graham
it
worked
out
just
like
we
thought
we
have
a
million
plays
weve
just
never
used
that
one
the
call
was
indeed
a
savvy
one
the
bucs
had
just
created
a
turnover
with
s
tanard
jacksons
strip
and
recovery
and
the
bucs
had
first
and
goal
at
the
chiefs
3
it
looked
like
a
run
all
the
way
they
were
going
hard
after
the
run
smith
said
we
could
see
they
were
digging
their
cleats
in
there
depending
on
how
you
look
at
it
sundays
victory
by
the

made
jon
gruden
the

alltime

it

you

in

and
three
in
the
postseason
all
during
tampa
bays
super
bowl
run
after
the
2002
season
if
you
just
count
the
regular
season
gruden
is
tied
with
dungy
at

dungy
has
two
postseason
wins
john
mckay
is
third
on
the
alltime
list
with
45
wins
in

in
his
seventh
season
with
the

gruden
has
won
three
division
titles
the
most
in
team
history
and
led
the
team
to
its
only
super
bowl
championship
its
hard
to
say
what
was
more
remarkable
about
clifton
smiths
97yard
kickoff
return
for
a
touchdown
in
the
second
quarter
was
it
the
feat
itself
which
featured
smith
darting
through
traffic
with
abandon
or
was
it
the
timing
for
coach
jon
gruden
the
answer
was
unequivocal
right
then
we
were
struggling
he
said
it
was
a
hot
day
and
it
was
not
going
well
that
gave
us
a
chance
clifton
gave
us
a
chance
and
gave
us
some
life
and
some
energy
facing
a
seemingly
insurmountable
243
deficit
and
the
offense
floundering
the
bucs
needed
a
pickmeup
they
got
more
than
that
with
the
franchises
second

touchdown
this
one
clearly
swaying
momentum
the
rookie
free
agent
from
fresno
state
wasnt
on
the
active

until

when
it
was
decided
he
would

does
that

look

now
not
so
fast

bucs
cb
phillip
buchanon
below
nearly
made
one
of
the
games
biggest
plays
when
he
intercepted
chiefs
qb
tyler
thigpen
and
raced
42
yards
to
the
chiefs
3yard
line
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
bucs
appeared
poised
to
score
the
goahead
touchdown
but
ss
sabby
piscitelli
was
called
for
illegal
contact
against
te
tony
gonzalez
before
the
change
of
possession
the
timing
of
the
infraction
negated
the
play
and
the
chiefs
kept
possession
an
interesting
thing
the
conversation
between
buchanon
and
tanard
jackson
before
the
play
jackson
said
to
me
hey
one
of
us
is
going
to
make
a
play
here
buchanon
said
i
was
thinking
hopefully
it
would
be
me
i
made
the
play
but
it
got
called
back
i
guess
he
was
right
for
both
of
us
jackson
had
a
forced
fumble
and
recovery
earlier
that
set
up
a
touchdown
keep
him
clean

for
the
fourth
time
this
season
the
bucs
didnt
allow
a
sack
sundays
achievement
was
notable
because
qb
jeff
garcia
attempted
43
passes
in
an
effort
to
rally
making
their
offense
predictable
i
thought
the
pass
protection
was
outstanding
coach
jon
gruden
said
lt
donald
penn
was
happy
with
the
effort
because
it
came
against
a
defensive
front
that
the
bucs
regard
highly
they
probably
are
underrated
he
said
of
the
chiefs
defense
theyre
a
good
defensive
line
we
executed
when
it
counted
and
thats
what
helped
us
come
out
on

garcia
was
able
to
consider
multiple
options
before
delivering
the
ball
theyre
different
games
and
a

different
circumstances
penn
said
all
i
know
is
we
did
it

and
gold

games
are
often
won

lost
on
third
down
and
perhaps
the
bucs
have
finally
figured
that
out
their
62
percent
effort
8for13
sunday
was
a
dramatic
improvement
from
last
weeks
35
percent
result
many
of
the
conversions
came
late
in
the
bucs
final
five
possessions
they
were

you

kicked
kcs
wild

the

had
suspicions
that
kansas

chan
gaileyled
offense
might
try
unconventional
methods
tampa
bay
just
didnt
know
it
was
going
to
be
the
preferred
method
of
attack
the
chiefs
used
direct
snaps
to
running
backs
a
reverse
and
a
halfback
pass
on
their
way
to
taking
a
243
lead
we
expected
some
of
that
from

hes
got
a
history
of
being
very
creative
they
really
had
us
on
the
ropes
they
mixed
it
up
quite
well
they
had
a
unique
package
maybe
well
steal
a
few
of
those
ideas
next
week
two
highlight
plays
wr
mark
bradleys
37yard
touchdown
pass
to
qb
tyler
thigpen
off
a
reverse
and
a
direct
snap
to
rb
jamaal
charles
that
picked
up
16
yards
on
third
and
1
fumble
trouble

rb
earnest
graham
hasnt
had
a
propensity
for
fumbles
in
his
bucs
career
but
he
wont
soon
forget
his
two
coughups
against
kansas
city
in
271
touches
in
2007
when
he
had
his
heaviest
workload
graham
fumbled
once
that
wasnt
the
case
sunday
grahams
first
fumble
came
at
the
bucs
41
on
the
teams
first
play
from
scrimmage
the
gaffe
set
up
a
chiefs
touchdown
graham
fumbled
again
after
the
bucs
had
driven
60
yards
to
the
chiefs
7
in
the
fourth
quarter
he
lost
the
ball
on
a
hit
by
de
tamba
hali
with
s
jarrad
page
recovering
5
yards
into
the
end
zone
graham
wasnt
alone
rookie
clifton
smith
fumbled
inside
the
red
zone
too
after
making
a
catch
and
attempting
to
shake
a
tackler
those
are
terrible
plays
by
us
coach
jon
gruden
said
you
dont
want
to
make
a
habit
of
doing
that
we
have
to
do
a
much
better
job
but
gruden
didnt
hesitate
to
go
back
to
his
two
playmakers
after
their
turnovers
both
had
key
plays
on
the
tying
drive
late
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
biggest
thing
is
just
overcoming
adversity
he
said
youre
going
to
have
a
lot
of
ups
and
downs
thats
life
in
general
its
about
what
you
do
after
that
quick
hits

bucs

combined
for

gilmore

while

this

for

against

defense
this
season
keep
him
clean

for
the
fourth
time
this
season
the
bucs
didnt
allow
a
sack
sundays
achievement
was
notable
because
qb
jeff
garcia
attempted
43
passes
in
an
effort
to
rally
making
their
offense
predictable
i
thought
the
pass
protection
was
outstanding
coach
jon
gruden
said
lt
donald
penn
was
happy
with
the
effort
because
it
came
against
a
defensive
front
that
the
bucs
regard
highly
they
probably
are
underrated
he
said
of
the
chiefs
defense
theyre
a
good
defensive
line
we
executed
when
it
counted
and
thats
what
helped
us
come
out
on
top
the
bucs
werent
successful
in
giving
garcia
adequate
time
to
throw
late
in
last
weeks
loss
to
dallas
against
kansas
city
garcia
was
able
to
consider
multiple
options
before
delivering
the
ball
theyre
different
games
and
a
lot
different
circumstances
penn
said
all
i
know
is
we
did
it
when
it
counted
i
think
its
an
example
of
our
hungriness
its
determination
third
and
gold

games
are
often
won
and
lost
on
third
down
and
perhaps
the
bucs
have
finally
figured
that
out
their
62
percent
effort
8for13
sunday
was
a
dramatic
improvement
from
last
weeks
35
percent
result
many
of
the
conversions
came
late
in
the
bucs
final
five
possessions
they
were
4for5
on
third
downs
against
the
cowboys
it
felt
like
we
were
something
like
3for17
wr
ike
hilliard
said
if
you
do
that
all
year
you
dont
have
opportunities
when
you
dont
have
opportunities
you
usually
get
your
butt
kicked
kcs
wild
plays

the
bucs
had
suspicions
that
kansas
citys
chan
gaileyled
offense
might
try
unconventional
methods
tampa
bay
just
didnt
know
it
was
going
to
be
the
preferred
method
of
attack
the
chiefs
used
direct
snaps
to
running
backs
a
reverse
and
a
halfback
pass
on
their
way
to
taking
a
243
lead
we
expected
some
of
that
from
offensive
coordinator

gailey

its
not

anyone
will
suggest
bucs
rb
earnest
graham
should
be
playing
quarterback
after
the
first
touchdown
pass
of
his
career
sunday
but
the
play
was
big
nonetheless
graham
found
te
alex
smith
for
a
3yard
touchdown
on
a
halfback
pass
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
fruition
of
weeks
of
flirting
with
the
idea
of
using
the
play
we
tried
it
out
a
little
bit
earlier
in
the
season
but
never
called
it
smith
said
we
put
it
in
the
game
plan
this
week
because
we
thought
we
had
a
good
chance
for
it
it
was
a
great
call
and
a
great
throw
by
earnest
he
said
he
couldnt
really
see
me
so
he
just
put
it
in
the
vicinity
fortunately
the
defense
bit
pretty
hard
said
graham
it
worked
out
just
like
we
thought
we
have
a
million
plays
weve
just
never
used
that
one
the
call
was
indeed
a
savvy
one
the
bucs
had
just
created
a
turnover
with
s
tanard
jacksons
strip
and
recovery
and
the
bucs
had
first
and
goal
at
the
chiefs
3
it
looked
like
a
run
all
the
way
they
were
going
hard
after
the
run
smith
said
we
could
see
they
were
digging
their
cleats
in
there
fumble
trouble

won
three
division
titles
the
most
in
team
history
and
led
the
team
to
its
only
super
bowl
championship
its
hard
to
say
what
was
more
remarkable
about
clifton
smiths
97yard
kickoff
return
for
a
touchdown
in
the
second
quarter
was
it
the
feat
itself
which
featured
smith
darting
through
traffic
with
abandon
or
was
it
the
timing
for
coach
jon
gruden
the
answer
was
unequivocal
right
then
we
were
struggling
he
said
it
was
a
hot
day
and
it
was
not
going
well
that
gave
us
a
chance
clifton
gave
us
a
chance
and
gave
us
some
life
and
some
energy
facing
a
seemingly
insurmountable
243
deficit
and
the
offense
floundering
the
bucs
needed
a

got
more

that

pounds
of

aggression
and
gave
an
oral
shudder
i
dont
want
him
coming
at
me
recchi
said
im
glad
he
was
away
for
a
couple
of
years
the
timing
has
been
perfect
for
recchi
whose
first
season
with
tampa
bay
coincides
with
artyukhins
return
after
two
years
playing
in
his
native
russia
it
was
perfect
for
artyukhin
as
well
as
the
lightning
in
desperate
need
of
big
physical
bodies
settled
a
twoyear
contract
dispute
and
gave
the
right
wing
an
opportunity
to
succeed
he
was
a
differencemaker
in

victory
over

at

with

gamehigh
eight
shots
and
six
hits
and
the
winning
goal
in
the
eighth
round
of
the
shootout
hes
getting
more
confident
coach
barry
melrose
said
after
tampa
bays
third
straight
win
i
think
hes
starting
to
realize
what
we
want
out
of
him
and
hes
getting
rewarded
with
ice
time
for
the
way
hes
playing
artyukhin
25
who
during
the
summer
signed
a
twoyear
19million
deal
is
a
roughedged
work
in
progress
he
loves
carrying
the
puck
but
tends
to
lose
control
though
not
as
much
as
earlier
in
the
season
he
is
not
afraid
to
battle
for
pucks
and
get
to
the
net
as
he
improves
his
puck
control
which
will
translate
into
more
shots
it
would
seem
a
matter
of
time
before
he
starts
putting
some
in
the
net
most
notable
though
is
artyukhins
speed
and
fluidity
as
a
skater
it
doesnt
take
long
despite
a
seemingly
effortless
stride
for
him
to
build
up
a
head
of
steam
that
is
when
heads
need
to
be
up
because
artyukhin
will
hit
you
with
full
boardrattling
force
ill
tell
you
melrose
said
when
arty
goes
over
the
boards
guys
on
the
other
team
know
you
can
see
them
elbowing
each
other
they
dont
want
to
play
against
that
guy
and
thats
good
artyukhin
with

and
four
penalty
minutes
while
averaging

of
ice
time
on
a
line
with
recchi
and
jussi
jokinen
said
he
wants
to
be
a
complete
player
converting
his
first
nhl
shootout
opportunity
was
another
step
i
score
it
and
goals
will
come
so
it
was
real
important
for
me
said
artyukhin
who
had
four
goals
17
points
and
90
penalty
minutes
in
72
games
for
tampa
bay
in
200506
in
my
mind
i
feel
like
i
can
be
a
better
player
score
and
help
the
team
win
games
play
physical
i
feel
like
right
now
im
picking
up
my
game
because
the
coach
is
giving
our
line
more
ice
time
artyukhin
played
1602
against
ottawa
and
made
the
most
of
it
his
rinklong
rushes
jazzed
the
fans
but
even
artyukhin
admitted
they
too
often
ended
with
the
puck
rolling
off
his
stick
even
so
hes
getting
more
confident
with
the
puck
recchi
said
and
hes
starting
to
understand
the
concept
of
stops
and
starts
hes
so
big
and
strong
when
he
stops
and
starts
hes
going
to
be
much
more
effective

tallahassee
coach
bobby
bowden
cant
recall
losing
in
quite
the
same
fashion
as
saturdays
threepointer
at
georgia
tech
a
fumble
near
the
goal
line
in
the
final
minute
i
guess
if
you
live
long
enough
everything
will
happen
he
said
sunday
thats
the
first
time
weve
lost
one
like
that
oh
sure
his
seminoles
have
misfired
on
lastminute
field
goals
and
there
was
the
night
in
1995
at
virginia
when
warrick
dunn
was
stopped
just
short
of
the
winning
touchdown
not
the
same
this
one
he
said
would
have
been
one
of
the
best
comebacks
in
fsu
history
a
masterpiece
perhaps
mentioned
with
the
1994
rally
from
28
down
to
tie
florida
in
the
choke
at
doak
and
the
1992
win
at
georgia
tech
the
challenge
now
is
getting
his
young
team
to
bounce
back
well
attack
it
positively
he
said
we
wont
let
them
feel
like
theyre
a
bunch
of
losers
in
his
mind
his
players
continued
to
fight
and
believe
that
despite
trailing
by
14
in
the
first
half
and
11
in
the
fourth
quarter
they
would
win
im
not
worried
about
their
attitude
he
said
ive
got
to
be
sure
we
coaches
do
a
sound
coaching
job
where
we
can
give
these
kids
every
opportunity
to
win
question
of
the
day
bowden
said
hes
confident
that
junior
fb
marcus
sims
who
was
hit
at
the
1yard
line
and
lost
the
ball
with
45
seconds
remaining
will
respond
positively
he
just
has
to
get
those
things
out
of
his
mind
he
said
you
watch
pro
football
it
happens
every
sunday
to
these
great
players
and
they
have
to
keep
playing
they
have
to
go
on
bowden
said
its
typical
that
young
running
backs
struggle
holding
on
to
the
ball
you
never
know
he
said
that
might
be
his
last
fumble
the
long
run
if
fsu
wins
one
more
and
becomes
bowl
eligible
only
one
of
the
iaa
wins
counts
for
that
it
will
take
over
as
the
program
with
the
longest
active
streak
for
bowl
berths
at
27
michigans
loss
saturday
ended
its
streak
at
33
years
who
would
have
suspected
that
i
wouldnt
have
thought
that
but
anyway
it
did
happen
bowden
said
theyll
get
it
back
and
we
have
to
keep
fighting
hard
so
we
can
maintain
this
streak

ourselves

we
got
a
field
goal
at
the
end
of
the
half
we
just
have
a
lot
of
veteran
leadership
weve
got
a
lot
of
guys
who
love
the
game
and
believe
in
what
were
doing
and
they
know
that
kansas
city
made
some
great
plays
and
they
knew
they
had
to
make
a
few
of
their
own
to
get
right
back
in
the
game
they
had
a
lot
of
poise
weve
got
a
long
way
to
go
but
to
win
six
games
before
the
bye
with
the
amount
of
guys
weve
had
play
for
us
is
a
great
accomplishment
were
going
to
build
off
this
on
how
far
a
win
like
this
can
carry
a
team
its
a
hard
league
to
win
in
you
know
that
to
be
63
and
alive
and
have
a
chance
to
regroup
and
get
some
guys
back
is
exciting
it
doesnt
guarantee
us
anything
weve
got
to
play
better
than
we
did
today
and
last
week
but
we
do
have
character
and
we
are
in
the
race
and
thats
significant
on
getting
deep
plays
from
receivers
especially
on
third
down
antonio
bryant
played
great
he
made
a
touchdown
catch
he
made
a
catch
earlier
on
our
sideline
made
unbelievable
catches
its
a
credit
to
our
guys
ill
try
to
get
joey
galloway
more
work
after
the
bye

the
chiefs
herm
edwards
on
mistakes
by
his
players
the
problem
was
we
lost
our
starting
nickel
corner
and
our
nickel
back
we
had
two
young
guys
in
there
and
one
of
them
was
cut
earlier
and
we
brought
him
back
this
week
and
he
had
to
play
a
lot
no
fault
of
his
but
he
had
to
go
play
maurice
leggett
had
to
play
a
lot
because
brandon
flowers
went
down
we
tried
to
hide
him
as
much
as
we
could
but
they
found
him
and
completed
some
passes
that
way
on
bucs
qb
jeff
garcia
he
got
into
rhythm
and
tacking
is
the
key
with
these
guys
because
they
run
a
lot
of
crossing
routes
they
put
the
ball
inside
the
numbers
for
the
most
part
he
did
a
good
job
of
getting
guys
open
they
made
some
plays
at
the
end
of
the
game
they
got
it
going
and
we
didnt
slow
them
down
on
the
pass
interference
call
against
tony
gonzalez
well
look
at
it
but
its
a
bangbang
play
and
is
something
not
for
instant
replay
the
official
made
the
call
and
tony
made
a
great
catch
if
we
get
that
catch
the
game
is
probably
over
on
the
pass
play
from
wr
mark
bradley
to
qb
tyler
thigpen
we
practiced
it
this
week
actually
thigpen
dropped
it
in
practice
and
then
we
came
back
the
next
day
to
make
sure
he
wasnt
going
to
drop
it
we
moved
it
back
a
little
farther
the
one
we
did
in
practice
he
was
standing
in
the
end
zone
mark
threw
a
good
ball
london
if
sen
john
mccain
thinks
the
american
media
have
treated
him
unkindly
he
ought
to
see
how
he
has
fared
in
the
british
press
the
day
after
his
final
presidential
debate
with
sen
barack
obama
british
papers
gave
huge
play
to
what
must
have
been
the
years
most
unattractive
photo
of
mccain
a
closeup
shot
of
him
with
tongue
hanging
out
as
if
he
were
about
to
gag
or
throw
up
in
fact
it
was
a
simple
expression
of
frustration
as
mccain
realized
he
was
heading
the
wrong
way
to
shake
the
moderators
hand
but
it
was
a
pictorial
metaphor
for
how
millions
of
people
worldwide
regard
the
thought
of
another
four
years
of
republicans
in
the
white
house
if
everyone
on
earth
could
vote
in
tuesdays
election
obama
would
win
in
a
landslide
according
to
an
online
poll
by
the
economist
the
respected
london
weekly
with
a
global
circulation
in
a
play
on
those
redstate
bluestate
maps
so
familiar
to
american
tv
viewers
the
magazine
has
divided
the
world
into
red
countries
mccain
supporters
and
blue
countries
obama
with
the
latter
so
overwhelming
in
number
as
to
make
a
global
map
appear
almost
entirely
blue
wwweconomistcomvote2008
the
economist
which
has
supported
both
republicans
and
democrats
in
the
past
said
it
would
vote
for
obama
if
it
could
the
democratic
candidate
has
clearly
shown
that
he
offers
the
better
chance
of
restoring
americas
selfconfidence
the
magazine
said
given
mr
obamas
inexperience
the
lack
of
clarity
about
some
of
his
beliefs
and
the
prospect
of
a
stridently
democratic
congress
voting
for
him
is
a
risk
yet
it
is
one
america
should
take
given
the
steep
road
ahead
if
the
united
states
has
one
ally
it
can
wholeheartedly
count
on
it
is
britain
former
prime
minister
tony
blair
was
so
supportive
of
president
bushs
decision
to
invade
iraq
that
critics
called
him
bushs
poodle
but
many
britons
feel
their
countrys
image
has
been
tarred
by
close
association
with
a
republican
administration
widely
condemned
for
abu
ghraib
guantanamo
and
other
perceived
abuses
of
power
in
2004
the
guardian
newspaper
was
so
aghast
at
the
idea
of
bushs
reelection
that
its
readers
sent
letters
to
14000
clark
county
ohio
residents
urging
them
to
vote
for
john
kerry
it
backfired
the
swing
county
went
for
bush
britains
current
prime
minister
gordon
brown
got
off
to
a
rocky
start
but
has
improved
his
own
ratings
by
distancing
himself
from
the
unpopular
us
president
many
commentators
who
slammed
brown
as
a
failure
just
a
few
months
ago
now
call
him
a
hero
for
upstaging
the
bush
administration
in
dealing
with
the
global
financial
crisis
they
gleefully
note
that
the
administration
meekly
followed
suit
after
brown
pumped
money
directly
into
beleaguered
banks
seen
as
a
smarter
approach
than
the
convoluted
us
plan
to
buy
up
mortgagebacked
securities
better
regarded
than
bush
mccain
is
generally
viewed
by
britons
as
brave
and
honorable
but
also
cranky
and
shorttempered
with
the
economy
the
no
1
global
issue
his
bumbled
attempt
to
take
leadership
of
the
us
bailout
plan
made
him
seem
all
at
sea
emitting
panic
and
indecision
the
economist
said
and
mccain
doesnt
fare
much
better
on
foreign
policy
despite
britains
own
experiences
with
islamic
extremism
the
2005
london
bombings
the
foiled
2006
plot
to
blow
up
usbound
airliners
in
a
country
that
has
suffered
significant
casualties
in
iraq
mccain
is
seen
as
too
eager
to
exert
us
power
abroad
on
the
other
hand
many
britons
are
genuinely
excited
about
obama
one
reason
is
that
britain
like
america
has
an
everincreasing
nonwhite
population
with
an
obama
presidency
a
generation
of
black
children
would
grow
up
with
a
different
sense
of
what
was
achievable

there
will

about
anything
other
than
how
we
prepare

win
and
how
we
prepare

said
immediately
after

that
hes
not
concerned
about
complacency
were
going
to
do
what
weve
got
to
do
and
the
way
we
keep
guys
focused
around
florida
is
we
practice
really
hard
meyer
said
those

every

we
battle

defensively
speaking
bigtime
defensive
plays
set
up
several
touchdowns
against
georgia
considered
the
gators
weak
link
entering
the
season
the
defense
is
ranked
no
5
nationally
in
scoring
allowing
116
points
per
game
and
no
13
in
rushing
1031
yards
the
gators
have
not
allowed
a
rushing
touchdown
in
two
games
and
they
are
tied
for

nationally
with
four
interceptions
returned

florida
has
had
at

one
interception
in

the

margin
leads
the
nation
talking
about
our
defense
last
year
soft
was
a
very
accurate
statement
dt
terron
sanders
said
but
if
you
look
at
us
this
year
its
a
complete
turnaround
we
have
more
experience
and
everybody
is
playing
their
part
the
way
we
look
at
it
especially
when
we
rotate
the
dline
everybody
is
a
starter
its
not
like
im
no
2
and
i
just
have
to
do
enough
until
no
1
returns
everybody
goes
out
and
thinks
they
are

he
seemed
a
dead
man
running
yesterday
morning
seven
seconds
behind
abderrahim
goumri
with
little
more
than
a
mile
to
go
but
marilson
gomes
dos
santos
has
been
around
the
block
here
a
few
times
and
he
figured
there
still
was
plenty
of
sidewalk
left
for
a
final
charge
i
have
seen
many
marathons
that
are
decided
in
the
last
minute
gomes
said
so
i
never
lose
hope
so
the
brazilian
kept
pushing
along
central
park
south
he
passed
the
flagging
moroccan
and
won
his
second
new
york
city
marathon
in
three
years
with
a
time
of
2
hours
8
minutes
43
seconds
his
24second
margin
providing
one
of
the
most
remarkable
reversals
in
major
marathon
history
i
proved
it
wasnt
luck
when
i
won
the
first
time
said
the
31yearold
gomes
who
in
2006
outran
five
kenyans
and
the
olympic
champion
but
was
eighth
last
year
though
abdi
abdirahmans
dream
of
becoming
the
first
us
mens
winner
in
26
years
dissolved
on
first
avenue
after
hed
struggled
with
a
side
stitch
for
4
miles
it
still
was
a
creditable
day
for
the
homeboys
there
were
four
american
men
in
the
top
10
for
the
first
time
since

had
a
walk
in
the
park
winning
her
third
title
in
five
years
by
finishing
in
22356
she
crossed
1
minute
47
seconds
ahead
of
russias
ludmila
petrova
with
kara
goucher
a
startling
third
in
22553
the
best
womens
marathon
debut
by
a
domestic
runner
and
the
fastest
time
here
by
an
american
and
the
first
podium
finish
since
anne
marie
letko
in
1994
as
much
as
i
was
hurting
the
last
5
miles
it
was
awesome
said
the
30yearold
goucher
who
was
born
in
queens
and
whose
father
was
killed
here
by
a
drunk
driver
in
1982
ill
be
back
for
sure
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
three
victories
that
radcliffe
wasnt
pushed
all
the
way
into
central
park
in
2004
when
she
also
was
coming
off
a
disappointing
olympics
radcliffe
had
to
outkick
kenyas
susan
chepkemei
by
three
seconds
in
the
closest
womens
finish
in
race
history
last
year
though
she
won
by
23
seconds
radcliffe
didnt
shed
ethiopias
gete
wami
until
the
final
400
meters
this
time
the
world
recordholder
ran
alone
for
the
final
4
miles
posting
the
biggest
victory
margin
in
nine
years
it
was
nice
to
win
it
different
this
year
said
the
34yearold
radcliffe
make
it
a
bit
easier
on
my
husband
and
the
others
radcliffe
became
the
only
woman
other
than
ninetime
victor
grete
waitz
to
win
three
times
here
and
now
is
8
for
8
in
marathons
not
held
at
olympus
radcliffe
always
a
frontrunner
ran
alone
even
when
she
had
company
rarely
looking
back
to
see
who
might
be
on
her
heels
nobody
else
wanted
to
lead
into
the
wind
she
said
everyone
was
in
single
file
behind
me
i
thought
cmon
youve
got
the
whole
road
as
radcliffe
cranked
up
the
pace
after
the
queensboro
bridge
her
pursuers
dropped
off
one
by
one

boston
champion
dire
tune
wami
olympic
silver
medalist
catherine
ndereba
and
former
boston
victor
rita
jeptoo
at
18
miles
only
goucher
and
the
40yearold
petrova
still
were
with
her
and
not
for
much
longer
she
just
hammered
us
from
about
8
miles
to
go
said
goucher
who
finished
out
of
the
medals
in
both
the
5000
and
10000
meters
in
beijing
and
never
had
run
longer
than
a
half
marathon
as
soon
as
she
came
out
of
the
bronx
and
back
into
manhattan
radcliffe
took
it
up
a
gear
gaining
12
seconds
on
petrova
between
the
21st
and
22
miles
and
another
22
seconds
by
the
23d
mile
from
there
it
was
a
fun
run
gomes
whod
won
here
two
years
ago
by
boldly
busting
a
move
on
first
avenue
had
no
such
luxury
yesterday
after
the
pack
broke
up
going
through
east
harlem
gomes
and
goumri
ran
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
and
out
of
the
bronx
until
the
moroccan
broke
away
with
4
miles
to
go
he
led
by
three
seconds
with
3
miles
by
five
with
2
miles
by
nine
its
my
day
thought
goumri
who
was
outkicked
by
kenyas
martin
lel
last
year
but
goumri
whod
been
missing
water
stations
was
running
on
fumes
and
gomes
began
closing
before
they
came
out
of
the
park
by
the
time
they
went
back
in
for
the
final
time
gomes
was
long
gone
it
was
the
third
time
in
two
years
that
goumri
had
finished
second
in
a
major
marathon
but
he
was
philosophical
about
it
i
should
win
one
day
no
problem
he
said
gomes
has
done
it
twice
here
now
and
he
knows
its
about
going
the
distance

the
full
distance
in
the
marathon
you
know
youve
won
the
race
when
you
cross
the
finish
line
he
said
not
before
yesterdays
biggest
winner
didnt
even
race
germanys
irina
mikitenko
claimed
the
world
marathon
majors
womens
title
and
the
500000
payout
after
the
five
race
directors
declared
her
the
victor
by
breaking
a
tie
with
wami
last
years
champion
it
is
a
dream
come
true
for
me
said
mikitenko
who
won
in
london
and
berlin
this
year
and
was
second
in
berlin
last
year
it
was
a
good
two
years
lel
who
withdrew
from
yesterdays
race
after
breaking
his
foot
in
the
lisbon
half
marathon
already
had
wrapped
up
the
mens
title
by
21
points
ahead
of
kenyas
robert
cheruiyot
last
years
winner
had
wami
finished
first
or
second
she
would
have
won
the
title
by
improving
on
her
thirdplace
finish
in
london
last
spring
when
she
placed
sixth
she
ended
tied
with
mikitenko
with
65
points
since
they
were
tied
in
headtohead
results
at
one
apiece
the
directors
unanimously
chose
mikitenko
based
on
her
scoring
her
points
in
three
races
to
wamis
four
and
her
better
average
time
electing
not
to
split
the
jackpot
wed
always
rather
see
it
come
down
to
the
playing
field
said
new
york
director
mary
wittenberg
mikitenko
who
chose
not
to
race
here
after
her
berlin
triumph

running
the
traps
on
a
phrase
in
the
air
sometimes
a
phrase
is
around
so
much
it
hardly
gets
noticed
lexicographic
research
shrugs
it
off
either
as
a
nonce
term

here
today
gone
tomorrow

or
something
that
has
been
around
so
long
that
it
needs
no
examination
or
explanation
so
it
is
with
lets
do
this
youve
heard
it
a
thousand
times
when
someone
asks
helplessly
whatll
we
do
your
reply
goes
lets
do
this
and
you
show
the
way
ah
but
what
happens
to
the
phrases
meaning
when
the
emphasis
shifts
to
lets
do
this
the
gentle
instructive
changes
to
the
strong
imperative
its
a
whole
new
ballgame
i
follow
common
usage
in
dispensing
with
the
adverb
wholly
because
of
confusion
with
its
homonym
holy
i
ran
the
traps
as
the
hunters
say
on
the
emphasis
shift
in
this
phrase
with
my
favorite
etymological
sources
and
got
a
series
of
shrugs
and
eye
rolls
because
the
phrase
as
written
rather
than
spoken
is
too
commonplace
but
joe
pickett
editor
at
the
american
heritage
dictionary
tracked
down
an
early
usage
of
the
shifted
stress
in
a
violent
song
by
the
heavymetal
band
korn
titled
lets
do
this
now
and
noted
that
its
the
doing
that
is
stressed
not
the
thing
itself
and
while
it
anticipates
future
action
the
expression
functions
as
a
clincher
that
was
the
meaning
picked
up
by
television
advertising
copywriters
in
scenes
dramatizing
creative
work
in
boardrooms
an
executive
asks
for
ideas
fixes
on
one
tossed
out
by
a
lowpaid
minion
stands
up
and
snaps
to
his
colleagues
with
the
voice
of
authority
lets
do
this
we
saw
it
during
the
late
political
campaign
when
sarah
palin
was
asked
by
sean
hannity
of
fox
news
for
the
reaction
of
her
daughters
to
her
coming
campaign
the
governor
said
she
asked
the
girls
what
they
thought
and
theyre
like
absolutely
lets
do
this
mom

the
use
of
theyre
like
rather
than
they
said
reflects
a
current
dismissal
of
the
dull
verb
said
i
used
a
variation
above
as
your
reply
goes
rather
than
is
to
demonstrate
withitness
turn
now
to
the
defiantly
unexpurgated
urban
dictionary
a
downanddirty
repository
of
what
the
pioneer
slanguist
francis
grose
in
his
1811
dictionary
called
the
vulgar
tongue
todays
urban
meaning
street
web
site
defines
the
new
phase
of
the
phrase
as
commonly
said
by
uppity
groups
of
people
but
also
those
ready
to

just
get
down
to
business
i
primly
bowdlerize
a
second
sense
usually
said
before
a
fight
or
when
an
event
is
about
to
go
down
you
are
wanting
to
be
part
of
this
event
here
is
a
vogue
phrase
in
which
punctuation
marks
define
meaning
if
lets
do
this
is
followed
by
a
colon
it
coolly
suggests
a
specific
course
be
taken
together
if
the
phrase
is
followed
by
an
exclamation
mark
its
a
command
to
get
moving
buster
or
get

final

this
used
to
be
a
football
metaphor

the
air
game
and
the
ground
game

but
the
military
metaphor
has
carried
the
field
infantry
footwear
has
been
slogging
though
mud
for
centuries
but
boots
on
the
ground
is
a
relatively
new
expression
earliest
citation
that
matthew
seelinger
chief
historian
of
the
army
historical
foundation
can
find
is
in
an
april
11
1980
article
in
the
christian
science
monitor
during
the
iranian
hostage
crisis
plans
for
a
rescue
operation1
were
made
in
the
carter
administration
and
there
were
worries
that
the
soviet
union
would
intervene
many
american
strategists
now
argue
that
even
light
token
us
land
forces

getting
us
combat
boots
on
the
ground


as
the
fourstar
general
volney
warner
put
it

would
signal
to
an
enemy
that
the
us

can
only
be
dislodged
at
the
risk
of
war
the
vivid
figure
of
speech
soon
triumphed
over
the
formal
infantry
in
the
field
the
word
boot
in
this
symbolism
does
not
stand
for
a
highankle
shoe
but
for
the
person
who
wears
it
in
1944
marine
inductees
were
called
boots
and
their
introduction
to
service
in
world
war
ii
was
in
boot
camp
as
mechanized
armor
air
and
naval
technology
advanced
the
role
of
the
foot
soldier

wearer
of
the
boot

was
sometimes
overshadowed
but
as
tr
fehrenbach
wrote
in
1963
about
the
korean
conflict
to
hold
a
position
you
must
do
this
on
the
ground
the
way
the
roman
legions
did
by
putting
your
young
men
in
the
mud
by
the
time
of
the
1991
operation
desert
storm
that
strategy
was
ascendant
although
air
and
sea
power
were
highly
important
a
war
could
not
be
decisively
won
and
territory
controlled
without
a
credible
component
of
armed
individual
human
beings
on
the
ground
throughout
2007
and
the
2008
presidential
campaign
focus
was
on
timetables
or
benchmarks
for
ultimate
withdrawal
of
us
boots
from
iraq
however
candidates
in
both
political
camps
military
metaphors
are
common
in
politics
agreed
on
the
need
for
additional
brigades
of
us
combat
troops
to
suppress
a
rising
threat
in
afghanistan
in
time
defense
and
diplomatic
officials
responsible
for
national
security
in
the
incoming
administration
will
face
a
question
framed
in
a
phrase
with
historical
echoes
will
there
be
a
need
for
more
or
fewer
boots

the

was
a

mainland
chinese
official
to
visit
taiwan
since
the
end
of

the
head
of

for

strait
landed

to
a

talks
are

meets
with
chiang
pinkung
the
chairman
of
the
straits

foundation
the
main
negotiating
body
for

the
step
is
not
easy
and
is
a
crystallization
of
the
joint
efforts
of
many
compatriots
across

chen
said
according
to
xinhua
mainland
chinas
staterun
news
agency
the
negotiating
bodies
for
the
two

met
in
june
in
beijing
after
a
long
hiatus
and
signed
a
deal
to
start
regular
weekend
charter
flights
between
mainland

the
meeting
took
place
shortly
after
the
inauguration
of
president
ma
yingjeou
of
taiwan
who
was
elected
last
march
after
promising
to
improve
both
the
economy
and
relations
with
the
mainland
but
mas
popularity
has
sagged
in
recent
months

taiwans
economic
performance
has
been
lackluster
and
many
taiwanese
citizens
say
ma
and
his
party
the
kuomintang
or
kmt
are
moving
taiwan
into
mainland
chinas
orbit
too
quickly

the
main

have
been
fierce
on

to

chens
motorcade
and
800
policemen
have
been
posted
to
the
grand
hotel
the
news
service
reported
the
chinese
communist
party
sees
taiwan
as
a
rebel
province
that
split
from
china
in
1949
when
the
kmt
sought
refuge
on
the
island
after
losing
the
chinese
civil
war
and
must
be
brought
back
into
the
fold
many
taiwanese
prefer
to
maintain
the
current
status
quo
of
de
facto
independence
and
some
especially
members
of
the
dpp
advocate
formal
independence
the
former
president
chen
shuibian
the
first
dpp
member
to
hold
that
office
tried
moving
the
island
closer
to
independence
chen
the
mainland
negotiator
and
chiang
are
expected
to
sign
agreements
that
increase
the
charter
flight
schedule
to
every
other
day
and
open
maritime
shipping
lanes
they
are
also
expected
to
discuss
economic
cooperation
as
a
way
to
fight
the
global
financial
crisis
it
is
imperative
that
the
two
sides
join
to
help
each
other
to
cope
chen
said
on
monday
according
to
xinhua
chen
has
also
said
the
mainland
is
again
offering
to
give
two
pandas
to
taiwan
a
move
that
the
beijing
government
first
made
in
2005
but
that
was
rejected
by
the
former
taiwanese
president
ma
has
indicated
he
would
accept
the
pandas
there
is
rampant
speculation
in
both
china
and
taiwan
over
whether
chen
and
ma
will
meet
if
so
the
big
question
is
will
chen
address
ma
as
zongtong
or
president
thus
acknowledging
that
ma
holds
a
title
that
in
international
affairs
is
usually
accorded
only
to
the

been
regularly
beating
up
for
fun
and
political
profit
through
two
terms
we
owe
much
of
our
awareness
of
whats
up
to
the
washington
post
which
at
the
gitgo
of
the
bush
presidency
gave
itself
the
largely
thankless
task
of
keeping
tabs
on
the
bureaucracy
where
much
of
the
governments
work
gets
done
without
public
notice
and
whose
mis
and
malfeasances
rarely
rock
the
news
cycle
even
when
they
are
exposed
what
will
we
do
for
such
knowledge
when
newspapers
grievously
ailing
die
off
the
blogs

and
other

arent

couldnt
afford
the

even

they

often
revel
only
in

thats

it
rests
perversely
with
the
bush
administrations
amazing
record
all
policy
matters
aside
of
plain
oldfashioned
incompetence
the
clinton
administration
had
rushed
through
regulations
that
had
been
in
the
works
for
years
so
late
in
the
day
that
the
requisite
period
to
secure
them
hadnt
expired
before

took

he
canceled
them
wholesale
on

day

the

fate

sent
out
a
memo
last
spring
urging
that
all
new
rules

regs
be
wrapped
up
by
november
1
but
this
is
an
administration
unable
to
learn
from
its
own
example
there
is
at
least
small
hope
in
the
fact
that
the

if

it
is
probably
going

be
a
good

for

but
if
mccain
wins
or
is
very
close
in
virginia
where
obama
has
had
a

it
could
be
evidence
that
polls
showing

a

said
the
effect
of
the

is
evident
in

of
declining

quality
this
is
going

continue

these
are
aimed
mainly
at
the
real
estate
and
construction
industries
now
is
the
time
that
a
financial
markets
crisis
is
being
transferred
to
the
real
sector
and
we
need
to
get
down
to
start
to
manage
the
situation
the
finance
minister
kang
mansoo
said
according
to
bloomberg
news
the
package
is
intended
to
bolster
growth
next
year
by
an
additional
percentage
point
to
around
4
percent
and
was
announced
as
fresh
data
showed
export
growth
had
slowed
to
its
lowest
level
in
13
months
in
october
economists
said
the
export
figures
were
also
likely
to
prompt
the
south
korean
central
bank
to
reduce
interest
rates
at
its
policy
meeting
on
friday
this
would
be
the
second
cut
in
two
weeks
after
last
weeks
surprise
cut
of
threequarters
of
a
percentage
point
weak
economic
data
in
australia
were
also
expected
prompt
that
countrys
central
bank
to
reduce
its
key
rate
by
another
half
a
percentage
point
to
55
percent
on
tuesday
the
cut
would
be
the
third
since
sept
3
and
bring
the
total
in
rate
cuts
to
175
percentage
points
the
moves
have
been
intended
to
prop
up
the
australian
economy
which
is
highly
dependent
on
raw
materials
production
and
has
suffered
from
falling
prices
for
iron
ore
and
copper
in
recent
months
data
out
on
monday
showed
retail
sales
fell
11
percent
in
september
much
more
than
had
been
expected
while
house
prices
fell
18
percent
during
the
third
quarter
china
which
last
week
joined
a
flurry
of
interest
rate
cuts
in
the
united
states
and
elsewhere
over
the
weekend
announced
it
was
loosening
limits
on
bank
lending
signs
in
china
also
indicate
that
growth
is
slowing
a
wave
of
violence
including
an
assassination
attempt
against
a
deputy
oil
minister
swept
through
baghdad
and
neighboring
diyala
province
on
monday
as
parliament
passed
a
bill
that
would
grant
the
countrys
embattled
minorities
fewer
guaranteed
seats
in
upcoming
elections
the
prospects
for
the
enactment
of
the
bill
which
must
still
be
approved
by
iraqs
executive
council
are
unclear
in
the
most
lethal
attack
of
the
day
six
people
were
killed
and
20
wounded
when
two
roadside
bombs
exploded
in
quick
succession
in
front
of
the
headquarters
of
the
ministry
of
interiors
criminal
investigations
unit
in
baghdads
central
karada
district
according
to
a
source
at
the
ministry
who
spoke
anonymously
because
he
was
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
the
deadliest
of
the
bombs
was
planted
in
front
of
the
protective
concrete
wall
ringing
the
government
building
the
other
was
about
70
yards
away
two
badly
burned
bodies
were
stretched
on
the
street
shortly
after
the
explosions
i
cannot
believe
what
happened
said
a
bewildered
policeman
at
the
scene
who
said
he
had
worked
for
the
directorate
for
35
years
who
can
plant
a
bomb
in
this
fortified
area
in
the
presence
of
police
patrols
the
assassination
attempt
on
the
deputy
oil
minister
came
about
30
minutes
before
the
karada
blasts
the
official
saheb
salman
qutub
was
wounded
along
with
his
driver
when
a
bomb
planted
in
his
car
exploded
according
to
a
ministry
spokesman
asem
jihad
the
attack
happened
as
qutub
was
getting
into
the
car
at
his
home
in
the
northern
baghdad
neighborhood
of
ataifiya
to
go
to
work
said
jihad
the
attack
happened
on
a
day
a
japanese
delegation
visited
the
ministry
to
discuss
investments
in
iraqs
lucrative
oil
and
gas
sectors
in
other
violence
monday
a
huge
car
bomb
exploded
in
a
parking
lot
next
to
the
headquarters
of
the
local
government
in
baquba
in
diyala
province
killing
at
least
three
and
wounding
13
eight
of
them
policemen
according
to
security
and
provincial
officials
the
blast
destroyed
22
vehicles
and
badly
damaged
several
government
buildings
located
nearby
ibrahim
bajlan
who
heads
the
diyala
provincial
council
said
that
the
attack
was
proof
that
the
situation
in
the
province
remained
fragile
and
that
the
governments
lauded
recent
security
operation
in
diyala
had
only
accomplished
a
fraction
of
its
goals
the
attacks
in
baghdad
and
baquba
came
one
day
after
american
and
iraqi
military
officials
said
that
overall
levels
of
violence
across
the
country
were
at
their
lowest
since
may
2004
in
a
move
that
could
stoke
further
tensions
between
iraqs
fractious
ethnic
and
sectarian
groups
parliament
voted
monday
in
favor
of
a
bill
that
would
guarantee
minorities
significantly
fewer
seats
on
provincial
councils
than
had
been
recommended
by
the
un
assistance
mission
for
iraq
the
bill
would
give
christians
a
single
seat
on
councils
in
baghdad
basra
and
nineveh
instead
of
the
three
seats
proposed
by
the
un
mission
in
each
of
baghdad
and
nineveh
the
yazidis
a
kurdishspeaking
minority
who
like
christians
have
been
reeling
from
attacks
and
displacement
since
the
start
of
the
war
in
2003
were
given
one
seat
in
nineveh
instead
of
the
three
proposed
the
new
bill
is
supposed
to
be
a
compromise
following
the
controversy
that
erupted
in
late
september
when
parliament
had
passed
a
new
provincial
election
law
but
deleted
an
article
that
had
provided
13
seats
in
six
provinces
for
iraqi
christians
yazidis
and
other
minorities
the
new
bill
grants
a
total
of
six
seats
the
un
mission
had
proposed
a
total
of
12
younadim
kanna
one
of
two
christians
in
parliament
called
mondays
vote
a
great
insult
there
is
no
desire
to
respect
minorities
as
the
indigenous
people
of
this
country
said
kanna
this
quota
is
simply
a
face
saving
mechanism
by
the
ruling
parties
no
matter
what
happens
with
the
possible
sale
or
breakup
of
chrysler
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
companys
marvelous
minivans
will
live
on
thats
because
whoever
buys
chrysler
if
indeed
it
is
sold
will
want
to
keep
the
companys
highly
profitable
minivan
business
chrysler
invented
the
modern
minivan
with
its
1983
introduction
of
the
dodge
caravan
and
plymouth
voyager
and
ever
since
the
company
has
dominated
this
segment
in
much
the
same
way
the
ford
f150
has
dominated
the
fullsize
pickup
class
the
chrysler
minivans
now
called
the
dodge
grand
caravan
and
chrysler
town
ampamp
country
have
been
taken
to
an
even
higher
level
that
competitors
will
find
hard
to
match
in
fact
general
motors
and
ford
have
given
up
on
the
minivan
segment
for
lack
of
a
product
that
can
come
close
to
the
current
models
in
the
chrysler
llc
minivan
lineup
sales
of
minivans
have
cooled
somewhat
since
the
arrival
of
suvs
and
now
crossover
utility
vehicles
but
the
segment
is
still
strong
accounting
for
nearly
a
million
units
sold
annually
the

but
they
lack

that
most

consumers
love
while
they
are
still

the
revised
exterior
styling
of
the
chrysler

gives
them
more
of
a
crossover
look
while

for
this

we

which
comes
with
the
base
33liter
v6
engine
and
a

are
the

to

from

all

to

but
our

came
with

a

with

the

swivel
to

the

there
is
a

so
the

can

another
great

from
the

nickelodeon
and
the

it
was
not
included
on
our
test
vehicle
but
i
have
seen
it
on
other
models
three
powertrain
options
are
available
beginning
with
the
ses
33liter
v6
rated
at
175
horsepower
and
205
footpounds
of
torque
this
engine
can
operate
on
e85
fuel
which
is
85
percent
ethanol
and
15
percent
gasoline
it
comes
only
with
the
fourspeed
automatic
standard
on
the
sxt
is
a
38liter
v6
which
offers
197
horsepower
and
230
footpounds
of
torque
it
comes
with
a
new
sixspeed
automatic
transmission
optional
is
a
40liter
v6
which
puts
out
251
horsepower
and
259
footpounds
of
torque
its
also
connected
to
a
sixspeed
automatic
oddly
the
biggest
engine
has
the
best
epa
rating

17
miles

city25
highway
while
our
se
model
with
the
base
engine
was
rated
at
17
city24
highway
the
midlevel
38liter
engine
is
rated
at
16
city23
highway
chrysler
made
some
improvements
to
the
40liter
engine
for
2009
that
boosted
its
fuel
economy
from
last
years
16
city23
highway
chrysler
should
offer
the
sixspeed
automatic
as
at
least
an
option
on
the
se
as
it
would
boost
highway
fuel
economy
to
above
that
of
the
sxt
with
the
40liter
engine
the
biggest
advantage
of
the
small
v6
is
the
price
rather
than
the
mileage
although
it
gets
just
1
mpg
less
on
the
highway
the
33liter
comes
in
a
vehicle
whose
overall
price
is
several
thousand
dollars
less
than
the
sxt
with
the
optional
40liter
v6
to
add
that
engine
to
the
sxt
costs
630
im
no
speed
demon
though
and
i
found
the
33liter
engine
to
be
adequate
for
my
needs
although
i
didnt
have
the
opportunity
to
load
the
grand
caravan
se
full
of
people
and
cargo
during
my
weeklong
test
with
a
full
load
one
of
the
larger
engines
would
offer
better
acceleration
and
more
hillclimbing
power
the
ride
and
handling
of
the
se
model
are
more
carlike
than
you
would
expect
for
a
boxy
peoplehauler
such
as
this
a
credit
to
the
engineering
changes
that
went
into
the
new
model
its
a
smooth
and
comfortable
ride
but
the
handling
is
surprisingly
crisp
the
van
also
is
very
quiet
inside
the

a
close
friend
of
president
bushs
is
trying
to
build
a
golf
course
in
northwestern
connecticut
many
residents
in
the
towns
of
norfolk
and
north
canaan
oppose
the
780acre
project
lamenting
its
effect
on
the
forests
meadows
and
trout
streams
in
their
corner
of
the
litchfield
hills
and
while
a
federal
agency
has
concluded
that
the
project
would
not
harm
the
habitat
of
a
turtle
on
the
governments
list
of
threatened
species
opponents
suspect

not
without
reason

that
the
decision
was
rushed
through
while
bush
is
still
in
office
the
developer
roland
betts
knows
bush
from
his
college
days
and
was
a
coowner
with
bush
of
the
texas
rangers
baseball
team
his
plan
would
draw
150000
gallons
a
day
of
groundwater
from
the
highland
site
wildlife
biologists
are
worried
that
this
loss
of
water
the
use
of
pesticides
on
the
golf
course
and
the
movement
of
480000
cubic
yards
of
soil
to
create
the
18
holes
could
make
bettss
land
and
surrounding
acreage
less
hospitable
to
bog
turtles
in
1998
a
connecticut
state
biologist
found
a
female
bog
turtle
on
land
near
but
not
on
bettss
property
in
july
a
consultant
hired
by
betts
filed
a
report
with
the
us
fish
and
wildlife
service
stating
he
could
find
no
bog
turtles
on
bettss
land
and
that
the
land
was
at
a
higher
elevation
than
the
turtles
usually
inhabit
even
though
fish
and
wildlife
officials
knew
that
consultants
for
project
opponents
were
on
the
verge
of
filing
their
own
report
the
officials
immediately
notified
the
us
army
corps
of
engineers
that
the
golf
course
presented
no
problems
with
regard
to
threatened
or
endangered
species
as
a
result
neither
fish
and
wildlife
nor
the
corps
weighed
the
report
of
the
opponents
consultants
which
found

not
surprisingly

that
wetlands
near
bettss
land
are
suitable
sites
for
the
turtle
especially
as
global
warming
makes
higher
elevations
more
to
their
liking
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
consultants
on
opposite
sides
of
an
issue
have
come
up
with
conflicting
findings
but
fish
and
wildlife
which
denies
there
was
pressure
for
a
quick
decision
should
have
considered
both
before
reaching
its
conclusion
the
endangered
species
act
requires
the
agency
to
use
the
best
scientific
data
available
in
making
decisions
to
abide
by
the
law
and
end
any
suspicion
that
betts
is
getting
special
treatment
from
his
buddy
in
the
oval
office
fish
and
wildlife
should
withdraw
its
finding
until
appointees
in
the
next
administration
have
a
chance
to
review
the
evidence

all
the
evidence
the
state
of
connecticut
for
its
part
should
freeze
consideration
of
the
project
until
the
turtle
question
gets
a
more
thorough
airing
the
number
of

homeless
families
are
staying
in
motels
caring
for
children
in
rooms
often
far
from
school
with
little
more
than
beds
a
tv
and
maybe
a
hotplate
given
the
faltering
economy
even
more
families
could
end
up
in
shelters
this
renewed
dependence
on
putting
homeless
families
in
temporary
quarters
represents
a
step
backward
for
massachusetts
especially
under
the
patrick
administration
the
state
had
sought
to
end
homelessness
by
2013
by
moving
people
out
of
shelters
and
toward
the
stability
of
economic
selfsufficiency
and
permanent
housing
while
the
number
of
households
falling
into
economic
jeopardy
will
test
the
states
ability
to
handle
each
case
in
a
comprehensive
way
this
farreaching
approach
remains
the
best
way
to
make
sure
families
stay
off
the
streets
in
the
long
term
shelter
alone
may
not
be
enough
to
keep
the
homeless
off
the
streets
what
they
may
really
need
is
help
paying
back
rent
finding
a
new
job
or
getting
treatment
for
an
addiction
and
families
who
are
already
in
shelters
need
help
moving
out
more
quickly
fortunately
massachusetts
is
still
working
on
transforming
its
homelessness
efforts
to
provide
the
right
resources
to
the
right
people
at
the
right
time
as
the
massachusetts
commission
to
end
homelessness
called
for
earlier
this
year
armed
with
10
million
in
state
funds
the
states
interagency
council
on
housing
and
homelessness
plans
to
start
a
sweeping
experiment
instead
of
automatic
placement
in
shelters
homeless
families
will
be
able
to
get
a
personalized
response
to
their
problems
this
might
be
a
short
shelter
stay
but
it
might
also
be
rent
money
or
a
referral
for
mental
health
counseling
some
of
the
interagency
councils
money
will
also
fund
job
training
state
officials
are
looking
for
private
funding
to
boost
this
effort
and
they
will
track
the
outcomes
and
figure
out
how
to
expand
the
programs
that
work
best
if
we
werent
doing
this
now
it
would
be
worse
robert
pulster
the
interagency
councils
executive
director
says
of
the
states
homelessness
problem
for
now
massachusetts
has
to
keep
its
shelters
open
to
cope
with
current
housing
emergencies
but
over
the
next
few
years
some
of
the
money
that
the
state
now
spends
on
shelters
should
be
shifted
to
programs
that
help
people
develop
the
skills
to
support
themselves
in
permanent
housing
the
states
overburdened
shelter
system
is
a
relic
that
has
to
give
way
to
more
modern
and
effective
solutions
in
his
new
position
as
head
of
the
us
central
command
gen
david
h
petraeus
met
top
pakistani
officials
for
the
first
time
monday
and
heard
one
message
wherever
he
turned
american
air
strikes
against
militants
in
the
tribal
areas
are
unhelpful
petraeus
the
former
commander
of
american
forces
in
iraq
arrived
in
pakistan
as
missile
strikes
from
drone
aircraft
against
the
taliban
and
alqaida
in
pakistans
tribal
areas
have
escalated
there
were
two
separate
missile
attacks
by
american
drones
on
saturday
in
retaliation
a
suicide
bomber
killed
eight
pakistani
paramilitary
soldiers
in
south
waziristan
sunday
after
the
meeting
with
petraeus
president
asif
ali
zardari
of
pakistan
said
in
a
statement
continuing
drone
attacks
on
our
territory
which
result
in
loss
of
precious
lives
and
property
are
counterproductive
and
difficult
to
explain
by
a
democratically
elected
government
it
is
creating
a
credibility
gap
there
was
no
comment
or
public
appearances
by
petraeus
and
it
was
not
clear
how
he
responded
to
the
complaints
messages
left
with
his
press
aides
were
not
immediately
returned
petraeus
who
has
been
consulting
in
recent
weeks
with
a
wide
range
of
people
on
the
efforts
by
the
pakistani
military
to
quell
the
insurgency
in
the
tribal
areas
and
on
the
deteriorating
situation
in
afghanistan
on
friday
took
over
central
command

putting
him
in
overall
charge
of
the
americanled
military
operations
in
both
iraq
and
afghanistan
the
generals
visit
came
as
the
pentagon
and
the
white
house
are
completing
reviews
on
policies
towards
afghanistan
and
as
sen
barack
obama
the
democratic
presidential
nominee
has
made
clear
that
pakistan
and
afghanistan
would
be
more
of
a
foreign
policy
focus
if
he
were
to
win
the
election
in
an
interview
on
cnn
broadcast
this
past
weekend
obama
said
he
believed
it
was
necessary
to
convince
pakistan
that
the
main
threat
to
its
security
came
from
the
militants
and
not
india
its
historical
enemy
during
his
round
of
calls
with
the
pakistani
government
monday
petraeus
met
with
the
commander
of
the
pakistani
military
gen
ashfaq
parvez
kayani
and
the
defense
minister
ahmad
mukhtar
the
american
missile
attacks
in
the
tribal
areas
were
generating
antiamerican
sentiments
and
creating
outrage
and
uproar
among
the
people
mukhtar
said
in
a
statement
a
senior
pakistani
military
official
said
the
army
wanted
to
bring
home
the
point
that
the
missile
strikes
are
counterproductive
and
that
this
is
driving
a
wedge
between
the
government
and
the
tribal
people
pakistani
officials
have
consistently
complained
about
the
air
strikes
that
have
been
aimed
at
arab
fighters
and
pakistani
militants
connected
to
alqaida
but
the
statements
against
the
air
strikes
have
been
couched
in
less
dramatic
language
than
kayanis
declaration
after
an
american
ground
raid
in
september
in
which
he
said
pakistan
would
defend
its
borders
at
all
costs
there
have
been
no
known
ground
raids
in
the
tribal
areas
since
on
a
more
positive
note
the
senior
pakistani
military
official
who
declined
to
be
identified
by
name
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
subject
said
that
the
united
states
had
started
to
listening
to
us
and
had
moved
towards
sealing
the
border
between
afghanistan
and
pakistan
in
the
area
of
bajaur
in
the
tribal
area
the
pakistani
army
is
fighting
taliban
militants
in
bajaur
and
has
criticized
the
united
states
for
what
it
says
is
the
failure
of
american
troops
in
afghanistan
to
stop
afghan
militants
crossing
into
bajaur
and
joining
the
battle
the
americans
had
moved
some
of
their
forces
to
the
east
of
the
kunar
river
last
week
and
this
had
helped
curb
the
flow
of
militants
into
bajaur
the
pakistani
military
official
said
it
is
bearing
positive
results
he
said
in
an
effort
to
show
petraeus
the
hard
terrain
that
the
pakistani
forces
face
against
the
insurgents
in
the
tribal
areas
the
military
planned
to
fly
him
over
some
of
the
terrain
tuesday
the
military
official
said
that
way
the
general
would
get
an
idea
of
the
long
porous
border
between
afghanistan
and
pakistan
we
will
let
him
see
where
the
roads
end
and
where
the
mountains
start
the
official
said
it
will
be
a
glimpse
of
the
tora
bora
from
the
other
side
he
said
referring
to
the
area
in
afghanistan
near
the
pakistani
border
from
where
osama
bin
laden
is
believed
to
have
escaped
from
american
troops
in
late
2001
during
a
visit
tuesday

is
fighting
in

a
long
delay

american

british
trainers

instructing
pakistani
officers
last
month
who
in
turn
will
train
the
frontier
corps
in
an
effort
to
turn
the
paramilitary
force
into
a
more
effective
group
of
indigenous
counterinsurgency
fighters
the
pakistani
military
officials
planned
to
ask
petraeus
for
help
in
increasing
the
armys
operational
capabilities
meaning
equipment
but
the
army
was
reluctant
to
accept
training
why
should
they
get
into
our
areas
the

asked

dianne
wilkerson
has
finally
given
up
her
campaign
to
retain
her
massachusetts
state
senate
seat
whether
or
not
the
senator
resigns
from
office
after
the
election
on
tuesday
she
will
soon
be
gone
but
the
effects
of
wilkersons
arrest
on
corruption
charges
will
linger
since
the
us
attorney
unsealed
documents
last
tuesday
neighborhood
activists
and
elected
officials
have
been
raking
over
their
past
dealings
with
the
senator
reassessing
them
in
the
context
of
the
bribery
allegations
a
blizzard
of
suspicions
has
blanketed
the
state
some
of
them
backed
up
by
federal
subpoenas
here
are
just
a
few
of
the
many
questions
raised
by
last
weeks
events
will
wilkerson
take
anybody
down
with
her
a
handful
of
city
and
state
politicians
have
been
drawn
into
the
morass
already
senate
president
therese
murray
mayor
thomas
menino
of
boston
and
others
have
denied
specific
charges
contained
in
the
fbi
affidavit
that
they
helped
deliver
the
liquor
license
for
which
wilkerson
allegedly
was
paid
handsomely
but
so
many
subpoenas
have
rained
down
upon
the
city
that
its
clear
there
will
be
more
casualties
what
is
the
real
deal
with
columbus
center
why
did
wilkerson
throw
herself
behind
the
controversial
and
nowstalled
project
with
such
passion
why
did
she
go
to
the
mat
again
and
again
to
get
support
and
public
subsidies
for
the
800
million
hotel
residential
and
retail
complex
over
the
massachusetts
turnpike
when
many
of
her
constituents
opposed
the
project
what
was
her
relationship
with
columbus
center
developer
arthur
winn
the
feds
are
quite
interested
in
answering
these
questions
themselves
apparently
winn
got
served
last
week
and
columbus
center
was
just
one
of
the
many
developments
in
which
wilkerson
took
an
interest
what
about
that
big
22story
dormitory
northeastern
university
is
building
on
the
corner
of
ruggles
and
tremont
streets
why
did
wilkerson
support
that
project
over
many
of
her
constituents
objections
that
it
was
far
too
big
and
that
the
school
had
not
provided
enough
benefits
to
the
community
in
return
for
the
right
to
bring
more
than
a
thousand
students
into
the
neighborhood
and
why
did
the
senator
oppose
other
northeastern
plans
to
expand
farther
into
her
district
a
year
later
was
she
acting
in
the
best
interests
of
her
constituents
or
was
she
really
working
to
help
one
of
the
many
developers
with
whom
she
had
close
relationships
the
same
question
could
be
asked
of
her
stances
on
other
projects
in
her
district

the
biolab
proposed
by
boston
university
for
example
which
she
backs
and
other
elected
officials
in
her
district
vehemently
oppose
maybe
her
dealings
on
these
and
other
development
proposals

and
she
had
a
say
in
many
of
them

were
on
the
up
and
up
maybe
she
supported
these
projects
for
the
jobs
theyd
bring
into
her
district
or
for
other
perfectly
good
reasons
but
wilkersons
alleged
willingness
to
take
bribes
to
subvert
the
legislative
process
in
the
interests
of
one
developer
in
roxbury
has
cast
suspicion
on
her
dealings
with
all
of
the
others
too
there
are
other
mysteries
what
about
that
6000
in
cash
wilkerson
was
carrying
when
she
was
arrested
on
tuesday
was
she
really
going
to
pay
personal
bills
with
it
as
her
lawyer
claimed
what
kind
of
bills
does
one
pay
with
six
grand
in
cash
anyway
while
were
at
it
what
did
the
senator
buy
with
the
23500
in
bribes
she
allegedly
collected
during
the
18month
fbi
sting
was
it
all
squandered
on
trips
to
foxwoods
like
the
one
described
in
the
affidavit
lastly
is
the
boston
licensing
board
really
the
easily
influenced
backroom
dealmaking
body
wilkerson
allegedly
describes
in
a
conversation
recorded
by
the
fbi
what
qualifications
do
you
need
to
be
paid
between
85000
and
100000
for
a
parttime
job
dispensing
the
coveted
right
to
sell
booze
beer
and
wine
do
you
have
to
be
politically
connected
or
does
anybody
have
a
shot

its

mass

the
day
tourists
have
vanished
the
summer
millionaires
have
retreated
and
parking
spaces
sit
vacant
for
hours
on
the
uncrowded
cobblestone
streets
but
something
new
this
offseason
is
staying
on
the
island
where
a
sign
in
the
town
clerks
office
reads
thank
you
for
not
discussing
the
outside
world
that
something
is
fear
planted
among
lifelong
islanders
by
two
horrific
rapes
in
which
an
intruder
still
at
large
walked
into
unlocked
homes
in
the
dead
of
night
in
the
first
crime
in
july
the
rapist
bound
his
victim
and
assaulted
her
for
several
terrifying
hours
the
second
rape
occurred
oct
5
the
rapes
are
the
most
prominent
crimes
in
a
surge
of
violence
that
has
startled
yearround
residents
on
this
small
island
in
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
the
number
of
sexual
assaults
reported
was
nearly
double
the
number
reported
in
all
of
2007
aggravated
assaults
surged
to
23
nearly
four
times
the
six
recorded
in
2007
and
100
simple
assaults
were
on
pace
to
outnumber
the
107
tallied
throughout
last
year
now
in
a
place
where
unlocked
doors
were
the
norm
residents
are
flocking
to
hardware
stores
for
locks
and
deadbolts
to
protect
themselves
it
was
almost
a
badge
of
courage
in
the
old
days
that
you
didnt
lock
your
doors
said
charles
tennant
hardware
manager
at
marine
home
center
all
of
a
sudden
were
getting
40
to
50
calls
a
week
at
valero
ampamp
sons
employee
ellie
huyser
said
the
locksmith
there
has
been
busy
with
about
20
jobs
a
week
its
good
for
business
said
huyser
a
lifelong
nantucket
resident
but
not
for
the
other
reasons
the
surge
in
crime
has
unnerved
an
island
that
has
long
burnished
an
image
as
a
placid
place
apart
buffered
from
the
pressures
and
influences
of
the
mainland
some
blame
the
economy
for
the
crime
wave
or
an
increase
in
alcohol
and
drug
problems
but
also
in
the
mix
many
say
is
a
massive
surge
in
population
largely
because
of
workers
who
come
for
summer
jobs
but
end
up
staying
without
showing
up
on
town
rolls
as
permanent
residents
nantucket
officials
say
that
10880
residents
are
recorded
in
nantucket
but
that
an
estimated
20000
people
are
living
on
the
island
straining
police
and
social
services
for
police
the
end
of
summer
used
to
signal
a
respite
from
the
fulltilt
pace
of
watching
over
an
island
packed
with
tourists
and
seasonal
residents
now
instead
of
slowing
down
its
literally
been
100
miles
per
hour
constantly
said
police
chief
william
pittman
town
clerk
catherine
stover
whose
family
dates
back
eight
generations
on
nantucket
began
locking
her
door
after
the
second

peter
swenson
who
directs
a
social
service
agency
here
recently
moved
with
his
wife
and
two
small
children
to
what
he
believes
is
a
safer
location
on
the
island
and
nikki
a
waitress
who
begins
work
before
dawn
said
she
has
started
locking
her
doors
and
windows
i
used
to
be
able
to
walk
to
work
with
a
flashlight
but
i
dont
do
that
anymore
nikki
said
now
i
take
a
cab
for
17
each
way
seriously
its
too
scary
in
other
violence
this
year
two
cyclists
were
beaten
and
robbed
at
night
on
a
bike
path
a
9yearold
specialneeds
child
allegedly
was
abducted
from
a
playground
by
a
landscaper
and
sexually
assaulted
in
his
truck
and
home
before
being
placed
on
a
bus
and
reports
of
domestic
violence
have
increased
across
a
broad
range
of

and

violence
swenson
executive
director
of

and
childrens
services
of
nantucket
sees
alcohol
as
a
continuing
factor
in
many
of
the
islands
problems
particularly
during
tough
economic
times
when
the
construction
industry
is
suffering
the
use
of
alcohol
and
other
drugs
has
increased
swenson
said
mix
that
with
stress
and
anxiety
and
you
tend
to
have
violent
actingout
swenson
said
his
staff
many
of
whom
are
women
now
always
leave
the
office
with
somebody
else
at
the
end
of
the
day
pittman
the
police
chief
said
there
have
been
fewer
total
arrests
this
year
but
he
acknowledged
that
there
has
been
a
surge
in
violent
highprofile
crime
although
the
reason
is
hard
to
pinpoint
pittman
agreed
that
nantucket
had
changed
in
the
four
years
he
has
worked
here
you
go
to
a
lot
of
neighborhoods
today
and
people
say
i
dont
know
who
lives
beside
me
anymore
pittman
said
over
and
over
in
interviews
across
the
island
residents
described
an
increasing
sense
of
vulnerability
and
alienation
exacerbated
by
the
population
increase
there
are
just
too
many
rats
in
the
cage
stover
said
of
nantucket
and
every
one
of
us
is
a
rat
as
they
have
for
decades
laborers
landscapers
and
workers
in
the
construction
trades
have
looked
to
nantucket
for
quick
money
and
entertainment
but
unlike
in
the
past
pittman
and
others
said
many
of
the
transients
are
putting
down
roots
and
staying
through
the
winter
a
large
percentage
of
them
are
foreign
nationals
from
salvadorans
to
bulgarians
to
irish
to
jamaicans
whose
presence
sometimes
has
caused
what
pittman
called
cultural
differences
and
misunderstandings
some
of
that
tension
results
in
imagined
threats
police
once
were
called
about
a
suspected
drug
deal
the
chief
said
when
the
reality
was
an
innocent
exchange
of
packaging
between
two
friends
in
another
incident
he
said
a
suspected
attempted
assault
was
actually
an
unexpected
encounter
between
a
young
cyclist
and
a
surprised
hispanic
laborer
youve
got
some
guy
sitting
in
the
bike
path

and
suddenly
the
cops
are
swooping
in
on
him
pittman
said
those
extra
residents
legal
and
otherwise
use
the
schools
seek
care
at
the
hospital
and
put
strains
on
other
municipal
services
that
nantucket
must
subsidize
if
people
are
here
they
deserve
services
stover
said
but
we
also
deserve
in
return
to
know
who
they
are
and
receive
state
and
federal
funding
for
those
services
in
the
meantime
police
are
pressing
their
investigation
of
the
rapes
which
pittman
believes
were
committed
by
the
same
person
and
as
his
officers
work
the
chief
said
he
understands
why
no
amount
of
reassurance
will
allay
the
fears
of
some
residents
we
proceed
as
if
that
suspect
is
still
among
us
pittman

in
a

nissan
said
for
the
past
15
years
need

has
helped
define
contemporary
automotive
culture
by
bridging
the
gap
between

and
the

keith
munro

is
definitely
a
car
made

fans
its
also
the
first
time
a
new
vehicle
can
be
driven
in
a

before
its
available
at

he
said
our

said

nissans
marketing
vice
president
by
launching
the
allnew
2009
nissan
z
first
through
need
for
speed
undercover
we
also

and
energy
that
ea
gamers
experience
so
strongly
together
with
ea
we
have
truly
integrated
the
allnew
370z
in
the
overall
game
experience
in
a
meaningful
multilayered
and
profound
way
eas
designers
worked
with
nissan
to
accurately
replicate
the
overall
look
feel
and
performance
of
the
new
z
the
automaker
said
adding
that
from
the
games
opening
moment
players
will
be
thrust
right
into
the
action
with
gamers
whipping
the
370z
in
and
out
of
traffic
at
high
speed
not
even
the
automotive
media
have
been
given
a
chance
to
drive
the
new
z
yet
but
a
few
of
us
were
treated
to
a
closeup
look
at
the
car
in
july
in
a
secure
futureproduct
vault
in
the
basement
of
nissans
new
100
million

building
near
nashville
tenn
that
sneak
preview
came
during
grand
opening
ceremonies
for
the
building
which
the
automaker
began
occupying
in
early
july
the
car
will
come
with
a
37liter
version
of
the
awardwinning
vq
engine
series
replacing
the
35liter
vq
engine
used
in
the
2008
model
the
current
350z
was
introduced
for
2003
as
the
fifth
generation
of
the
z
bringing
the
vehicle
back
to
the
nissan
lineup
after
a
nearly
sevenyear
absence
the
previous
generation
the
300zx
was
discontinued
in
1996
the
2009
370z
has
been
changed
enough
to
qualify
it
as
the
sixth
generation
and
the
new
engine
should
be
a
big
hit
with
z
enthusiasts
a
version
of
that
engine
was
introduced
last
year
to
power
the
new
infiniti
g37
coupe
and
has
been
added
to
the
g35
sedan
for
2009
forcing
it
to
be
renamed
the
g37
no
horsepower
rating
has
been
released
yet
for
the
engine
in
the
370z

but
in
the
2009
g37
coupe
its
rated
at
330
horsepower
in
the
g37
sedan
it
has
328
horsepower
a
sevenspeed
automatic
transmission
is
offered
as
an
option
on
the
09
g37
and
presumably
would
be
available
in
the
370z
as
well
the
2008
infiniti
g
models
have
a
sixspeed
automatic
which
is
carried
over
to
the
new
g
models
as
the
base
transmission
in
the
2008
model
of
the
350z
the
35liter
engine
is
rated
at
306
horsepower
the
only
transmissions
offered
are
a
sixspeed
manual
and
fivespeed
automatic
no
other
details
of
the
new

have
been
given

but
one
exterior

the
automaker
said
what
language
does
your

foreign
banks

soon
control
nearly
a
third

one
of
the
highest
ratios
of
any
state

that
could
lead
to
big

overseas

hinted
at
major

operations
including
citizens
bank
and
sovereign
bancorp
after
a
series
of
emergency
deals
cut
during
the

crisis
last

the
lack

has
some
local

jittery
the

reduce

said
the
test
now
is
whether
the
new
leaders
will
allow
citizens
and
sovereign
to
continue
to
lend
money
both
to
individuals
in
the
form
of
mortgages
or
home
equity
and
auto
loans
and
to
commercial
businesses
both
staples
of
citizens
and
sovereigns
businesses
to
date
so
far
so
good
say
some
business
representatives
like
brian
gilmore
executive
vice
president
of
the
trade
group
associated
industries
of
massachusetts
both
banks
have
told
him
theyre
looking
to
make
new
loans
he
said
and
so
far
companies
say
theyre
still
able
to
borrow
money
i
havent
heard
anyone
clamoring
for
lending
compared
to
what
i
heard
20
years
ago
when
we
were
all
sitting
on
our
doorstep
he
said
the
bigger
changes
may
be
for
other
banks
said
new
hampshire
bankers
association
president
jerry
little
such
as
if
a
foreign
owner
moves
to
replace
computer
systems
with
its
own
that
could
give
smaller
banks
the
chance
to
peel
away
some
of
its
customers
there
are
always
customers
who
get
a
little
frustrated
during
bank
mergers
even
because
of
simple
changes
like
having
to
get
new
checks
or
dealing
with
new
executives
he
said
the
challenge
to
these
institutions
is
to
pull
off
these
mergers
so
they
dont
lose
any
of
their

hester
included

among

called
very

hester
is
becoming
royal

chief
executive
as
part
of
a
deal
by
royal
bank
to
accept
an
infusion
from
the
british
government
as
part
of
a
64
billion
package
spread
among
three
banks
the
cash
comes
with
many
more
strings
than
similar
infusions
to
american
banks
from
washington
such
as
requirements
the
bank
continue
lending
at
2007
levels
a
citizens
spokeswoman
said
those
limits
dont
apply
to
the
domestic
bank
in
london
a
british
treasury
spokesman
said
commercial
decisions
such
as
whether
to
sell
assets
would
be
made
by
royal
bank
itself
meanwhile
santander
has
said
little
about
its
intentions
for
sovereign
in
which
it
had
already
purchased
a
25
percent
stake
three
years
ago
on
oct
13
it
disclosed
plans
to
buy
the
remaining
75
percent
for
19
billion
in
stock
ending
a
period
of
uncertainty
for
sovereign
after
it
saw
steep
customer
outflows
and
replaced
its
chief
executive
suddenly
in
september
santander
has
since
told
sovereign
employees
it
will
keep
incoming
chief
executive
paul
perrault
and
called
sovereign
an
attractive
entry
point
into
the
northeastern
us
market
it
has
also
made
references
to
costcutting
and
efficiencies
which
could
lead
to
job
cuts
at
the
least
the
sovereign
deal
seems
to
have
reassured
depositors
who
in
the
third
quarter
had
pulled
42
billion
out
of
the
institution
nearly
9
percent
of
its
deposits
sovereign
said
its
deposits
have
stabilized
and
stressed
a
similar
theme
in
newspaper
advertisements
it
began
running
last
week
about
new
owner

recently
i
walked
through
the
prudential
center
shopping
arcade
toward
boylston
street
and
passed
brentanos
bookstore
and
the
branch
office
of
my
bank
the
provident
institution
for
savings
no
wait
i
thought
this
is
2008

theyre
long
gone
down
on
the
sidewalk
i
looked
across
the
street
and
saw
the
bulkie
restaurant
cramer
electronics
pauls
mall
and
jazz
workshop
and
just
to
the
right
the
brodney
gallery
specializing
in
antique
jewelry
you
dont
see
them
right
i
know

theyre
gone
too
on
and
on
down
boylston
guild
drug
at
one
corner
of
exeter
street
and
bus
college
of
basic

on
the

at
copley
cokesbury

peck
ampamp
peck
the
book
clearing
house
and
thayer
mcneil
shoes
and
the
people
i
glance
up
exeter
street
to
no
88
and
see
in
memory
my
terribly
sick
father
sitting
in
a
lawn
chair
on
the
stoop
waiting
for
me
to
come
home
from
school
but
no
that
yellow
brick
house
is
a
marriott
boutique
hotel
we
hear
the
gloomy
voices
deplore
the
youngs
ignorance
of
history
and
we
think
and
worry
about
memory
loss
in
ourselves
and
loved
ones
but
another
curious
phenomenon
as
we
get
older

which
no
one
warns
us
about

is
the
tenacious
web
of
memory
for
objects
incidents
and
people
that
increasingly
surrounds
us
and
wont
leave
us
alone
especially
if
weve
lived
in
one
place
all
our
lives
everywhere
we
look
we
see
things
as
they
used
to
be
later
on
the
subway
not
called
the
red
line
just
the
ashmontharvard
line
i
board
the
greenish
old
train
with
windows
you
can
open
hold
overhead
the
white
porcelain
handle
and
see
in
the
dark
tunnel
the
reflected
face
of
a
pimply
adolescent
i
blink
and
the
face
is
deeply
furrowed
with
gray
whiskers
i
go
to
a
night
game
at
fenway
park
and
see
the
cloud
of
cigarette
smoke
rising
from
the
grandstand
against
the
lights
and
the
three
monks
wine
billboard
poking
up
beyond
center
field
and
hear
john
kiley
playing
the
organ
i
look
at
the
45
price
on
my
ticket
turn
to
the
younger
person
next
to
me
and
say
you
know
i
remember
when
bleacher
seats
were
1
the
grandstand
was
250
and
the
expensive
box
seats
were
5
he
looks
at
me
with
patient
indifference
and
says
oh
yeah
then
turns
back
to
watch
the
next
pitch
it
dawns
on
me
with
horror
that
i
sound
just
like
one
of
those
denizens
of
a
bygone
age
who
fastens
like
the
ancient
mariner
on
a
young
person
quite
sure
that
the
memories
rattling
around
in
his
brain
must
be
as
interesting
to
the
listener
as
they
are
to
him
he
doesnt
know
what
a
bore
he
is
the
listener
thinks
right
gramps
i
know

things
arent
the
way
they
used
to
be
often
we
are
interested
in
elders
memory
of
historic
events
that
were
curious
about
for
other
reasons
the
depression
say
or
world
war
ii

or
ted
williamss
last
home
run
i
was
fascinated
that
my
mother
remembered
the
world
war
i
victory
parade
on
beacon
street
and
the
north
end
molasses
flood
of
1919
which
killed
21
people
and
that
she
always
objected
when
it
was
treated
as
a
joke
it
was
not
funny
she
said
it
was
a
horror
the
smell
hung
in
the
streets
for
years
the
young
listener
is
right
of
course
the
next
pitch
is
what
matters
most
of
the
thicket
of
stuff
clogging
our
brains
is
of
no
importance
to
our
present
and
matters
not
a
bit
to
someone
else
it
interests
us
because
change
in
our
lives
is
a
proof
of
time
i
might
not
feel
much
different
from
my
past
self
but
if
that
orange
mta
sic
car
i
used
to
take
is
now
on
display
like
lenins
corpse
in
boylston
station
that
means
i
cant
be
that
far
from
a
shunt
myself
none
of
this
is
to
say
that
the
stuffed
scrapbook
of
the
past
is
ridiculous
to
add
and
hang
on
to
as
long
as
we
dont
yammer
on
about
the
details
theyre
just
part
of
who
we
are
and
they
give
a
gift
that
can
be
appreciated
such
as
when
we
look
at
an
old
movie
of
someone
like
84yearold
lauren
bacall
who
looks
every
bit
of
her
age
what
a
knockout
she
was
we
think
and
then
that
beauty
is
all
still
there

it
must
be
just
under
the
luggage

a

auto

down

now
the

crunch

uncertainty
about

with

down

consumers

returning

been
holding

that
bodes
well
for
the
camaro
when
it
arrives
in
the
first
quarter
of

but
fuel
economy
isnt
expected
to
be
an

it
was
the
success
of
the
newest
generation
of

for
2005
that
led
gm
to
revive
the

which
was
the
gm
answer
to
the
original

in
the
mid60s
for
its
part
dodge

muscle

this

also
a
response
to
the
retrostyled

while
the

borrow
heavily
from

1960s
predecessors
the

its
a
modern
interpretation
of
the

with
a
few
basic

this

also
has
some
styling
cues
from
the

as
well
as
from

talk
spiritedly
about
the
types
of
books
they
like
to
read
cowancummings
a
freshman
at

says
she
finds
most
of
the
literature
she
peruses
for
class
boring

is
suspicious
of

the

says
blocker
15
of
roxbury
so
the
three
teenagers
have
turned
to
the
very
adult
genre
of
urban
fiction
one
of
godfreys
favorites
is
the
coldest
winter
ever
by
activist
and
hiphop
star
sister
souljah
which
tells
the
story
of
the
privileged
daughter
of
a
brooklyn
drug
dealer
blocker
has
read
a
gangstas
girl
and
a
hood
chicks
story
tales
of
girls
who
get
caught
up
in
street
life
urban
fiction

also
known
as
street
lit
or
street
fiction

is
a
style
of
literature
that
depicts
drugs
violence
and
sexual
promiscuity
in
black
and
latino
neighborhoods
some
of
the
books
detail
the
extravagant
lifestyles
of
drug
dealers
others
describe
the
bloody
violence
associated
with
the
drug
trade
the
sex
scenes
in
some
of
the
novels
are
extremely
explicit
and
sex
is
often
used
as
a
form
of
power
rather
than
an
expression
of
love
the
genre
is
not
new
authors
such
as
donald
goines
and
iceberg
slim
began
writing
about
the
world
of
pimps
gangsters
and
drug
dealers
in
the
1970s
but
recently
a
younger
generation
of
writers
such
as
teri
woods
carl
weber
and
nikki
turner
have
begun
delving
into
urban
fiction
some
started
as
selfpublished
authors
who
sold
their
books
from
the
trunks
of
their
cars
the
books
quickly
won
great
acclaim
among
readers
allowing
the
new
authors
to
establish
independent
book
companies
and
ultimately
sign
deals
with
major
publishers
in
the
past
few
years
the
genre
has
exploded
in
popularity
according
to
nielsen
bookscan
only
4000
urban
fiction
novels
were
sold
in
2005
representing
02
percent
of
adult
fiction
book
sales
in
2007
urban
fiction
accounted
for
4
percent
of
the
adult
fiction
market
with
82000
copies
sold
from
the
genres
rebirth
it
has
experienced
scrutiny
and
controversy
the
books
initially
were
criticized
for
their
racy
sexual
content
as
well
as
their
spelling
and
grammatical
errors
as
more
teenagers
fall
under
the
spell
of
streetlit
novels
some
adults
worry
about
how
the
content
is
influencing
teenagers
but
teens
and
some
adults
insist
that
the
content
of
the
books
doesnt
change
mindsets
as
a
result
of
the
controversy
major
publishing
houses
have
released
youngadult
series
such
as
kimani
tru
bluford
and
hotlanta
for
teens
yearning
for
books
with
an
innercity
vibe
these
new
series
have
avoided
criticism
because
the
violence
or
drug
use
tends
to
be
mentioned
in
passing
rather
than
described
explicitly
the
tension
between
adults
and
teens
mirrors
the
dialogues
in
mainstream
pop

about
the
appropriateness
of

amy
pattee
an
assistant
professor
in
the
graduate
school
of
library
and
information
sciences
at
simmons
college
in
the
past
debates
have
developed
around
whether
young
people
should
read
jackie
collins
or
stephen
king
for
a
long
time
librarians
have
struggled
with
the
issue
of
kids
reading
grownup
books
pattee
says
there
are
certain
adult
books
that
we
consider
to
be
more
adult
than
others
pattee
says
she
doesnt
have
a
problem
with
teens
reading
urban
fiction
in
fact
she
wrote
a
positive
review
of

a

pattee
says
she
appreciates
the
social
commentary
in
books
such
as
nikki
turners
a
project

a
lot
of
these
books
point
out
the
ways
in
which
the

who
have
incredible
internal

pattee
says
denene
millner
and
mitzi
miller
launched
the
hotlanta
urban
series
for
teens
the
first
book
released
in
april
tells
the
story
of
two
rich
teens
whose
estranged
father
is
released
from
prison
ive
been
pretty
passionate
about
speaking
out
about
how
much
our
teenage
girls
love
to
read
but
how
inappropriate
the
material
is
thats
at
their
fingertips
millner
says
millners
14yearold
niece
had
read
the
gossip
girl
and
alist
series
but
yearned
for
books
with
characters
with
whom
she
could
identify
millners
niece
soon
turned
to
street
fiction
shes
been
reading
teri
woods
zane
millner
says
zane
writes
bestselling
erotic
novels
im
not
saying
theres
anything
wrong
with
zane
but
its
not
right
for
a
14yearold
child
to
read
that
work
felicia
cowan
the
mother
of
chanel
cowancummings
agrees
with
millner
to
an
extent
cowan
wont
let
her
daughter
read
zanes
sexually
explicit
novels
which
cowan
personally
peruses
by
being
a
handson
parent
cowan
says
she
limits
the
detrimental
effects
of
the
books
she
does
allow
chanel
to
read
such
as
eric
jerome
dickeys
romantic
novel
milk
in
my
coffee
cowan
is
open
about
the
harsh
realities
of
life
shes
answered
chanels
question
about
why
some
men
cheat

infidelity
is
a
perennial
theme
in
urban
fiction

but
cowan
also
makes
sure
that
she
knows
where
her
daughter
is
at
all
times
i
try
to
keep
it
on
the
level
that
i
dont
hide
everything
from
her
says
cowan
43
who
lives
in
roxbury
i
let
her
know
whats
real
i
try
to
keep
it
on
an
even
keel
if
its
too
grownup
for
her
no
you
cant
read
that
even
if
she
understands
whats
going
on
no
you
cant
read
that
yet

breanna
blocker
and
chanel

say
the
content
of
urban
fiction
books
doesnt
affect
them
its
not
taking
away
my
innocence
says
cowancummings
14
its
making
me
more
knowledgeable
about
whats
going
on
blocker
describes
an
encounter
she
and
cowancummings
had
that
day
blocker
was
wearing
a
yellow
bandana
around
her
neck
and
some
people
asked
her
if
she
was
a
member
of
the
latin
kings
a
gang
known
for
wearing
yellow
bandanas
for
blocker
the
incident
showed
how
relevant
the
content
of
urban
fiction
is
for
teens
living
in
certain
neighborhoods
the
same
things
that
are
happening
in
the
books
she
says
is
happening
in
boston
today
the
gang
violence
the
guns
the
drugs

in

recently
to
buy
a
gangsters
girl
and
me
and
my
boyfriend
both
deal
with
young
girls
who
fall
in
love
with
drug
dealers
the
bookstore
owner
leonard
egerton
doesnt
think
teens
should
read
those
books
i
have
some
integrity
he
says
i
dont
think
its
appropriate
to
sell
adult
literature
to
an
underage
person
but
egerton
says
he
also
realizes
that
theres
no
law
preventing
teenagers
from
buying
urban
fiction
and
that
he
cant
turn
his
personal
stance
into
store
policy

even
though
some
parents
have
berated
him
for
selling
the
books
to
their
teens
without
their
permission
pryce
ultimately
took
home
the
books
she
wanted
people
want
to
read
it
pryce
says
so
you
have

tulum
mexico

the
mayan
riviera
along
the
yucatan
peninsula
is
renowned
for
its
spectacular
beaches
stretching
from
the
increasingly
las
vegaslike
cancun
to
solitary
stretches
of
white
and
turquoise
to
the
south
but
in
the
beach
town
of
tulum
about
two
hours
south
of
cancun
a
new
kind
of
tourism
is
emerging
the
jungle
vacation
a
growing
number
of
developers
and
hoteliers
are
beginning
to
market
the
allure
of
the
areas
thick
jungle
home
to
mayan
villagers
mysterious
underground
pools
and
the
occasional
jaguar
pioneers
of
this
movement
into
the
jungle
are
mari
and
lou
pintkowski
a
colorado
couple
who
came
to
tulum
about
five
years
ago
with
the
familiar
dream
of
building
a
bed
and
breakfast
but
when
the
process
of
building
a
beachfront
hotel
turned
into
a
bureaucratic
nightmare
the
couple
moved
their
operations
into
the
jungle
town
of
macario
gomez
about
12
miles
from
the
beach
we
had
just
fallen
in
love
with
the
jungle
mari
pintkowski
remembered
it
was
so
peaceful
and
we
woke
up
every
morning
with
the
singing
of
the
birds
recently
my
wife
and
i
had
a
chance
to
stay
at
the
pintowskis
unique
la
selva
mariposa

they
call
it
an
elegant
jungle
bed
and
breakfast

and
see
for
ourselves
what
the
fuss
was
about
the
place
is
just
a
20minute
drive
from
tulum
and
another
20
minutes
from
the
spectacular
coba
ruins
where
centuriesold
mayan
temples
are
enshrouded
by
creeping
jungle
as
we
drove
down
an
unmarked
dirt
road
to
the
tiny
fourroom
bed
and
breakfast
i
quickly
realized
the
selva
mariposa
was
unlike
anything
ive
ever
seen
the
couple
has
fashioned
exquisitely
landscaped
pools
in
front
of
the
rooms
with
cool
transparent
water
from
nearby
underground
sources
a
hammock
hung
invitingly
over
our
pool
nestled
into
a
riot
of
colorful
vegetation
inside
our
room
was
made
of
luxurious
tzlam
and
cataloch
wood
cut
out
of
the
surrounding
jungle
and
cleverly
illuminated
mayan
sculptures
made
of
polished
limestone
the
bathroom
was
also
unique
with
an
openair
shower
in
the
mornings
we
could
look
up
and
see
the
sun
playing
off
the
jungle
canopy
and
got
a
few
mosquito
bites
in
the
process
a
hollowedout
tree
trunk
holding
a
living
fern
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
shower
we
were
also
reminded
that
despite
our
plush
surroundings
we
were
indeed
in
the
jungle

the
room
came
with
a
long
pickup
stick
to
grab
scorpions
luckily
we
never
had
to
use
it
but
we
made
sure
our
feet
were
shod
whenever
we
walked
around
the
room
beyond
the
explosion
of
interesting
plant
life
think
wildly
colored
orchids
and
fireorange
palms
the
best
part
of
the
jungle
are
the
sounds
at
dawn
and
dusk
the
hotel
was
overrun
by
local
birds
their
singing
and
warbling
mingling
with
the
occasional
cry
from
a
howler
monkey
and
once
the
sun
falls
the
air
fills
with
the
relaxing
hum
of
thousands
of
insects
but
being
in
tulum
we
couldnt
deprive
ourselves
of
the
water
cenotes
pronounced
senotays
are
underground
pools
of
water
that
were
worshiped
by
the
ancient
maya
who
saw
them
as
portals
to
the
afterlife
the
yucatan
is
virtually
riverless
and
cenotes
provide
drinking
water
as
well
as
diversion
the
result
of
rainwater
filtering
through
porous
limestone
one
of
the
most
breathtaking
is
the
grand
cenote
just
a
few
miles
from
the
hotel
on
the
modern
highway
to
tulum
in
a
huge
natural
cavern
snorklers
swam
through
crystal
clear
water
and
under
tunnels
covered
with
hanging
stalagmites
far
cooler
and
more
refreshing
than
the
ocean
the
cenote
was
filled
with
hundreds
of
small
fish
that
darted
between
our
legs
for
lunch
we
headed
into
downtown
tulum
which
has
a
decidedly
hippie
and
european
vibe
unlike
the
megaresorts
of
cancun
tulum
is
mostly
visited
by
younger
backpacker
types
staying
at
one
of
the
many
ecohotels
along
the
beach
most
generate
their
own
electricity
through
solar
and
wind
power
several
larger
resortstyle
places
have
moved
to
tulum
in
recent
years
but
are
embroiled
in
a
lengthy
legal
battle
with
the
government
over
environmental
laws
several
have
been
temporarily
shut
down
because
they
were
built
too
large
or
in
sensitive
areas
there
is
a
large
italian
population
in
the
mayan
riviera
and
as
an
extra
bonus
a
high
concentration
of
delicious
authentic
italian
restaurants
we
ate
at
la
nave
along
tulums
main
boulevard
and
feasted
a
calzone
the
size
of
a
small
television
and
an
impeccable
seafood
linguini
stuffed
with
fresh
shrimp
squid
and
octopus
it
would
be
criminal
to
leave
tulum
without
visiting
its
majestic
mayan
ruins
built
along
a
beachside
cliff
the
ruins
which
once
served
as
an
important
trading
hub
with
what
is
now
belize
and
guatemala
are
best
visited
early
in
the
morning
not
only
is
the
heat
less
oppressive
but
youll
avoid
bus
loads
of
tourists
even
though
we
visited
during
the
rainy
offseason
hordes
of
mostly
european
tourists
overran
the
place
theres
a
beach
within
the
ruins
where
you
can
bodysurf
among
ancient
temples
but
unfortunately
it
was
closed
because
of
high
surf
when
we
were
there
as
the
crowds
made
their
way
back
to
their
beachside
hotels
we
drove
back
into
the
jungle
and
considered
two
options
ride
a
zip
line
through
the
jungle
canopy
or
explore
the
ruins
in
coba
hanging
lazily
in
our
hammock
suspended
above
the
natural
pool
we
decided
that
nothing
beat

a
few
months
ago
in
a
cavernous
new
gallery
space
at
the
massachusetts
museum
of
contemporary
art
lacey
fekishazy
took
out
a
pencil
and
began
to
draw
on
a
white
wall
nobody
bothered
the
brooklyn
artist
after
all
she
was
doing
her
job
which
was
to
create
a
sol
lewitt
wall
drawing
the
subtitle

ten
thousand
lines
about
10
25cm
long
covering
the
wall
evenly

pretty
much
described
the
task
each
day
ruler
in
hand
fekishazy
added
to
the
piece
10
inches
at
a
time
i
have
drawn
5000
lines
she
wrote
on
a
sheet
of
scrap
paper
taped
nearby
after
four
days
of
work
when
it
was
over
after
day
eight
fekishazy
spoke
of
the
surprising
pleasure
she
took
from
the
process
which
rendered
the
wall
a
mesmerizing
sea
of
crosshatched
marks
i
found
it
really
meditative
and
calming
she
said
this
month
the
work
of
fekishazy
and
68
others
brought
in
by
mass
moca
last
summer
will
open
to
the
public
a
sprawling
unprecedented
retrospective
of
the
late
lewitts

drawings
this
105work
project
created
according
to
specifications
set
out
by
the
conceptual
master
covers
three

nearly
30000
square

four
decades
of

work
mass

building

formerly
an
abandoned

building
was
renovated
especially
for

exhibition
created
through
an
unorthodox
collaboration
with
the

williams
college
museum
of

and
lewitt
estate
will
remain
up
for
at
least
25
years
until
2033
for
lewitt
fans
the
project
serves
as
a
vast
embrace
of
the
artists
legacy
and
a
new
destination
for
a
walldrawing
pilgrimage
for
those
less
familiar
with
lewitt
the
installation
is
an
eyeopening
introduction
showcasing
the
dry
humor
of
some
of
his
early
pencil
drawings
the
pulsating
colors
of
his
later
paint
and
inkwash
creations
and
the
deceivingly
complex
textures
and
almost
trompeloeil
quality
of
his
final
graphite
works
what
becomes
clear
is
that
sol
was
interested
in
making
beautiful
things
said

joseph
c
thompson
during
a
recent
walk
through

theyre
exquisite
you
can
feel
human
touch
right
through
them
a
maze
of
creation
it
is
hard
to
stay
in
one
place
for
long
within
the
lewitt
installation
each
piece
leads
to
another
every
corner
revealing
the
next
sprawling
creation
you
are
drawn
in
as
if
visiting
a
multihued
version
of
an
english
hedge
maze
at
different
moments
youre
surrounded
by
geometric
shapes
swirls
and
blinding
colors
before
he
died
last
year
lewitt
designed
the
entire
exhibits
layout
with
new
internal
walls
that
stand
in
contrast
to
the
aged
brick
structure
that
surrounds
them
he
didnt
want
stanchions
keeping
viewers
away
from
the
works

which
while
making

a
bit
jittery
creates
an
intimacy
and
flow
for
the

ended
the

were
whitewashed
as
was
typical
for

there
was

i
never

always
been
matched
by
his
playfully
selfdeprecatory
view
of
his
own
work
began
to
get
serious
how
he
wondered
would
he
maintain
his
legacy
the
impermanent
nature
of
his
wall
drawings
something
hed
encouraged
appeared
in
conflict
with
the
notion
of
an
archive
reynolds
made
a
suggestion
what
about
mass
moca
thompson
a
friend
of
reynolds
loved
the
idea
he
hosted
lewitt
for
a
nearly
sixhour
visit
in
2003
not
long
afterward
the
artist
sent
along
a
proposal
we
have
space
and
time
and
access
to
interns
and
housing
and
we
make
art
here
said
thompson
it
was
a
good
fit
sols
response
was
that
a
good
idea
like
this
would
be
hard
to
screw
up
follow
directions
lewitt
began
creating
wall
drawings
in
the
late
60s
a
response
to
the
colorsplashed
pop
art
movement
the
works
were
creations
of
geometric
possibility
with
more
than
a
splash
of
humor
the
directions
for
installing
the
pieces
were
generally
in
the
subtitles
for
example
1970s
wall
drawing
56
includes
the
following
subtitle
a
square
is
divided
horizontally
and
vertically
into
four
equal
parts
each
with
lines
in
four
directions
superimposed
progressively
lewitts
idea
was
that
anybody
could
create
the
work
by
following
directions
in
this
sense
he
helped
pioneer
the
conceptual
notion
that
the
idea
of
an
artwork
is
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
piece
not
its
temporal
manifestation
works
would
then
be
executed
the
way
an
orchestra
might
perform
a
symphony
and
each
time
a
piece
would
not
necessarily
be
the
same
much
depended
on
the
technique
from
how
lightly
or
darkly
lines
might
be
drawn
to
an
installers
preferences
following
directions
by
giving
his
installers
freedom
lewitt
turned
what
could
have
been
a
paintbythenumbers
exercise
into
something
more
collaborative
the
key
to
keeping
you
interested
is
the
room
that
sol
leaves
between
the
instructions
and
the
complete
piece
said
tomas
ramberg
a
lewitt
installer
for
a
decade
who
served
as
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
mass
moca
project
you
get
to
sort
of
feel
like
youre
the
one
doing
it
ramberg
described
a
typical
working
process
with
lewitt
we
would
get
a
plan
from
sol
and
look
at
it
and
try
to
make
sense
of
it
he
said
sol
would
see
it
and
refine
his
description
of
what
he
was
after
for
the
lateperiod
pencil
sketches
other
than
the
shapes
lewitt
dictated
the
only
thing
he
knew
was
he
wanted
scribble
gradations
from
0
to
6
zero
being
white
and
six
being
completely
closed
up
if
lewitt
didnt
like
the
result
he
would
offer
more
instruction
ramberg
recalled
it
needs
to
look
more
like
corrugated
steel
he
might
say
creating
the
wall
drawings
can
be
mentally
taxing
in
the
past
ramberg
says
he
has
watched
as
installers
left
at
the
end
of
a
day
and
never
returned
that
didnt
happen
at
mass
moca
thats
partly
because
this
summer
there
was
the
camaraderie
of
the
team
over
the
summer
as
work
progressed
the
installers

all
of
them
artists
in
their
own
right

taped
pages
of
humorous
messages
attn
bugs
no
dying
on
the
wall
take
your
death
elsewhere
and
r
crumblike
cartoons
on
the
brick
walls
of

they
shared
rented
apartments
in
town
and
blasted
music
in
the
space
as
they
worked
nick
kozak
a
sculptor
from
the
hudson
valley
created
wall
drawing

a
threepanel
piece
that
required
rolling
up
dozens
of
1inchlong
slivers
of
colored
paper
to
be
inserted
into
pegboard
holes
his
secret
weapon
breaks
its
very
relaxing
in
a
way
because
you
have
an
idea
of
whats
going
on
and
whats
expected
he
said
but
you
always
need
to
take
a
step
back
or
as
fekishazy
said
on
the
most
frustrating
days
when
it
gets
hot
and
the
colored
leads
can
get
soft
and
break
you
at
least
know
that
itll
be
over
someday
many
of
the
workers
left
in
august
and
the
rest
were
gone
by
the
end
of

left

moca
to
get
ready
for

composer
steve
reich
a
longtime
lewitt
friend
will
be
on
hand
the
night
before
playing
at
a
small
private
party
for
project
supporters
and
lewitts
widow
carol
in
a
phone
interview
from
new
york
reich
talked
first
of
lewitts
generosity
toward
others
the
artist
was
famous
for
helping
artists
and
musicians
who
needed
support
reich
remembers
lewitt
coming
to
visit
him
in
1971
at
a
time
when
reich
needed
to
purchase
three
glockenspiels
which
he
couldnt
afford
sol
said
id
like
to
buy
one
of
your
scores
said
reich
i
didnt
drop
a
beat
and
said
what
would
you
like
sol
didnt
need
my
score
he
just
decided
he
admired
what
i
was
doing
and
knew
i
could
use
the
help
financially
reich
calls
the
mass
moca
project
a
fantastic
undertaking
sol
is
a
great
artist
of
the
20th
and
21st
century
and
wall
drawings
are
one
of
his
major
contributions
he
said
sol
deserves
it
thompson
the
museums
director
agrees
while
touring
the
space
he
showed
off
his
favorites
including
wall
drawing
880
a
70footlong
swirl
of
intertwined
bright
green
and
orange
the
edges
buzz
and
vibrate
he
said
as
you
look
at
it
your
eyes
begin
to
flicker
you
can
feel
sol
with
his
finger
right
in
your
rib
cage
thompson
said
raising
money
for
the
lewitt
project
not
only
for
the
renovation
but
for
an
archivist
who
will
work
out
of
yale
and
an
endowment
to
operate
building
7
was
easier
than
he
expected
he
considers
the
project
a
model
for
other
longterm
singleartist
installations
that
mass
moca
might
stage
to
augment
the
museums

tom
stoppard
thought
he
might
write
a
play
about
a
rock
star
living
like
a
hermit
in
suburbia
the
inspirational
recluse
was
syd
barrett
fallen
cofounder
of
pink
floyd
the
british
playwright
a
lover
of
music
and
chronicler
of
the
intersection
of
personal
and
political
identity
became
fixated
on
two
photos
of
barrett
one
a
beautiful
young
romantic
the
other
a
thickset
bald
man
pedaling
home
from
the
supermarket
the
knowledge
that
they
are
the
same
person
or
that
one
person
turns
into
the
other
person
is
something
which
i
find
affecting
stoppard
says
as
usual
with
me
the
play
turned
out
to
be
about
a
lot
of
different
thoughts
i
was
having
specifically
it
took
him
to
his
native
czechoslovakia
during
the
pivotal
years
between
1968
and
1990
rock
n
roll
stoppards
latest
theatrical
brain
tickler
is
a
heady
collision
of
politics
poetry
the
nature
of
consciousness
cancer
family
dynamics
human
spirit
and
yes
rock
n
roll
yet
the
play
isnt
without
a
throughline
near
the
end
a
czech
intellectual
named
lenka
sits
at
a
table
in
cambridge
england
with
an
aging
communist
a
sappho
scholar
and
a
music
fanatic
among
others
and
offers
this
tidy
summation
of
the
preceding
hours
and
decades
make
love
not
war
was
more
important
than
workers
of
the
world
unite
it
would
be
foolhardy
to
reduce
rock
n
roll
to
such
a
simplistic
cultural
legacy
but
lenkas
line
is
a
window
on
what
makes
this
play

and
stoppard
at
71

tick
set
in
cambridge
and
prague
rock
n
roll
ultimately
asks
what
lasts
music
does
and
watershed
recordings
by
the
rolling
stones
the
velvet
underground
pink
floyd
john
lennon
the
doors
and
bob
dylan
serenade
every
scene
change
but
rock
is
more
than
a
symbolic
soundtrack
to
the
revolutions
of
heart
mind
and
state
in
rock
n
roll
which
opens
friday
at
the
huntington
theatre
barrett
is
a
character
in
the
play
albeit
one
seen
only
fleetingly
the
young
beautiful
incarnation
opens
the
play
with
a
pan
flute
playing
golden
hair
to
a
teenage
flower
child
whose
daughter
22
years
on
will
become
the
bald
barretts
selfappointed
guardian
drugaddled
and
mentally
ill
barrett
was
booted
out
of
pink
floyd
in
1968
he
died
a
month
after
rock
n
roll
opened
in
2006
even
more
integral
to
the
plot
is
the
plastic
people
of
the
universe
a
czech
band
that
became
a
symbol
of
resistance
under
the
communist
government
during
the
1970s
at
the
end
of
act
i
when
the
young
czech
academic
jan
finds
his
treasured
record
collection
has
been
smashed
by
the
authorities
he
says
to
his
friend
its
only
rock
n
roll
for
stoppard
theres
a
deeper
sentiment
a
creed
for
living
really
that
courses
beneath
the
feelgood
surface
of
that
cliche
rock
n
roll
is
a
potent
phrase
for
me
says
the
playwright
its
much
more
than
a
description
of
a
certain
kind
of
music
it
also
has
implications
of
a
certain
kind
of
lifestyle
of
wishing
to
live
more
freely
from
the
conventions
of
society
and
when
things
go
wrong
it
implies
an
attitude
of
philosophical
stoicism
that
spirit
is
the
connective
thread
in
rock
n
roll
as
stoppard
chronicles
22
turbulent
years
bookended
by
the
prague
spring
and
the
velvet
revolution
in
the
life
of
max
a
brilliant
marxist
professor
his
musicobsessed
protege
jan
maxs
cancerstricken
wife
eleanor
a
greek
poetry
teacher
and
their
daughter
esme
like
jan
whom
the
author
concedes
is
something
of
an
alterego
stoppard
was
born
in
prague
in
1939
his
family
fled
to
singapore
then
india
when
the
nazis
invaded
czechoslovakia
his
father
who
remained
behind
was
killed
during
the
invasion
stoppard
moved
to
england
in
1946
when
his
mother
married
a
british
army
officer
if
id
gone
back
to
czechoslovakia
at
the
age
of
8
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
life
i
would
have
had
but
in
one
way
jans
could
be
considered
a
pseudoautobiographical
life
i
never
had
to
live
stoppard
says
for
that
reason
and
others
rock
n
roll
is
described
by
many
as
the
playwrights
most
personal
work
to
date

a
shift
away
from
more
abstract
politically
themed
works
such
as
every
good
boy
deserves
favour
about
a
dissident
imprisoned
in
a
mental
hospital
indian
ink
which
examines
british
rule
in
india
and
the
coast
of
utopia
a
trilogy
about
the
origins
of
modern
political
radicalism
in
19thcentury
russia
as
he
gets
older
i
think
hes
thought
a
great
deal
more
about
himself
what
it
means
to
come
from
that
background
how
he
feels
about
england
says
director
carey
perloff
widely
considered
to
be
stoppards
leading
american
interpreter
and
the
artistic
director
at
san
franciscos
american
conservatory
theater
with
which
the
huntington
collaborated
on
this
production
also
about
mortality
and
love
and
what
is
constant
about
the
human
heart
the
things
you
think
are
going
to
be
important
turn
out
not
to
be
so
important
things
that
look
permanent
disappear
like
the
soviet
union
and
things
that
seem
transient
like
a
moment
between
a
young
girl
and
a
man
last
and
things
that
would
by
all
logic
be
cast
in
stone

say
the
script
for
a
hit
play

are
not
stoppard
and
perloff
tinkered
with
dialogue
scene
structure
the
placement
of
music

over
the
phone
no
less
they
took
a
scalpel
to
the
ending
i
have
never
heard
of
this
says
huntington
artistic
director
peter
dubois
i
have
never
heard
of
a
writer
revisiting
a
work
after
their
west
end
and
broadway
premieres
its
a
testament
to
toms
work
ethic
and
his
belief
that
a
play
is
a
constantly
evolving
thing
interestingly
stoppard
describes
the
changes
as
insignificant
and
perloff
calls
the
acthuntington
production
radically
different
the
main
thing
was
the
dynamics
of
bringing
it
to
a
close
without
things
spilling
over
and
getting
lumpy
says
stoppard
we
had
a
long
discussion
about
whether
to
change
biscuit
to
cookie
and
the
production
has
a
new
design
thank
goodness
who
am
i
to
tell
tom
stoppard
to
change
his
play
perloff
asks
rhetorically
but
she
reports
that
their
relationship
is
built
on
such
a
fruitful
history
of
collaboration
and
trust
that
the
director
felt
free
to
make
numerous
and
wellreceived
suggestions
such
as
giving
one
characters
line
to
another
adding
dialogue
to
clarify
a
veiled
exchange
and
making
more
pointed
use
of
songs
music
is
the
currency
of
jan
and
esmes
love
its
their
code
perloff
says
it
couldnt
just
be
casual
sometimes
tom
is
very
subtle
and
buried
in
those
relationships
and
you
really
have
to
piece
it
together
stoppards
plays
are
famously
cerebral
and
while
rock
n
roll
is
perhaps
the
most
sentimental
of
his
works
its
packed
with
ideas
and
references
that
may
well
elude
the
casual
theatergoer
in
the
lobby
at
the
recent
philadelphia
production
playgoers
could
purchase
a
60page
glossary
covering
czech
history
greek
poetry
stalinist
vocabulary
and
cartesian
dualism
the
new
york
playbill
included
an
insert
explaining
playwright
and
former
czech
president
vaclav
havels
relationship
with
the
plastic
people
of
the
universe
a
primer
on
marx
and
brain
function
and
a
syd
barrett
bio
i
dont
think
i
could
actually
rationalize
how
all
the
bits
fit
together
and
im
not
really
very
interested
in
doing
that
stoppard
says
theater
is
the
event
while
its
happening
its
not
really
a
text
except
in
a
secondary
way
and
if
you
were
interested
in
writing
a
text
in
which
these
different
parts
of
the
map
were
connected
in
some
interesting
intelligent
way
then
the
text
would
be
an
essay
and
not
a
play
the
thing
which
really
holds
everything
together
is
the
personal
narrative
the
play
can
be
described
as
a
love
story
principally
a
love
story
in
the
context
of
all
these
other
things
that
notes
perloff
makes
rock
n
roll
something
distinctly
unstoppardian
an
everyman
tale
sometimes
people
are
scared
of
stoppards
work
because
they
think
you
need
a
phd
to
see
it
although
theres
a
lot
to
learn
i
think
that
its
emotionally
resonant
enough
that
if
you
dont
know
who
the
late
czech
politician
alexander
dubcek
is
you
can
watch
a
young
musicloving
intellectual
struggle
and
a
couple
grapple
with
death
and
a
teenager
grow
up
in
the
shadow
of
her
brilliant
parents
anyone
can
connect
to
that
perloff
says
those
are
very
human
experiences
not
unlike
the
experience

primal
galvanizing
and
cathartic

of
listening

jacques

a

who
said
whoever
wants
to
know
the
heart
and
mind
of
america
had
better
learn
baseball
the
rules
and
realities
of
the
game
he
wrote
that
in
1954
when
there
were
only
16
majorleague
teams
the
world
series
was
the
only
postseason
event
and
we
had
not
come
to
the
time
when
nearly
half
of

reflexively
hate

fear
a

it

barack
obama

talking

as
if
two
years
of
repeating
himself
is
something
to
be
proud
of
the

series
ended
last
week
in
the
worst

conditions
because
the

also
lasts

ok
ok
a
blizzard
would
have
been
worse
but
you
cant
physically
start
a
game
in
a
blizzard
you
can
and
they
did
start
a
game
last
week
in
sleet
that
left
it
possible
to
play
but
made
it
impossible
to
play
well
why
is
the
summer
game
played

the
frost
is

why
does
it

than
it

pitchers
for
16
teams
when
thats
all
there
were
expanded
into
any
city
willing
to
soak
the
taxpayers
to
build
a
stadium
and
become
bigleague
then
it
needed
playoffs
to
keep
interest
alive
longer
but
that
extended
the
season
and
made
major

baseball
more
like
a
youth

league
where
everyone
gets
a
trophy
two
more
words
television
contracts
with
the
premier

deep
in
football
season
baseball
has
to
play
at
times
convenient
to
the
network
not
to
the
realities
of
the
game
as
barzun
knew
them
but
the
money
is
good
and
the
show
must
go
on
so
the
reality
changes
politicians
are
also
part
of
a
show
trapped
in
a
doctors
office
one
could
hear
a
cable
network
go
from
john
mccain
live
to
joe
biden
live
neither
said
anything
he
hadnt
said
the
day
before
and
the
day
before
that
crowds
at
obamas
and
sarah
palins
rallies
are
sprinkled
with
people
whose
behavior
labels
them
as
fans
if
not
groupies
we
have
seen
that
before
though
when
the
campaigns
began
mccain
was
for
staying
and
surging
in
iraq
and
obama
stood
for
lets
go
home
that
was
to
be
the
issue
all
these
months
later
the
surge
has
worked
militarily
but
failed
politically
in
baghdad
and
the
bush
administration
is
talking
about
coming
home
obama
wanted
to
fight
in
pakistan
and
mccain
didnt
want
to
talk
about
it
in
public
now
the
bush
administration
fights
in
pakistan
and
talks
about
it
while
babies
were
being
born
learning
to
walk
and
starting
to
date
the
campaigns
droned
on
last
week
both
candidates
spoke
as
if
it
were
still
two
years
ago
and
the
economy
still
manageable
the
reality
of
the
economic
game
is
that
enormous
changes
are
happening
when
the
senators
plotted
economic
strategy
no
one
would
have
predicted
that
a
republican
administration
would
invest
in
banks
and
an
insurance
company
and
talk
about
absorbing
home
mortgages
and
investing
in
failing
auto
companies
it
would
not
have
been
credible
it
remains
so
incredible
to
a
timewarped
mccain
that
he
throws
the
socialism
spitball
at
his
opponent
even
though
the
countrys
main
commissar
is
a
former
goldman
sachs
chief
whom
president
bush
picked
to
run
the
treasury
department
reality
is
that
the
baseball
championship
was
decided
in
a
game
that
started
on
tuesday
and
ended
on
thursday
the
2008
campaign
has
been
so
similar
to
that
saga
that
you

has
developed
two
horizontal

our

worked
fine
until
recently
when
our

company
came
out
to
do
some
work
at
our

including
the
switching

what
can
we
do
to
fix
this
problem

doug
calvert
a
theres
a
strong
chance
theres
nothing
wrong
with
your

the
cable
installation
almost
certainly
is
to
blame
while
its
impossible
to
know
for
sure
without
checking
out
the
television
you
seem
to
be
experiencing
a
wellknown
problem
called
ground
loop
if
you
search
google
with
the
terms
rolling
lines
tv
youll
find
plenty
of
others
in
the
same
boat
the
problem
is
caused
by
an
improper
ground
for
the
cable
system
youll
find
some
homebrew
grounding
solutions
on
the
internet
but
i
strongly
recommend
you
not
try
to
fix
the
problem
yourself
unless
you
are
a
trained
electrician
instead
call
the
cable
folks
and
tell
them
you
believe
the
installation
is
not
correctly
grounded
if
youre
lucky
theyll
understand
the
ground
loop
problem
if
not
your
google
search
should
give
you
enough
background
to
explain
the
problem
to
a
technician
q
in

of

you
spoke

hell
work
13

per

we
spoke
to
him
by
phone
last
week
about
the
past
and
the
future
q
your
voice
on
fox
has
been
notable
compared
to
other
anchors
ive
always
thought
you
sounded
detached

not
in
the
fray
but
above
it
a
well
i
appreciate
that
thought
one
of
the
people
that
i
used
to
look
at
when
he
was
in
his
heyday
was
roger
mudd
and
roger
always
had
that
slightly
amused
detached
quality
about
him
and
i
always
admired
that
i
cant
say
i
copied
it
but
as
ive
gotten
older
it
becomes
more
of
the
way
i
look
at
things
theres
really
nothing
new
under
the
sun
obviously
its
a
new
thing
that
we
have
an
africanamerican
so
close
to
the
presidency
but
you
get
down
to
the
things
hes
doing
and
talking
about
the
ideology

its
something
im
very
familiar
with
q
yet
in
this
election
the
pitch
of
the
rhetoric
seems
angrier
and
more
extreme
than
ever
do
you
attribute
that
to
blogs
talk
radio
24hour
cable
a
to
some
extent
its
become
more
visible
because
of
the
accelerated
news
cycle
and
omnipresence
of
coverage
plus
you
have
things
that
have
happened
here
in
washington
that
have
contributed
when
i
was
a
reporter
democratic
congress
seemed
redundant
theyd
had
it
over
decades
i
was
there
when
the
republicans
controlled
the
senate
for
a
few
years
but
the
house

it
never
seemed
close
to
change
and
then
it
did
and
i
think
it
was
very
difficult
for
democrats
to
stomach
that
newt
gingrich
was
a
very
polarizing
figure
after
that
was
the
impeachment
of
bill
clinton
and
then
there
was
the
florida
recount
then
you
have
the
war
in
iraq
you
add
all
those
things
together
and
you
get
this
brew
of
ingredients
that
gives
us
this
current
atmosphere
that
is
pretty
polarized
and
pretty
ugly
it
makes
news
but
its
disheartening
q
doesnt
the
partisanship
of
the
media
outlets
themselves
contribute
you
can
now
get
your
news
filtered
through
a
left
or
rightwing
lens
a
you
can
do
that
if
you
want
to
but
im
bound
to
say
that
the
difference
we
have
now
is

i
worked
in
the
mainstream
media
for
years
as
a
correspondent
at
abc
news
i
was
there
for
23
years
before
that
i
worked
for
newspapers
there
was
never
any
doubt
in
my
mind
after
i
woke
up
to
it
that
the
media
tilted
left
theres
a
homogeneity
of
viewpoint
about
a
whole
range
of
issues
theres
an
unspoken
consensus
about
abortion
and
the
environment
and
tax
policy
and
the
use
of
military
force
now
there
are
some
countervailing
forces
theres
a
blend
in
the
media
and
more
of
a
balance
q
when
you
anchor
on
fox
do
you
see
yourself
as
providing
a
sort
of
antidote
to
leftwing
bias
a
not
quite
what
i
would
say
about
fox
news
is
that
we
saw
the
competitive
opportunity
that
was
afforded
us

strictly
talking
about
news
coverage
now
there
were
two
places
we
could
look
to
run
to
daylight
one
was
stories
that
were
legitimate
but
they
just
were
not
being
emphasized
or
done
at
all
acorn
thats
a
very
good
story
we
had
a
free
run
with
that
for
a
couple
of
weeks
before
anyone
got
into
it
and
then
there
are
stories
that
we
develop
in
a
different
way
than
others
do
it
it
is
now
a
consensus
in
the
media
that
the
swift
boat
veterans
for
truth
were
a
bunch
of
liars
what
we
found
is
that
they
were
mistaken
some
of
the
time
and
they
were
right
some
of
the
time
i
think
those
are
journalistically
valid
approaches
sherrod
brown
the
democratic
senator
from
ohio
was
supposedly
on
the
senate
floor
talking
about
how
hard
it
is
going
be
for
bill
oreilly
on
election
night
when
he
has
to
report
that
barack
obama
won
but
its
not
going
be
bill
oreilly
its
going
to
be
me
q
still
are
you
conscious
when
you
anchor
of
trying
to
perpetuate
a
balance
a
im
a
conservative
but
i
was
a
reporter
long
before
i
was
a
conservative
and
im
still
a
reporter
first
and
unless
people
have
ideas
that
only
liberals
should
be
reporters
i
would
think
they
wouldnt
have
any
problem
with
me
when
im
sitting
in
the
anchor
chair
i
dont
state
my
opinion
and
i
try
very
hard
to
be
evenhanded
q
can
we
recover
from
this
partisanship
once
the
election
is
over
a
i
dont
have
any
doubt
there
will
be
a
honeymoon
as
there
has
been
in
the
past
now
if
the
president
comes
stumbling
out
of
the
blocks
the
way
poor
bill
clinton
did
the
honeymoon
wont
last
very
long
but
barack
obama
hes
a
tremendously
likable
and
appealing
guy
and
if
hes
elected
most
americans
will
say
give
him
a
chance
thats
the
way
americans
are
and
i
think
its
a
nice
thing
and
a
good
thing
if
he
turns
out
to
be
as
moderate
in
policy
as
he
is
in
temperament
the
honeymoon
could
last
a
long
time

i
am
more
thrifty
these
days
i
buy
bulk
coffee
beans
instead
of
the
starbucks
ground
coffee
i
once
used
ive
cut
back
on
restaurant
meals
and
i
wash
and
iron
some
clothes
that
once
were
sent
to
the
dry
cleaners
but
on
rare
occasions
i
allow
myself
a
luxury
or
two
while
few
of
us
can
afford
a
rollsroyce
or
private
jet
almost
anyone

even
a
semiretired
newspaperman

can
enjoy
owning
a
topoftheline
gadget
theres
a
joy
in
luxury
maybe
im
fooling
myself
but
i
think
it
can
be
practical
too
these
rare
flings
with
luxury
make
it
easier
for
me
to
cut
corners
cheerfully
and
live
an
economical
life
theres
an
even
better
benefit
highend
products
often
last
longer
perform
better
and
come
from
companies
eager
to
stand
behind
their
products
you
wont
always
save
money
over
the
long
run
but
in
some
cases
the
cost
of
luxury
may
be
less
than
it
seems
today
well
look
at
items
that
fit
my
definition
of
sensible
hightech
luxury
while
these
arent
the
most
expensive
gadgets
available
in
their
class
they
represent
the
kind
of
quality
money
can
buy
i
can
easily
recommend
any
item
described
here
but
thats
not
the
point
spend
your
luxury
money
on
gadgets
you
crave
not
the
ones
that
fit
my
life
but
here
are
some
examples
to
get
you
thinking
loud
and
clear
ill
start
with
my
koss
cobalt
wireless
headphones
it
would
be
easy
to
find
wireless
headphones
for
less
than
the
200
price
tag
but
the
famed
koss
sound
quality
is
especially
impressive
when
you
consider
this
set
uses
bluetooth
technology
to
deliver
audio
with
no
wires
no
tinkering
is
required
to
get
them
going
the
supplied
audio
transmitter
plugs
into
the
earphone
jack
of
your

system
mp3
player
or
television
those
with
bluetoothequipped
cellphones
can
also
use
them
but
heres
what
money
really
can
buy
after
using
my
headset
for
more
than
two
years
it
went
on
the
fritz
i
had
never
bothered
to
send
in
the
warranty
information
i
called
koss
with
low
expectations
especially
given
the
state
of
customer
service
in
general
what
a
surprise
no
warranty
information
no
problem
a
2yearold
gadget
thats
ok
theres
a
lifetime
warranty
the
usbased
customer
service
representative
volunteered
to
send
a

unit
immediately
along
with
a

mailer
to
send
the
old
one
back
pay
more
get
more
in
these
days
of
50
inkjet
printers
i
own
one
that
costs
10
times
that
amount
i
did
a
quick
web
search
on
prices
for
my
canon
i9900
wideformat
inkjet
and
found
they
start
in
the
mid400s
and
extended
to
600
heres
what
i
got
for
the
money
my
printer
is
now
about
4
years
old
and
is
still
working
fine
one
of
my
hobbies
is
studio
photography
and
ive
made
16by20
photographic
prints
that
stack
up
against
what
youd
get
from
a
custom
processor
itll
do
the
routine
chores
like
cranking
out
letters
and
printing
envelopes
but
unless
highquality
giant
photographic
prints
are
important
to
you
it
may
well
be
a
luxury
that
most
could
do
without
but
for
me
its
a
true
joy
iphone
calling
it
would
be
impossible
to
talk
about
luxury
gadgets
without
mentioning
the
iphone
it
is
one
of
those
rare
products
that
redefines
technology
i
dont
own
an
iphone
but
im
anything
but
typical
i
seldom
even
know
where
my
cellphone
is
i
prefer
to
remain
out
of
touch
still
ive
been
tempted
to
buy
one
just
to
own
such
a
marvelous
gadget
when
ive
used
the
iphone
i
marvel
at
the
userfriendly
screen
and
the
builtin
features
such
as
the
way
it
uses
gps
and
cell
towers
to
pinpoint
your
location
just
as
the
first
ibm
pc
did
this
product
will
force
other
manufacturers
to
change
how
they
think
of
cellphones
like
i
said
this
isnt
a
shopping
list
but
rather
a
rationale
for
occasionally
splurging
on
topend
technology
for
those
of
us
cutting
back
on
spending
a
few
small
splurges

hospital
in
belmont
mass
where
the
staff
wanted
to
hold
him
against
his
will
another
stay
in
a
mental
hospital
he
felt
would
unravel
the
life
he
had
begun
to
put
back
together
he
zigzagged
between
brush
and
trees
to
leave
no
clear
tracks
this
was
the
climax
in
a
series
of
psychiatric
implosions
that
had
landed
delman
in
hospitals
driven
away
girlfriends
stymied
his
attempts
to
find
work
as
a
lawyer
and
left
him
feeling
lost
and
often
suicidal
what
kept
him
alive
he
believes
was
what
powered
that
escape
grit
and
determination
against
all
odds
that
wild
woodland
run
happened
just
about
a
decade
ago
last
week
delman
received
one
of
the
nations
most
prestigious
awards
for
community
health
work
a
125000
leadership
prize
from
the
robert
wood
johnson
foundation
the
award
honors
people
who
conquer
huge
obstacles
and
take
commanding
action
in
local
communities
on
healthcare
issues
delman
who
is
49
and
lives
in
stoneham
founded
and
runs
consumer
quality
initiatives
a
groundbreaking
boston
agency
staffed
mainly
by
people
with
mental
illness
they
survey
other
people
who
receive
mental
health
services
from
the
state
and
analyze
the
data
for
ways
to
make
improvements
the
group
for
example
identified
problems
encountered
by
young
people
who
age
out
of
the
states
mental
health
system
for
children
work
that
contributed
to
significant
changes
including
a
3
million
program
to
help
with
the
transition
to
the
adult
system
given
the
stigma
that
mental
illness
still
carries
and
the
traditional
dominance
of
academics
in
research
delman
has
had
to
fight
long
and
hard
for
his
group
to
gain
legitimacy
said
marylou
sudders
the
former
state
commissioner
of
mental
health
who
has
known
delman
since
the
mid90s
if
he
ever
has
any
doubt
about
himself
which
he
shouldnt
have
getting
a
robert
wood
johnson
award
is
like
the
good
housekeeping
seal
of
approval
she
said
delmans
bipolar
disorder
has
not
disappeared
he
still
takes
six
psychiatric
medications
a
day
three
for
sleep
but
he
has
been
able
to
build
his
recovery
on
two
of
the
central
pillars
of
many
lives
work
and
love
its
hard
to
recover
from
where
i
was

on
social
security
disability
with
serious
mental
illness
hospitalized
numerous
times
down
in
the
dumps
and
facing
so
many
barriers
he
said
i
was
able
to
overcome
those
barriers
because
of
advantages
in
my
life

family
and
education

and
my
own
intense
desire
to
overcome
them
and
finally
my
loving
relationship
with
my
wife
and
a
job
all
around
him
delman
said
in
an
interview
he
sees
people
in
positions
similar
to
his
a
decade
ago
caught
in
the
catch
22
that
because
they
have
a
mental
illness
they
cannot
get
the
work
and
support
that
would
help
them
overcome
it
i
see
a
lot
of
unrealized
potential
and
it
makes
me
very
sad
he
said
despite
delmans
bipolar
disorder
he
graduated
from
tufts
university
summa
cum
laude
and
from
law
school
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
but
after
his
crises
and
hospitalizations
began
in
his
thirties
he
found
it
impossible
to
get
work
as
a
lawyer
even
when
he
was
functioning
well
he
came
out
as
a
person
with
mental
illness
in
the
mid1990s
as
he
sought
to
fight
discrimination
and
educate
others
about
their
employment
rights
around
that
time
he
met
his
future
wife
deborah
who
is
also
a
leading
massachusetts
advocate
for
people
with
mental
illness
she
had
mixed
feelings
about
him
deborah
delman
said
he
had
not
been
working
and
as
a
single
mother
she
could
not
support
both
him
and
her
son
pete
as
jonathan
delman
tells
it
his
temper
also
put
her
off
but
he
was
great
with
pete
and
they
worked
shoulder
to
shoulder
toward
their
common
causes
for
many
months
one
day
at
a
table
at
a
bickfords
restaurant
in
waltham
he
was
confessing
his
love
for
her

not
for
the
first
time

and
she
reached
across
the
table
tears
welling
up
in
her
eyes
and
took
his
hand
to
her
own
shock
she
said
i
love
you
it
was
the
greatest
moment
in
my
life
jonathan
delman
said
since
his
mclean
escape
soon
before
they
married
i
have
not
been
back
to
a
hospital
delman
said
and
i
will
never
go
back
to
a
hospital
but
what
he
learned
as
a
psychiatric
patient
now
informs
delmans
work
in
helping
others
for
example
he
said
he
experienced
firsthand
how
arbitrary
rules
or
petty
cruelties
by
hospital
staff
can
demoralize
and
alienate
patients
patients
can
feel
that
if
they
complain
they
risk
retribution
and
nothing
will
change
anyway
so
when
his
agency
began
to
survey
psychiatric
patients
in
hospitals
it
asked
about
staffandpatient
interactions
it
also
asked
about
other
issues
that
can
deeply
affect
patients
were
they
treated
with
respect
and
dignity
did
they
have
needed
privacy
did
they
have
access
to
a
telephone
or
consider
psychiatric
medications
the
antidepressant
zoloft
helped
delman
but
when
he
was
hospitalized
in
the
mid1990s
he
was
abruptly
taken
off
it
without
being
consulted
and
put
on
another
medication
that
made
him
physically
ill
he
felt
like
a
zombie
for
months
until
he
finally
asked
to
be
put
back
on
his
previous
medications
and
greatly
improved
these
days
consumer
quality
initiatives
is
working
on
a
project
to
give
consumers
decisionmaking
tools
to
help
them
have
more
input
into
their
prescriptions
including
guidance
on
which
websites
have
the
best
medical
information
some
of
his
prize
money
will
go
toward
that
project
delman
said
a
lot
of
the
work
jon
has
done
has
changed
thousands
of
peoples
lives
in
massachusetts
but
they
dont
know
jon
was
part
of
it
said
alisa
k
lincoln
an
associate
professor
of
health
sciences
and
sociology
at
northeastern
university
who
has
worked
with
delman
for
years
and
nominated
him
for
the
prize
delman
began
by
focusing
on
giving
consumers
more
voice
in
the
treatments
they
received
but
he
is
focusing
increasingly
on
dragging
academic
research
out
of
the
ivory
tower
and
orienting
it
more
toward
changing
the
real
world
delman
is
also
working
at
boston
universitys
school
of
public
health
toward
a
health
services
research
doctorate
which
he
is
on
track
to
receive
in
2010
that
leaves
little
free
time
but
he
has
no
complaints

quite
the
opposite
i
love
responsibility
he
said
it
was
when
i
didnt
have
it
that
i
felt
depressed

the

from

had
one
of
the
giddier
rides
in
primetime
history
it
went
from
near
cancellation
to
cultural
phenomenon
and
a
brief
spot
at
no
1
in
the
nielsen
ratings
in
the
process
it
created
a
spy
mania
on
network
television
so
great
was
the
shows
popularity
it
even
inspired
a
shortlived
companion
series
the
girl
from
uncle
soon
enough
came
selfparody
and
eventual
cancellation
in
its
third
season
uncle
didnt
just
jump
the
shark
it

vaulted
it
even
so
for

of

the

the

well
let
them
mourn
in

there
is
much
explaining
to
do
for
the
uninitiated
in
the
hierarchy
of
60s
spy
tv
uncle
stood
alone
mission
impossible
was
too
gimmicky
i
spy
too
jokey
the
wild
wild

too
anachronistic
among

scriptwriters
were
robert

and

richard
donner

four
episodes
in
1964
making

and
kuryakin
the
lethal

of
their
day
its
no
wonder
quentin
tarantino
long
spoke
of
making
a
movie
version
robert
vaughn
played
solo
asked
his
opinion
after
reading
the
script
for
the
pilot
he
blurted
out
its
james
bond
for
television
in
fact
bonds
creator
ian
fleming
had
briefly
assisted
in
creating
the
series
his
sole
contribution
was
the
name
of
solos
character
a
dashing
debonair
secret
agent
who
looks
good
in
a
tux
and
is
caviar
to
the
ladies
sound
familiar
the
unaired
pilot
included
in
the
dvd
set
was
called
solo
bond
really
was
a
solo
operator
albeit
with
the
inevitable
supporting
cast
of
m
and
q
and
moneypenny
and
the
occasional
appearance
by
cia
agent
felix
leiter
cant
forget
the
us
market
and
solo
was
supposed
to
live
up
to
his
isolating
name
yet
the
beauty
of
the
eventual
title
was
the
balance
it
struck
between
individual
and
organization
uncle
stood
for
united
network
command
for
law
and
enforcement
the
organizations
name
simultaneously
evoked
uncle
sam
and
the
united
nations
during
the
shows
run
tourists
frequently
asked
un
guides
for
the
whereabouts
of
uncle
headquarters
despite
the
weekly
thanks
offered
to
the
organization
in
the
shows
closing
credits
it
didnt
exist
nor
did
thrush
uncles
thoroughly
nefarious
rival
operation
emphasizing
the
organization
did
two
things

and
they
are
easily
the
two
best
things
about
the
series
first
it
played
up
leo
g
carroll
in
the
role
of
professorial
spymaster
alexander
waverly
the
head
of
uncle
in
a
nice
bit
of
foreshadowing
carroll
had
played
a
similar
part
in
alfred
hitchcocks
north
by
northwest
1959
his
droll
avuncularity
was
an
enormous
asset
even
better
was
david
mccallums
kuryakin
lizardy
and
vaguely
epicene
vaughns
solo
had
a
slightly
nasal
voice
and
everpresent
smirk
the
overall
effect
was
one
of
effete
chilliness
imagine
a
suave
hugh
hefner
trading
in
his
pipe
and
pepsi
for
a
walther
p38
small
wonder
that
in
vaughns
bestknown
film
role
in
bullitt
1968
he
would
be
cast
as
a
villain
ah
but
where
vaughns
solo
was
chilly
mccallums
kuryakin
was
cool

very
cool
indeed
if
julie
christie
had
the
60s
sexiest
lower
lip
as
she
most
certainly
did
then
mccallum
was
a
distant
second
add
in
his
blond
bangs
high
cerebral
forehead
and
penchant
for
dark
turtlenecks
and
a
teen
idol
was
born
an
air
of
distracted
bemusement
helped
too
when
kuryakin
pretended
to
be
the
son
of
lawrence
of
arabia
in
a
season
two
episode
it
didnt
seem
at
all
implausible
mccallum
could
have
been
peter
otooles
more
subdued
scottish
cousin
or
oskar
werners
mccallum
received
more
fan
mail
than
any
actor
in
the
history
of
mgm
the
studio
that
produced
uncle
the
show
became
the
first
beachhead
of
the
60s
youthquake
in
prime
time
it
was
a
fluke
mccallum
had
all
of
two
lines
in
the
pilot
the
producers
quickly
realized
what
genuine
chemistry
existed
between
him
and
vaughn
a
chemistry
no
less
effective
for
being
endothermic
and
quickly
built
up
the
role
ilya
and
napoleon
mixed
together
like
tonic
water
and
gin
uncle
had
its
share
of
gimmicks
agents
entered
the
organizations
headquarters
through
the
fitting
room
of
a
tailor
shop
viewers
like
thrush
never
thought
to
wonder
what
a
skyscraper
was
doing
behind
a
storefront
there
were
gadgets
of
course
most
notably
agents
ballpointpen
communicators
each
episode
was
divided
into
four
acts
which
seemed
sort
of
classy
and
transitions
denoted
by
blurry
rapid
pans
which
seemed
very
up
to
the
minute
so
did
the
fact
of
kuryakins
being
russian
he
was
a
oneman
precursor
of
dtente
heavy
on
flutes
and
bongos
jerry
goldsmiths
theme
doesnt
quite
rank
with
john
barrys
for
the
bond
movies
or
lalo
schifrins
for
mission
impossible
schifrin
would
be
called
in
to
reorchestrate
the
uncle
theme
for
the

optical

which

is
to

this
basic

of
our

it
does
so
with

and

first

is
the
rare

to
remind
us
how
arbitrary
that

drawn
from

of

that
dislocation
can
take
many
forms
cropping
foreshortening
mirroring
extreme
closeups
unusual

superimposed

unfamiliar

incongruous
juxtaposition
it
does
not
take
the
form
of
darkroom
manipulation
the
114
images
in
the

are
all
examples
of
straight
photography

which
makes
for
that
much
more
upending
of

can
mean
revelation

something
we

the
list
goes
on
such
unfamiliarity
makes
perfect
sense
fame
is
a
concomitant
of
familiarity
and
optical
disorder
is
something
the
eye
tends
to
avoid
its
true
that
part
of
what

lee

how
unconventionally

the
reflection

rather
than

yet
the
play
of

planes
and
tension
between
continuity
and
disruption
in

are
so
ambiguous
that
that
surely
helps
account

its
not

because

covers

we
keep
trying

account
for

token

looked
up

theres
a

by

revert

again

interviewing
charlie
kaufman

on

seems

scrunch
his

tightly
shut

as
though
trying

read
his

on

and
this
is
one
of
his
good
days
kaufman
is
in
town
to
promote
synecdoche
new
york

actually
that
sentence
is
unusual
in
a
number
of
ways
the
film
which
opens
in
boston
on
friday
is
the
acclaimed
screenwriters
first
foray
behind
the
camera
after
having
penned
headspinning
metadramas
like
being
john
malkovich
adaptation
and
eternal
sunshine
of
the
spotless
mind
the
last
earning
him
a
best
original
screenplay
oscar

the

actively

its
almost

to
describe
other
than
as
a

mc

in
schenectady
ny
synecdoche
stars
philip
seymour

as
another
of
kaufmans
cosmically
miserable
artist
heroes
this
one
a
theater
director
who
restages
his
own
life
in
a
downtown

the

is
jammed
with
great
actresses
doing

davis
catherine
keener
emily
watson

and
features
one
character
named
ellen
bascomb
who
may
not
exist
at
all
synecdoche
might
be
kaufmans
definitive
word
on
creativity
the
mystery
of
women
and
the
larger
mystery
of
life
itself
not
exactly
a
talking
chihuahua
movie
third
kaufman
hates
to
be
interviewed
and
has
mostly
resisted
the
promotional
dogandpony
show
on
his
other
films
this
time
though
theres
no
spike
jonze
or
michel
gondry
to
take
the
heat
and
kaufman
does
want
to
get
the
word
out
about
the
movie
well
some
of
the
words
and
maybe
he
doesnt
want
you
to
see
the
movie
its
up
to
you
really
welcome
to
charlie
kaufmans
bizarro
hollywood
where
movies
stand
or
fall
on
their
merits
and
the
filmmakers
a
selfeffacing
mensch
q
whats
the
one
question
everyones
asking
so
i
dont
have
to
ask
it
again
a
what
does
the
burning
house
mean
every
qampampa
i
get
that
one
i
say
i
dont
explain
what
happens
in
my
movies
because
i
want
the
audience
to
have
their
experience
of
it
and
if
i
say
this
is
what
it
means
then
you
cant
have
that
im
giving
them
permission
to
have
their
own
experience
q
most
moviegoers
resist
that
though
theyre
afraid
of
making
a
mistake
a
but
you
cant
make
a
mistake
and
thats
what
i
try
to
tell
people
this
is
your
movie
now
im
done
with
it
take
it
leave
it
interact
with
it
its
yours
to
do
what
you
want
with
and
you
cant
possibly
be
wrong
q
in
a
way
subjectivity
is
the
subject
of
the
film
a
its
the
subject
of
the
film
but
the
films
also
a
metaphor
for
how
people
live
their
lives

how
people
project
onto
the
world
a
story
about
this
very
messy
confusing
nonstory
world
because
of
how
the
human
mind
works
we
organize
life
into
these
stories
and
cast
people
as
characters
and
understand
their
motives
and
tell
ourselves
why
theyre
doing
this
or
why
theyre
doing
that
it
becomes
this
kind
of
fiction
being
a
person
q
can
you
talk
about
the
difference
between
writing
which
is
a
solitary
endeavor
and
going
on
a
set
and
directing
which
is
the
opposite
of
solitary
a
i
think
youve
just
said
it

how

a
i
like
writing
but
its
very
lonely
sometimes
and
it
requires
a
lot
of
discipline
its
the
opposite
of
pragmatic
and
directing
is
enormously
pragmatic
its
also
very
structured
i
mean
as
a
director
every
moment
i
know
exactly
where
im
supposed
to
be
and
if
i
forget
theres
someone
there
to
tell
me
and
its
managerial
so
i
have
to
figure
out
how
to
talk
to
people
on
an
individual
basis
its
not
like
theres
one
way
to
talk
to
actors
theyre
all
different
i
also
have
to
let
go
of
my
natural
personality
traits
which
are
sulking
and
moodiness
and
kind
of
become
an
adult
because
thats
required
q
you
have
to
be
the
designated
adult
in
the
room
a
i
do
and
im
not
allowed
not
to
be
in
some
ways
its
like
being
a
parent
i
dont
mean
that
in
a
condescending
way
but
simply
that
if
you
have
a
child
you
have
to
hold
it
together
so
that
was
my
responsibility
and
i
did
it
it
was
easier
in
the
mornings
the
days
which
ran
very
very
long
for
the
first
10
hours
i
could
do
it
very
well
and
then
once
i
started
to
get
tired
i
wanted
to
go
somewhere
and
have
a
fit
and
i
couldnt
that
was
sort
of
a
regular
occurrence
q
how
far
back
have
you
been
interested
in
writing
these
nonlinear
boxes
within
boxes
when
did
you
start
writing
for
lack
of
a
better
word
recognizably
charlie
kaufmanesque
works
a
i
remember
reading
six
characters
in
search
of
an
author
in
high
school
and
being
amazed
that
this
had
been
written
at
the
same
time
there
was
stuff
like
monty
python
and
national
lampoon
in
the
70s
ionesco
stuff
that
questioned
what
we
accept
as
reality
sometimes
in
a
very
comic
way
at
the
time
i
was
mostly
thinking
about
comedic
things
q
you
were
at
boston
university
for
a
while
a
i
was
in
the
acting
program
at
bu
i
had
grown
up
wanting
to
be
an
actor
and
i
decided
suddenly
during
my
freshman
year
that
it
embarrassed
me
i
left
and
went
to
nyu
film
school
to
study
production
it
was
basically
a
giant
workshop
i
wrote
this
script
which
took
place
over
one
night
about
an
insomniac
trying
to
go
to
sleep
its
actually
not
that
different
from
some
of
the
things
i
would
write
now
it
was
fairly
experimental
in
terms
of
structure
and
the
professor
really
loved
it
i
remember
my
classmate
was
chris
columbus
and
the
professor
held
up
our
two
scripts
as
shining
examples
of
really
great
writing
but
at
the
same
time
recognizing
they
were
polar
opposites
and
of
course
chris
went
off
to
become
enormously
successful
immediately
and
i
couldnt
get
a
job
for
11
years
after
graduating
i
answered
phones
that
whole
time
q
im
assuming
you
wrote
malkovich
on
spec
how
much
resistance
was
there
to
it
a
no
one
wanted
to
make
it
i
didnt
write
it
to
be
made
i
wrote
it
thinking
maybe
it
would
get
me
assignment
work
but
i
was
told
that
it
would
never
be
made
q
by
whom
a
by
everybody
people
would
tell
me
they
loved
it
they
thought
it
was
hysterical
they
had
it
on
their
bedside
table
and
read
it
a
lot
but
itll
never
be
made
and
for
a
couple
of
years
that
seemed
to
be
the
case
and
then
spike
jonze
read
it
and
wanted
to
make
it
and
he
was
in
a
position
to
be
able
to
q
why
did
you
set
the
new
film
in
schenectady
because
of
the
wordplay
with
synecdoche
a
no
i
dont
think
so
pause
i
dont
know
why
q
as
youre
writing
all
these
different
female
characters
are
you
consciously
creating
aspects
of
women
or
are
they
popping
up
more
organically
a
theyre
based
on
people
that
i
know
or
parts
of
people
that
i
know
or
ideas
about
relationships
that
i
wanted
to
explore
and
then
as
it
evolves
they
start
to
make
sense
to
me
and
i
like
them
so
i
continue
in
that
direction
its
more
of
an
intuitive
process
than
a
calculated
process
q
do
some
of
the
characters
take
on
lives
of
their
own
a
well
i
think
that
they
always
do
you
dont
know
how
to
write
dialogue
for
claire
at
first
and
then
you
start
to
realize
what
she
sounds
like
and
it
becomes
easier
to
write
her
that
happens
with
everybody
it
becomes
so
that
you
can
actually
have
a
conversation
almost
in
real
time
between
characters
q
who
is
ellen
bascomb
a
what
do
you
mean
q
who
is
ellen
bascomb
a

what
do
you
mean
q
isnt
she
the
cleaning
lady
a
yeah
q
we
never
see
her
do
we
a
uhuh
q
ok
so
who
is
she
a
what
do
you
mean
laughter
i
dont
know
who
she
is
shes
someone
who
may
or
may
not
exist
obviously
she
never
comes
to
do
her
job
so
i
guess
that
brings
her
existence
into
question
but
i
dont
know
if
she
exists
q
sorry
thats
my
one
what
does
it
all
mean
question
a
i
read
this
anecdote
about
a
classical
composer
who
played
a
piano
piece
and
somebody
asked
him
what
does
it
mean
and
he
sat
down
and
played
it
again
thats
what
people
do

they
want
to
impose
a
meaning
or
a
structure
onto
what
is
what
it
is
q
well
its
also
that
synechdoche
new
york
comes
to
us
in
the
form
of
a
commercial
movie
with
movie
stars
its
not
like
its
hanging
in
a
museum
where
a
museumgoer
would
bring
different
expectations
to
bear
on
it
a
but
thats
exactly
the
example
that
i
use
it
is
to
me
like
the
interaction
that
i
have
with
a
painting
at
a
museum
most
of
the
time
theres
no
verbal
thing
going
on
but
it
can
be
incredibly
moving
i
do
consider
this
an
art
form
and
my
goal
is
to
treat
it
that
way
i
dont
know
if
theres
a
market
for
that
i
guess
well
find
out
ill
talk
about
the
movie
but
im
not
going
to
tell
people
to
go
see
it
and
im
not
going
to
tell
them
what
its
about
i
dont
want
to
trick
people
into
going
to
see
it
q
thats
my
job

dumanel
luxama
began
his
life
in
rural
haiti
doubly
unlucky
he
was
born
with
a
rare
deformity
a
hole
in
his
skull
that
let
his
growing
brain
bulge
outward
into
a
lump
between
his
eyes
as
big
as
half
a
tennis
ball
and
an
even
larger
cyst
swelling
unseen
inside
his
brain
threatened
to
suppress
his
vital
functions
and
kill
him
but
when
he
was
just
a
few
months
old
dumanels
luck
began
to
change
many
in
his
family
held
old
folk
beliefs
about
health
they
thought
dumanels
lump
might
have
been
caused
by
his
mothers
cravings
during
pregnancy
or
an
evil
spirit
but
his
father
almane
believed
in
christianity
and
western
medicine
he
sold
his
only
two
cows
to
seek
the
best
possible
help
for
his
son
a
14hour
busride
from
their
dirtfloored
house
last
march
brought
the
two
to
a
hospital
in
the
town
of
hinche
it
lacked
all
but
the
simplest
medical
instruments
but
operation
smile
and
partners
in
health
both
nonprofits
famed
for
providing
free
health
care
to
poor
people
around
the
world
were
sponsoring
a
special
clinic
for
cleftlip
patients
that
week
dr
john
meara
chief
of
plastic
surgery
at
childrens
hospital
boston
happened
to
be
volunteering
when
dumanel
arrived
and
easily
identified
the
lump
that
would
have
mystified
most
doctors
it
was
called
an
encephalocele
ensefaloseel
he
had
treated
them
in
australia
even
written
papers
on
them
they
were
not
just
unsightly
they
were
dangerous
dumanel
needed
major
brain
surgery
we
cant
do
this
here
he
said
partners
in
health
handled
the
red
tape
childrens
donated
money
time
and
venue
on
aug
21
dumanel
lay
at
childrens
on
one
of
the
highesttech
pediatric
operating
tables
in
the
world
as
meara
and
colleagues
working
for
free
reengineered
his
brain
and
skull
in
a
concert
of
neuro
and
plastic
surgery
only
in
the
last
few
years
has
such
a
complex
operation
become
feasible
he
said
what
once
would
have
taken
24
hours
was
over
in
eight
and
dumanel
was
out
of
the
intensive
care
unit
a
day
or
so
later
now
he
bears
a
scalloped
line
of
faint
scars
around
his
head
and
a
light
line
across
his
nose
but
he
is
crawling
and
pulling
himself
up
on
chairs
to
stand
like
any
neartoddler
and
has
moved
on
from
ooohh
his
only
sound
before
the
operation
to
da
da
and
ma
ma
on
tuesday
dumanel
and
his
father
will
leave
to
return
home
to
their
small
farming
community
on
haitis
central
plateau
now
he
can
start
on
his
road
in
life
luxama
said
gratefully
during
a
recent
followup
visit
to
childrens
dumanel
is
one
of
only
about
a
dozen
haitian
children
who
have
been
brought
to
the
united
states
for
surgery
this
year
said
dr
david
walton
a
partners
in
health
physician
who
helped
get
dumanel
to
boston
there
are
literally
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
these
kids
out
there
many
with
congenital
heart
defects
whose
problems
are
never
detected
until
it
is
too
late
he
said
others
are
diagnosed
but
still
die
of
diseases
that
could
be
treated
with
surgery
haiti
has
the
highest
infant
mortality
rate
in
the
western
hemisphere
62
out
of
every
1000
live
births
meara
emphasized
that
while
dumanel
of
course
benefited
from
his
medical
care
so
did
the
doctors
who
provided
it
his
case
offered
trainees
a
valuable
opportunity
to
learn
about
the
care
of
a
rare
anomaly
and
observe
skills
and
strategies
that
can
be
applied
in
future
complex
cases
its
good
at
both
ends
of
the
airplane
he
said
its
really
important
to
have
these
kinds
of
cases
at
an
institution
of
top
specialists
like
childrens
so
when
the
next
case
comes
along
clinicians
have
the
experience
and
knowledge
to
handle
it
dumanels
surgery
involved
several
procedures
each
one
of
which
would
be
considered
a
major
operation
said
childrens
neurosurgeon
ed
smith
it
was
a
real
skullbuster

no
pun
intended

to
put
together
the
steps
and
sequence
of
events
he
said
it
was
the
encephalocele
that
brought
dumanel
to
boston
but
once
he
arrived
a
routine
brain
scan
showed
that
the
right
side
of
his
brain
had
been
all
but
taken
over
by
an
arachnoid
cyst
a
great
bubble
of
fluid
surrounded
by
spider
weblike
tissue
that
normally
lines
the
brain
to
protect
it
his
doctors
got
the
scan
and
said
holy
moly
this
is
not
what
we
were
expecting
at
all
walton
said
smith
and
meara
first
had
to
decide
whether
to
operate
on
the
cyst
and
the
encephalocele
at
the
same
time
the
entire
neurosurgery
department
discussed
it
meara
said
and
decided
it
made
sense
smith
went
first
to
tackle
the
fluidfilled
cyst
imagine
he
said
a
big
balloon
filled
with
water
and
plopped
in
the
kitchen
sink
blocking
the
drain
what
we
did
was
cut
the
dome
of
the
balloon
away
so
there
was
a
big
pop
and
the
fluid
came
out
but
there
is
still
rubber
sitting
over
the
drain
at
the
bottom
of
the
sink
the
fluid
couldnt
drain
away
without
a
second
step
using
a
microscope
to
make
sure
he
was
preserving
important
tiny
parts
of
dumanels
brain
such
as
the
optic
nerve
he
created
a
new
drainage
system
so
fluid
could
flow
properly
down
into
the
brain
stem
and
spinal
cords
drainage
pathway
then
meara
and
smith
focused
on
the
encephalocele
cutting
away
the
pale
nonfunctional
brain
tissue
that
bulged
out
of
dumanels
face
and
repairing
the
dura
the
brains
lining
with
the
lump
gone
meara
had
to
rebuild
dumanels
skull
he
moved
pieces
of
it
around
and
fit
them
together
like
an
anatomical
jigsaw
puzzle
he
created
a
nasal
bone
and
new
forehead
bone
for
dumanel
where
the
encephalocele
hole
had
been
and
moved
dumanels
eye
sockets
closer
together
where
gaps
remained
he
filled
them
in
with
fragments
of
bone
in
this
a
babys
skull
is
far
superior
to
a
jigsaw
puzzle
once
the
pieces
are
in
place
they
will
eventually
fuse
together
into
a
smooth
whole
in
older
patients
there
is
no
such
fusing
in
general
dumanels
risk
for
complications
was
high
from
a
surgical
glitch
to
an
infection
but
smith
and
meara
sound
like
they
are
pinching
themselves
as
they
report
on
dumanels
health
to
date
im
just
pleased
as
punch
with
how
hes
done
smith
said
im
hopeful
that
he
will
have
fully
normal
function
as
a
completely
normal
kid
when
he
grows
up
dumanels
left
side
remains
slightly
weak
from
the
cyst
but
im
sure
with
some
therapy
hell
be
fine
said
dr
hermide
mercier
who
has
been
hosting
dumanel
and
almane
at
her
brockton
home
as
dumanel
recovers
hes
moving
more
than
he
used
to
she
said
now
hes
all
over
the
house
pulling
himself
up
thats
a
big
change
da
da
da
said
dumanel
who
turned
1
in
september
ba
almane
27
has
been
calling
dumanels
mother
louisinette
every
day
he
said
and
she
practically
shouts
come
home
dumanel
is
the
couples
only
child
last
wednesday
meara
checked
over
dumanel
for
the
last
time
and
began
to
arrange
for
followup
care
through
partners
in
healths
haiti
clinics
when
you
want
to
go
home
he
told
almane
in
spanish
their
common
language
its
possible
almane
looked
upward
i
thank
god
first
he
said
and
then
looked
at
meara
and
you
second
almane
hopes
dumanel
will
grow
up
to
help
him
work
on
his
leased
farm
where
he
raises
rice
corn
and
potatoes
before
he
couldnt
do
anything
almane
said
now
he
can
do

said

its

they
could
avoid
some
of

poking
and
probing
of
a
traditional
colonoscopy
by
opting
for
a
virtual
version
of
the
test

a
hightech
xray
of
the
belly
that
is
designed
to
provide
identical
information
after
years
of
study
virtual
colonoscopies
appear
closer
than
ever
to
widespread
adoption
with
a
federal
advisory
panel
scheduled
later
this
month
to
review
evidence
on
the
test
a
review
that
could
prove
pivotal
as
health
plans
decide
whether
to
pay
for
the
screening
theres
widespread
agreement
that
virtual
colonoscopies
track
down
the
most
dangerous
polyps

the
harbingers
of
cancer

just
as
well
as
the
moreinvasive
test
i
may
get
tarred
and
feathered
for
this
but
im
actually
pretty
enthusiastic
about
the
potential
of
virtual
colonoscopy
said
dr
patrick
lynch
a
gastroenterologist
at
md
anderson
cancer
center
in
houston
it
has
tremendous
promise
as
a
screening
tool
so
long
as
a
few
ifs
ands
or
buts
are
taken
into
account
two
major
concerns
linger
one
is
the
exposure
to
radiation
that
comes
with
any
xray
another
is
whether
the
extra
images
generated
by
the
virtual
test

pictures
of
the
kidney
liver
and
pancreas

could
lead
to
unnecessary
testing
but
if
the
virtual
colonoscopy
prompts
more
people
to
be
screened
those
concerns
may
be
offset
colon
cancer
kills
more
americans
an
estimated
50000
this
year
than
any
other
form
of
the
disease
except
for
lung
cancer
yet
barely
half
of
the
patients
who
doctors
say
should
be
screened

essentially
anyone
50
or
older

submit
to
testing
we
have
a
huge
untapped
unscreened
source
of
patients
said
dr
judy
yee
a
radiologist
at
the
university
of
california
san
francisco
we
have
to
keep
our
eye
on
the
ball
which
is
preventing
colon
cancer
in
americans
all
screening
methods
for
colon
cancer
including
comparatively
primitive
stool
tests
share
the
same
premise
find
and
remove
polyps
before
they
turn
malignant
there
has
never
been
a
goldstandard
study
proving
that
colonoscopy
extends
lives
that
would
require
not
testing
a
comparison
group
which
some
see
as
unethical
but
it
has
been
very
strongly
demonstrated
that
if
you
take
out
polyps
you
reduce
the
risk
of
colon
cancer
said
dr
david
forcione
a
massachusetts
general
hospital
gastroenterologist
for
decades
that
has
meant
that
as
americans
crest
50
theyre
offered
two
things
an
aarp
membership
and
a
colonoscopy
before
the
colon
cancer
test
patients
quaff
a
drink
designed
to
empty
the
intestines
for
many
the
worst
part
is
drinking
the
foul
fluid
and
the
diarrhea
that
follows
to
perform
the
test
a
doctor
snakes
a
thin
flexible
tube
through
the
twisting
highways
of
the
colon
a
lilliputian
camera
is
attached
to
the
end
of
the
tube
to
look
for
evidence
of
cancer
or
polyps
anything
that
can
become
cancerous
is
removed
given
the
contorted
geography
of
the
intestines
the
tube
can
perforate
the
colon
studies
estimate
that
happens
to
as
many
as
2
of
every
1000
patients
i
think
thats
another
reason
people
are
hesitant
about
having
a
colonoscopy
syngal
said
another
reason
the
sedation
given
to
patients
to
keep
them
still
sedation
is
not
trivial
said
dr
carl
jaffe
of
the
national
cancer
institute

in
part
because
it
means
groggy
patients
need
help
getting
home
given
those
drawbacks
there
was
considerable
interest
in
developing
an
alternative
enter
the
virtual
colonoscopy
known
in
medical
lingo
as
computed
tomographic
ct
colonography
one
recent
afternoon
dr
michael
zalis
sat
in
a
darkened
suite
at
mass
general
packed
with
dozens
of
flickering
computer
monitors
with
hands
that
navigate
the
computer
like
a
piano
keyboard
zalis
a
radiologist
reviewed
images
from
a
recent
virtual
colonoscopy
first
twodimensional
blackandwhite
snapshots
of
the
patients
midsection
appear
then
a
computer
program
assembles
those
images
into
a
threedimensional
ride
through
the
fleshhued
cave
of
the
intestines
as
zalis
looks
for
signs
of
trouble
nothing
nothing
nothing

until
he
reaches
one
spot
where
theres
a
glowing
green
blob
could
it
be
a
polyp
by
rotating
the
image
he
determines
it
is
simply
fecal
matter
if
something
suspicious
does
appear
on
the
scan

and
specialists
said
that
happens
in
about
10
to
15
percent
of
cases

the
patient
would
need
a
regular
colonoscopy
to
confirm
the
result
and
potentially
remove
polyps
thats
not
such
a
big
deal
if
it
can
all
be
done
on
the
same
day
but
if
not
the
patient
has
to
endure
another
bowelcleansing
episode
this
may
seem
minor
but
if
you
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
patient
its
not
easy
said
lynch
the
houston
gastroenterologist
that
inconvenience
aside
the
virtual
test
is
nearly
as
reliable
as
the
traditional
method
in
detecting
the
polyps
most
likely
to
threaten
the
health
of
patients
researchers
reported
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
but
the
tests
accuracy
diminished
with
the
size
of
polyps
and
the
question
you
can
argue
over
and
over
again
is
are
these
small
polyps
significant
do
they
need
to
be
taken
out
forcione
said
there
is
specialists
said
no
agreement
on
those
points
an
independent
panel
of
scientists
that
reviews
evidence
on
disease
prevention
said
last
month
that
it
remains
undecided
on
whether
virtual
colonoscopy
should
be
used
routinely
specifically
the
us
preventive
services
task
force
said
it
could
not
find
evidence
to
erase
worries
about
the
potential
for
unnecessary
testing
and
radiation
exposure
zalis
dismissed
the
first
concern
radiologists
usually
can
distinguish
whats
worrisome
on
other
organs
he
said
meaning
few
patients
require
further
review
as
for
radiation
specialists
said
exposure
is
less
of
a
concern
for
adult
patients
and
the
radiation
amount
is
so
slight
said
zalis
as
to
pose
zero
harm
ron
dow

when

colon
screening
when
researchers
at

clinics
arizona
outpost
asked
if
he
would
like
one
of
the
newfangled
tests
he
said
sure
the
scan
showed
something
suspicious
a
traditional
test
was
done
and
later
a
cancerous
growth
was
removed
all
things
considered
he

the

the

his

that
would
be
shortlived
if
he
didnt
then
have
the
substance
to

up
he

he

the

chittick
first
became
aware
of
aids
in
the
1980s
when
he
owned
an
art
gallery
on
beacon
hill
and
saw
this
mysterious
disease
that
nobody
understood
wreaking
havoc
on
many
young
artists
when
one
of
his
business
partners
tearfully
told
him
that
hed
acquired
the
virus
chittick
understood
so
little
about
how
hiv
was
spread
that
he
was
afraid
to
give
him
a
hug
chittick
sold
his
business
went
back
to
school
at
harvard
to
work
on
a
model
for
hiv
education
earned
a
masters
and
doctorate
in
education
and
was
lecturing
at
the
harvard
school
of
public
health
in
the
mid90s
when
he
realized
that
his
place
was
not
in
the
classroom
it
was
he
realized
with
teenagers
he
says
he
takes
little
pride
in
the
fact
that
his
harvard
thesis
argued
correctly
that
hiv
would
soon
become
a
big
problem
for
the
young
in

he

yes
its

there
are
about

of

in

ranging
in
age
from
16

70something
representing
a
wide
variety
of
sizes
shapes
and
fitness
levels
we
come
from
all
walks
of
life
and
gather
in
groups
of
about
25
to
lunge
and
chasse
kickbox
and
shimmy
in
an
effort
to
turn
back
the
hands
of
time

and
hang
on
to
our
last
threads
of
sanity
the
routines
are
great
fun
and
they
work
fairly
soon
after
starting
class
i
began
to
notice
a
difference
in
my
fitness
level
but
the
endorphin
high
isnt
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
coming
back
my

are
the
most
amazing
group
of
people
they
are
welcoming
and
fun
and
never
fail
to

me
when
i

to

lets
get

started
she
called
me
on

to
dance
with
her
and
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
response
of
the
class
as
they
cheered
for
my
milestone
ill
never
know
fame
but
for
those
3
minutes
and
49
seconds
i
was
on
top
of
the
world
that
sense
of
camaraderie
was
very
much
in
evidence
again
this
past
summer
as
three
of
our
group
took
the
plunge
to
become
instructors
in
class
as
they
repeatedly
practiced
their
audition
routines
we
all
offered
as
much
encouragement
as
we
could
then
cheered
as
one
by
one
they
received
their
certifications
outside
of
class
many
of
the
women
are
wives
and
mothers
some
also
care
for
elderly
parents
and
hold
down
demanding
jobs
but
still
find
time
to
help
out
at
their
childrens
schools
their
houses
of
worship
and
in
the
community
indeed
they
give
freely
and
happily
of
themselves
time
and
again
without
seeking
recognition
for
their
actions

what
does
it
take
to
brew
a
tank
of
biofuel
at
the
mascoma
corp
lab
the
recipe
might
include
a
dash
of
enzymes
from
termite
guts
elephant
stomach
mixed
with
yeast
a
load
of
pulverized
switch
grass
or
paper
sludge
and
a
few
days
of
fermentation
anything
goes
here
as
scientists
try
to
find
a
quicker
cheaper
way
to
make
cellulosic
ethanol
a
second
generation
biofuel
that
uses
nonfood
plant
residue
and
other
waste
as
its
main
ingredients
instead
of
corn
or
soy
the
key
is
splicing
together
the
right
combination
of
genes
such
as
those
found
in
termites
or
an
elephant
stomach
to
create
a
super
bug
capable
of
producing
cellulosedigesting
and
sugarfermenting
enzymes
that
will
help
to
streamline
the
brewing
process
from
four
steps
to
one
dont
ask
how
did
you
get
something
that
used
to
be
in
an
elephant
stomach

id
like

driving

by

year
with

jamerson
said
if
successful
mascomas
biofuel
could
be
a
locally
produced
substitute
for
gasoline
made
out
of
petroleum
as
well
as
for
gas
alternatives
made
from
food
crops
such
first
generation
biofuels
have
come
under
fire
because
crops
that
once
fed
people
were
being
used
to
make
fuel
possibly
driving
up
food
costs
and
producing
more
greenhouse
gases
than
first
thought
environmentalists
say
mascomas
biofuel
looks
promising
because
it
has
the
potential
to
be
both
affordable
and
sustainable
one
of
the
big
things
theyre
doing
is
making
it
possible
to
use
a
lot
of
different
materials
like
grasses
or
wood
chips
said
jeremy
martin
a
senior
scientist
with
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
a
nonprofit
group
in
cambridge
and
it
appears
mascoma
is
asking
questions
that
martin
said
early
biofuel
makers
often
did
not
ponder
such
as
where
do
those
materials
come
from
and
whats
the
impact
of
getting
them
but
commercial
production
of
an
environmentally
friendly
costcompetitive
biofuel
like
the
one
mascoma
is
developing
is
still
years
away
according
to
the
state
task
force
it
estimates
that
by
2025
the
biofuels
industry
could
add
up
to
1
billion
a
year
to
the
massachusetts
economy
and
create
up
to
4000
jobs
challenges
include
getting
production
and
fueldistribution
facilities
running
and
making
vehicles
powered
by

mascoma
researchers
in

takes
less

for

from
50
cents
to
1
or
more
for

joan

an
excellent
student
says
strianese

straight

there
was
so
much
work
i
really
felt
like
id
been
hit
by
a
train
that
first
week
says
dembinski
but
going
back
to
school
wasnt
as
big
a
shock
for
her
as
it
might
have
seemed
to
someone
else
who
had
been
for
example
a
stayathome
mom
and
grandmother
for
decades
as
a
manager
involved
in
clinical
drug
trials
from
1959
until
her
retirement
in
january
just
before
school
started
research
and
reportwriting
were
skills
dembinski
had
honed
for
decades
i
could
always
tell
which
were
her
essays
in
winetasting
class
says
strianese
she
was
the
only
student
who
used
chemical
symbols
when
writing
about
the

made
over

of
visits
to

break
in

after
graduating
from

holyoke
college
dembinski
applied
to
albany
medical
college
intending
to
go
into
surgery
they
told
me
theres
no
place
for
a
woman
in
surgery
well
give
you
all
this
training
then
youll
leave
to
get
married
and
have

she
says
she
never
married
or
had
children
instead
of
going
to
med
school
dembinski
took
a
job
in
drug
research
at
sterlingwinthrop
research
institute
in
east
greenbush
ny
she
stayed
for
28
years
then

post
at

clinical
researchs
local
office
also
in
east
greenbush
finishing
as
a
manager
of

a
job
with
a
sixfigure
salary
now
shes
a
student
again
earning
a
couple
of
dollars
more
per
hour
than

though
if

shed
work
for
free
donna
purnomo
who
with
her
chefhusband
owns
yonos
and
is
its
pastry
chef
says
she
said
to
me
miss
donna

she
always
calls
me
miss
donna
even
though
she
was
in
high
school
when
i
was
born

i
shouldnt
be
paid
im
just
an
apprentice
but
we
insisted
she
deserves
it
although
dembinski
is
an
expert
home
cook
she
recognized
gaps
in
her
knowledge
anybody
can
cook
but
i
needed
to
go
back
to
school
to
learn
things
i
didnt
know
she
says
including
sanitary
techniques
diningroom
service
and
cooking
for
banquets
she
doesnt
envision
opening
her
own
restaurant
nor
does
she
delude
herself
that
she
could

or
would
want
to

spend
10hour
days
throwing
saute
pans
around
a
hot
line
or
grilling
meat
on
a
broiler
but
she
loves
being
in
a
professional
kitchen
and
has
quickly
proven
herself
an
able
member
of
the
yonos
team
she
even
has
a
nickname
as
do
many
of
the
restaurants
employees
a
bearish
cook
is
known
as
manimal
another
fellow
named
brian
is
called
no
2
because
a
brian
was
already
on
staff
when
he
was
hired
and
dembinski
is
betty
white
after
the
sparky
octogenarian
actress
dembinski
landed
the
job
a
couple
of
months
ago
when
she
stopped
in
at
the
restaurant
to
meet
the
purnomos
who
were
to
be
honored
at
an
upcoming
sccc
fundraising
dinner
because
yonos
regularly
opens
its
kitchen
to
culinary
students
for
brief
visits
donna
purnomo
casually
offered
dembinski
a
chance
to
watch
and
help
dembinski
replied
how
about
tomorrow
night
donna
purnomo
admits
she
at
first
thought
she
would
be
indulging
a
sweet
old
ladys
harmless
passing
fancy
but
dembinski
acquitted
herself
it
was
obvious
that
this
was
somebody
whos
very
bright
says
purnomo
i
didnt
have
to
tell
her
anything
twice
whatever
i
said
to
her
shed
say
understood
and
she
did
she
just
got
it
soon
after
dembinski
started
at
yonos
she
called
purnomo
at
home
and
volunteered
to
make
more
of
a
dessert
that
was
running
low
says
purnomo
i
came
in
the
next
day
and
the
bread
pudding
could
not
have
been
better
if
id
made
it
myself
after
dembinski
graduates
in
the
spring
with
an
assistant
chefs
certificate
shes
hoping
for
a
permanent
position
in
a
kitchen
working
in
a
restaurant
would
be
fun
she
says
remember
where
i
am
agewise
its
so
important
to
pursue
your
passions
thats
why
i
go
to
italy
as
a
restorative

on
the
beach
at

with
that
adriatic

im
hungering
for
that
right
now

a
place
in

how
important
it
is

a
poem
ellie
and
john
mckey
fell
in
love
dancing
on
ice
and
judges
of
competitions
swooned
while
watching
the
couple
it
was
like
a
perfect
duet
john
mckey
said
of
dancing
with
his
wife
it
was
a
matter
of
harmony
of
communication
that
was
what
was
so
wonderful
the
mutuality
of
movement
and
to
do
it
to
beautiful
music
in
a
room
filled
with
other
dancers
that
were
beautifully
dressed

the
men
in
their
tails
the
ladies
in
their
ball
gowns

it
was
elegant
often
the
mckeys
were
the
most
elegant
couple
on
the
ice
rink
or
the
dance
floor
as
they
won
eight
regional
national
and
north
american
amateur
competitions
for
seniors
mrs
mckey
who
met
john
on
a
skating
rink
in
the
early
1970s
died
oct
10
in
her
brookline
home
of
complications
from
a
stroke
she
was
80
and
also
shared
a
home
with
her
husband
in
vero
beach
fla
she
had
a
wealth
of
spirit
a
lovely
easy
wisdom
her
husband
said
she
knew
what
to
do
and
when
to
do
it
and
how
to
do
it
and
she
did
it
all
with
such
grace
with
such
a
lovely
appreciation
for
what
was
good
and
beautiful
in
life
the
two
met
after
mrs
mckey
was
widowed
and
decided
to
pursue
skating
something
she
had
wished
to
do
as
a
girl
before
marriage
and
motherhood
one
evening
she
was
at
the
skating
club
of
boston
on
the
ice
during
the
time
set
aside
for
families
and
she
did
a
beautiful
little
three
jump
in
front
of
me
her
husband
said
i
can
see
it
as
clearly
now
as
the
day
i
met
her
she
was
wearing
a
lovely
turquoise
green
skating
dress
with
a
mandarin
collar
i
asked
her
if
she
would
skate
around
the
rink
with
me
and
she
did
they
conversed
through
dinner
and
cocktails
and
through
the
structured
ice
dancing
session
that
followed
into
the
evening
they
talked
and
we
found
we
had
so
much
in
common
he
said
we
courted
for
about
a
year
and
then
we
were
married
and
we
had
almost
36
years
together
it
was
a
great
gift
eleanor
crocker
grew
up
in
manchesterbythesea
and
was
married
to
edward
a
taft
jr
who
became
executive
director
of
the
new
england
aquarium
they
lived
in
manchester
where
they
raised
their
sons
edward
and
david
at
42
edward
taft
jr
was
driving
home
from
worcester
in
1967
when
he
died
in
a
car
accident
on
the
massachusetts
turnpike
when
the
aquarium
officially
opened
two
years
later
his
widow
and
two
sons
cut
the
ceremonial
ribbon
of
seaweed
in
1973
the
mckeys
married
and
for
the
next
quarter
century
were
among
the
top
amateur
dancers
on
ice
and
on
the
floor
they
were
new
england
senior
champions
in
ice
dancing
three
times
and
their
training
led
them
from
the
rink
to
the
dance
floor
their
coach
was
cecilia
colledge
an
olympic
silver
medalist
who
had
moved
from
her
home
in
england
to
boston
she
thought
it
would
amplify
our
presentation
on
the
ice
if
we
learned
the
international
style
of
ballroom
dancing
john
mckey
said
so
off
we
went
and
took
lessons
then
a
back
injury
prevented
him
from
skating
with
enough
precision
for
competitions
and
the
mckeys
turned
their
attention
to
the
ballroom
the
male
partner
is
the
leader
but
john
mckey
said
he
often
felt
as
if
she
guided
them
around
the
dance
floor
through
the
purity
of
her
enthusiasm
the
letters
i
have
been
reading
about
her
all
speak
of
her
lovely
smile
and
the
delicious
laugh
she
had
and
the
joy
she
had
in
what
she
was
doing
especially
when
she
was
dancing
he
said
she
just
entered
into
her
own
world
at
that
point
and
brought
me
along
with
her
she
was
a
wonderful
partner
she
knew
what
i
wanted
to
do
even
before
i
had
thought
what
was
next
he
added
that
another
expression
that
comes
up
in
the
letters
is
that
she
was
such
a
lady
she
was
so
poised
on
the
ballroom
floor
in
a
competition
i
never
saw
her
get
rattled
and
people
loved
watching
her
she
had
many
fans
among
the
fans
were
the
judges
of
amateur
ballroom
dancing
competitions
the
mckeys
won
the
us
senior
championship
four
times
and
the
north
american
championship
once
practicing
was
never
a
chore
they
danced
for
two
hours
each
morning
and
frequently
wed
be
out
dancing
for
two
hours
at
various
ballroom
dance
practices
held
at
different
studios
or
even
at
old
moseleys
on
the
charles
which
had
a
wonderful
dance
floor
sharing
the
floor
with
couples
less
experienced
called
for
some
restraint
however
we
had
to
be
very
careful
he
said
with
a
laugh
if
it
was
a
crowded
floor
we
moved
with
such
speed
and
covered
such
distances
that
they
would
have
murdered
us
if
we
hadnt
behaved
they
competed
until
the
mid1990s
then
continued
to
give
the
occasional
dance
demonstrations
the
mckeys
shared
other
passions
too
they
painted
together
studied
french
and
traveled
to
france
i
miss
her
so
and
wish
she
was
here
but
we
had
such
a
full
beautiful
beautiful
life
together
he
said
we
were
very
lucky
we
were
fortunate
we
found
each
other
when
the
time
was
right
for
each
of
us

wondered

privileged
class
did
he
consort
with
and
champion
the
causes
of
the
masses
the
question
was
not
just
why
was
roosevelt
a
democrat

his
cousin
teddy
the
president
was
a
good
republican

but
why
was
he
involved
in
the
sordid
world
of
politics
in
the
first

pursuing
his
first
term

is
no

he
is
no
enemy
of
entrenched
privilege
he
is

without
any

qualifications
for

office
would
very
much
like
to
be

how
wrong
the

turned
out
to
be

except
the
part
about
fdr
wanting
to
be

nearly
a
century
after

political
rise
he
remains
a
historical
figure
carved

what

done

bring
to

to
humanize
a
man
and
his
circle
including

who
like
lincoln
led
the
country
at
one
of
its
most
critical
crossroads
brands
recently
answered
a
few
questions
for
the
expressnews
q
the
title
is
intriguing
why
was
fdr
a
traitor
to
his
class
a
the
wealthy
felt
roosevelt
was
selling
them
out
to
the
masses
preaching
cheap
populism
when
he
should
have
been
protecting
their
and
his
birthright
most
of
them
were
believers
in
trickledown
economics

the
wellbeing
of
the
rich
and
powerful
would
find
its
way
down
to
the
ordinary
folks
roosevelt
thought
this
was
backward

the
welfare
of
the
ordinary
folks
would
bubble
up
to
the
rich
q
when
you
set
out
to
write
a
biography
of
fdr
what
did
you
plan
to
achieve
there
are
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
books
on
fdr
what
about
the
man
hasnt
been
illuminated
a
i
wanted
to
answer
the
implicit
question
of
the
subtitle
how
did
a
son
of
privilege
become
the
sponsor
of
policies
that
radically
reshaped
the
landscape
of
american
politics
q
what
do
we
owe
fdr
how
would
this
country
be
different
if
he
hadnt
come
along
at
such
a
crucial
moment
in
our
history
and
im
thinking
first
the
great
depression
and
the
new
deal
and
second
world
war
ii
a
roosevelt
radically
reoriented
american
thinking
both
domestically
and
in
foreign
affairs
at
home
he
made
americans
believe
that
government
should
help
the
less
fortunate
and
those
who
through
no
fault
of
their
own
found
themselves
in
tough
straits
americans
still
believe
this
even
if
we
quibble
about
the
nature
of
this
help
in
foreign
affairs
roosevelt
attacked
the
isolationist
thinking
of
the
1930s
convincing
americans
that
their
own
safety
required
permanent
attention
to
the
affairs
of
the
world
as
with
domestic
affairs
this
conclusion
is
one
americans
have
never
seriously
reconsidered
even
60
years
later
q
you
must
have
done
a
mountain
of
research
for
the
book
was
there
something
that
completely
surprised
you
or
was
totally
out
of
character
with
the
image
you
held
of
the
man
a
many
public
figures
are
most
truly
themselves
when
they
act
speak
and
write
in
private
this
is
why
historians
spend
so
much
time
looking
at
old
letters
and
diaries
roosevelt
was
most
himself
in
public
roosevelts
press
conferences
and
fireside
chats
were
consistently
brilliant
pieces
of
political
theater

which
didnt
make
them
less
sincere


merely
more
effective
to
listen
to
his
fireside
chats
which
are
available
on
the
internet
and
to
read
the
transcripts
of
his
press
conferences
is
to
be
transported
to
a
time
when
the
occupant
of
the
oval
office
was
the
most
riveting
personality
in
the
country
q
if
fdr
was
alive
today
what
advice
do
you
think
he
would
have
for
both
presidential
candidates
a
he
would
tell
the
presidentelect
to
remember
who
hired
him
the
people
of
the
united
states
forget
the
lobbyists
forget
the
big
donors

put
the
people
first
and
all
will
come
right

devoted
to
the

still
craving
the
taste
of

we
drove
to
the
other

of
town
to
alvarado

where
we
feasted
on
the
best
pastrami
sandwich
on
either

at
langers
deli
we
were
greeted
by

was
the
perfect
way
to
see

the
fresh

we
drove
past

a
woodstockstyle
community

where
palatial
homes
hugged
the
shore
and
mountains
towered
on
the
other
side
of
the
highway
with
more
homes
dotting
the
hillsides
we
also
browsed
around
los

farmers
market
an
openair
market
established
in
1934
with
70
permanent
storefronts
offering
everything
from
international
cuisine
to
fresh

while

we
popped
over
to
the
mexican
food
stand
where
you
can
buy
a
bottle
of
the
real
classic
coke
we
discovered
a
stand
selling
the
hottest
sauces
in

and
stumbled
upon
purveyors
of
freshly
made
donuts
and
chocolate
and
all
types
of
israeli
and
jewish
delicatessen
food
we
also
discovered
that
you
dont
have
to
head
down
to
new
orleans
to
savor
the
flavors
of
the
gumbo
pot
which
offers
mouthwatering

like
gumbo
yaya

it
all
an

throughout
all

right
next

market
is
the

also
an

one
of

destinations
i
couldnt
drag
my

away
from

like
lucky

anthropologie
a

featuring
womens

dishware

and
nordstrom
where

by
such

was
a

even
the

garage
at
the

was
noteworthy
it
offered
valet
services
including
package
delivery
to
your

personal
shopping
it
was
just

but
acknowledged
that
a

could
wipe
them
out
leaving
all
floridians
on
the
hook
said
spokesman
tom
zutell
it

from

that

that
they

said
after

the

means

president
joe

said
the

are
based
on
the

insurance
to
cover

these
are
small
companies
but
they
have
substantial
capacity
because
of
reinsurance
petrelli
said
by
law
the
takeout
companies
must
offer
premiums
equal
to

lower
than

consumers
who
switch
to

gain
another
advantage
said
citizens
spokesman
john
kuczwanski
if
the
staterun
insurer
could
not
cover
losses
from
a

citizens
policyholders
would
be
the
first
assessed
to
cover
a

policyholders
under
private

would
be
second
the
takeouts
help
citizens
reduce
its
exposure
which
stands
at
437billion
for

he
said
zutell
of
the

noted
a
problem
in
this
for
citizens
the
takeouts
are
focusing
on
the
housing
stocks
creme
de
la
creme
leaving
most
of
the
worst
policies
with
citizens
if
you
are
a
company
taking
out

you
would
think
they
are
not
going
to
be
snatching
up
very

musical
adaptation
of
a
french
novel
about
a
disfigured
murderer
hiding
below
a

has
been
enchanting
audiences
since
1986
and
is
the
longestrunning
musical
on

even
if
youve
seen
the

50
times
its
easy
to
be
wowed
by
the
eerie
travels
across
a
fogshrouded
lake
the
elaborate

and
the
breathtaking

of

my

richard
smoked
cigarettes
for
50
years
having
failed
several
attempts
to
quit
on
his
own
when
a
friend
told
him
in
august
1994
that
hypnosis
had
enabled
her
to
quit
he
decided
to
give
it
a
try
it
didnt
work
i
wasnt
hypnotized
he
declared
after
his
one
and
only
session
but
it
did
work
since
that
day
he
has
not
taken

gloria
kanter
of

fla
thought
her
attempt
in
1985
to
use
hypnosis
to
overcome
her
fear
of
flying
had
failed
when
the
therapist
brought
me
out
i
said
it
didnt
work
she
recalled
in
an
interview
i
told
her
i
heard
everything
you
said
nonetheless
the
next
time
she
and
her
husband
headed
for
the
airport
she
was
not
drenched
in
sweat
and
paralyzed
with
fear
i
was
just
fine
she
said
and
ive
been
fine
ever
since
like
many
others
whose
knowledge
of
hypnotism
comes
from
movies
and
stage
shows
my
husband
and
kanter
misunderstood
what
hypnosis
is
all
about
while
in
a
hypnotic
trance
you
are
neither
unconscious
nor
asleep
but
rather
in
a
deeply
relaxed
state
that
renders
the
mind
highly
focused
and
ready
to
accept
suggestions
to
help
you
accomplish
your
goals
hypnosis
has
been
mired
in
controversy
for
two
centuries
and
its
benefits
are
often
overstated
it
does
not
help
everyone
who
wants
to
quit
smoking
for
example
then
again
neither
do
other
kinds
of
treatments
and
the
patients
attitude
is
critical
in
the
words
of
brian
alman
a
psychologist
who
practices
hypnosis
in
san
diego
the
power
of
hypnosis
actually
resides
in
the
patient
and
not
in
the
doctor
roberta
temes
a
clinical
hypnotist
in
scotch
plains
nj
insists
that
hypnosis
cannot
make
people
do
anything
they
dont
want
to
do
hypnosis
can
succeed
only
in
helping
people
make
changes
they
desire
she
said
in
an
interview
in
her
book
the
complete
idiots
guide
to
hypnosis
temes
points
out
that
success
in
achieving
your
goal
is
the
best
proof
that
you
were
really
hypnotized
she
also
suggests
a
second
or
third
session
if
you
didnt
quite
reach
your
goal
after
the
first
try
in
effect
hypnosis
is
the
epitome
of
mindbody
medicine
it
can
enable
the
mind
to
tell
the
body
how
to
react
and
modify
the
messages
that
the
body
sends
to
the

alman
said
that
useful
potential
for
benefiting
from
hypnosis
exists
within
each
patient
the
goal
of
modern
medical
hypnosis
he
said
is
to
help
patients
use
this
unconscious
potential
alman

a
65yearold
concentration
camp
survivor
who
repeatedly
choked
when
she
tried
to
swallow
though
examinations
of
her
esophagus
revealed
no
obstruction
after
three
hypnotherapy
sessions
her
problem
was
solved
i
was

from

the
patient
said
you
may
not
even
have
to
be

a

hypnosis
could
be
helpful
even
if
done
with
a
cassette
tape

cd

by

that
kept
detaching

that

sixth

she
used

the
tape
was

would

went

no

no

no

was
amazed

asked

i
had
done
differently
this
time
as
with
any
other
profession
some
hypnotherapists
are
more
talented
than
others
temes
suggests
that
word
of
mouth
may
be
the
best
way
to
find
someone
practiced
in
hypnosis
for
the
kind
of
problem
youre
trying
to
solve
also
helpful
is
the
american
society
of
clinical
hypnosis
at
wwwaschnet
which
maintains
a
referral
list
of
therapists
both
certified
and
not
by
location
and
specialty
while
not
everyone
is
easily
hypnotized
nearly
everyone
can
slip
into
a
therapeutic
trance
temes
maintains
another
of
her
patients
dr
susan
clarvit
a
new
york
psychiatrist
thought
she
could
not
be
hypnotized

she
was
too
scientific
too
rational
a
person
she
said
but
i
was
desperate
clarvit
said
in
an
interview
i
was
pregnant
with
my
second
child
and
too
nauseated
to
be
alive
dr
temes
asked
me
what
i
held
most
often
and
i
said
a
pen
she
hypnotized
me
so
that
when
i
held
a
pen
i
had
an
overall
feeling
of
wellness
i
held
a
pen
all
the
time
even
while
driving
and
didnt
feel
nauseated
under
hypnosis
clarvit
was
given
a
posthypnotic
suggestion
that
linked
holding
a
pen
to
feeling
well
such
suggestions
enable
people
to
practice
a
new
desired
behavior
after
being
brought
out
of
the
trance
someone
trying
to
overcome
snacking
on
sweets
might
be
told
when
you
are
hungry
you
will
eat
vegetables
the
suggestion
to
a
smoker
might
be
you
will
drink
water
when
you
want
a
cigarette
and
someone
terrified
of
public
speaking
might
be
told
you
will
do
deep
breathing
when
you
feel
scared
many
patients
are
also
taught
to
practice
selfhypnosis
to
reinforce
the
new
behavior
dr
karen
n
olness
a
professor
of
pediatrics
at
case
western
reserve
university
who
is
the
president
of
the
international
society
of
hypnosis
said
that
selfhypnosis
training
in
children
is
an
effective
and
practical
strategy
to
prevent
migraine
episodes
sometimes
patients
with
wellestablished
illnesses
can
benefit
indirectly
from
hypnosis
alman
told
of
a
woman
with
multiple
sclerosis
who
was
treated
with
hypnosis
for
depression
that
had
failed
to
improve
with
antidepressants
almost
immediately
he
reported
not
only
did
the
womans
depression
ease
but
her
gait
and
speech
improved
markedly
he
explained
that
for
many
patients
the
medical
problem
is
so
complex
that
specific
directions
and
commands
may
be
ineffective
the
benefit
from
hypnosis
may
rely
more
on
unleashing
unconscious
processes
within
the
patient
he
suggested
that
there
exists
a
wealth
of
material
in
the
patients
unconscious
that
can
be
used
in
healing
but
lamented
the
fact
that
although
medical
hypnosis
can
often
produce
rapid
change
even
in
difficult
cases
it
is
underutilized
as
a
therapeutic
tool
q
when
scum
is
skimmed
off
homemade
soup
what
nutrients
are
lost
a
soup
scum
consists
primarily
of
coagulated
protein
combined
with
fat
said
christina
stark
a
nutritionist
at
cornell
university
as
you
begin
making
soup
heat
causes
a
small
proportion
of
the
dissolved
meat
or
vegetable
proteins
to
coagulate
or
clump
up
in
new
ways
she
said
as
the
soup
continues
to
heat
oils
in
the
water
also
go
to
the
surface
and
combine
with
the
proteins
creating
the
foam
or
froth
you
see
we
get
plenty
of
those
nutrients
in
our
diets
she
said
so
skimming
the
scum
away
wont
lead
to
any
significant
nutrient
losses
she
pointed
out
that
if
taking
off
the
scum
entices
you
to
eat
a
larger
serving
of
clearer
and
more
appetizing
vegetable
soup
then
you
could
end
up
consuming
more
nutrients
than
if
you
left
the
scum
a
more
important
nutrient
loss
can
occur
in
the
vegetables
before
and
during
preparation
stark
said
vitamins
and
minerals
vary
in
their
sensitivity
to
environmental
factors
vitamin
c
is
watersoluble
and
is
sensitive
to
oxygen
light
and
heat
but
stable
in
acid
conditions
folic
acid
another
watersoluble
vitamin
is
unstable
in
acid
and
light
but
stable
when
exposed
to
oxygen
or
heat
minerals
and
fiber
are
generally
stable
in
all
these
conditions
so
for
example
if
the
broccoli
was
shipped
across
country
and
then
sat
for
days
on
the
store
shelf
or
at
home
before
being
used
there
may
be
significant
losses
of
vitamin
c
before
it
ever
gets
into
the
soup
she
said
but
the
good
news
with
soup
is
that
you
generally
consume
any
watersoluble
vitamins
that
have
leached
into
the
broth
stark
said
the
claim
soy
can
lower
cholesterol
the
facts
soy
foods
have
been
credited
with
all
sorts
of
health
benefits
but
perhaps
none
so
appealing
as
this
assertion
the
notion
was
cemented
in
1999
when
the
food
and
drug
administration
allowed
companies
to
claim
that
25
grams
of
soy
protein
a
day
in
a
diet
low
in
saturated
fat
and
cholesterol
may
reduce
the
risk
of
heart
disease
the
agency
evaluated
studies

including
an
industryfinanced
analysis
published
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
in
1995

concluding
that
soy
protein
could
cut
cholesterol
but
studies
since
have
raised
doubts
in
2006
an
american
heart
association
advisory
panel
reviewed
a
decade
of
studies
and
determined
that
soy
products
had
no
significant
effects
on
hdl
good
cholesterol
or
triglycerides
and
little
or
no
ability
to
lower
bad
cholesterol
or
ldl
another
study
published
in
august
in
the
american
journal
of
clinical
nutrition
found
that
consuming
24
grams
of
soy
protein
daily
had
no
significant
effect
on
plasma
ldl
in
people
with
mildly
elevated
cholesterol
but
the
issue
is
far
from
clearcut
another
line
of
research
shows
that
soy
seems
to
help
when
combined
with
foods
low
in
fat
and
high
in
fiber
and
the
compounds
called
plant
sterols

in
other
words
an
overall
healthy
diet
the
bottom
line
there
is
evidence
that
soy
can
improve
cholesterol
but
the
jury
is
still

a

there

fungus
may
be
cause
of
dieoffs
in
bats
researchers
say
something
is
killing
the
little
brown
bats
of
the
northeast
and
researchers
may
have
fingered
the
culprit
a
fungus
david
s
blehert
of
the
us
geological
surveys
national
wildlife
health
center
in
wisconsin
and
colleagues
identified
a
fungus
linked
to
whitenose
syndrome
a
condition
that
has
affected
bats
in
recent
winters
in
upstate
new
york
massachusetts
and
vermont
the
fungus
newly
described
is
unusual
in
that
it
grows
in
the
cold
dotting
areas
of
the
bats
skin
with
white
strands
it
penetrates
the
skin
through
hair
follicles
and
sweat
glands
and
may
cause
the
bats
to
starve
as
they
hibernate
the
researchers
said
we
do
have
good
circumstantial
evidence
that
this
could
be
the
primary
pathogen
causing
the
deaths
of
large
percentages
of
populations
of
little
browns
and
other
bats
in
caves
in
the
region
blehert
said
the
dieoffs
are
one
of
the
worst
calamities
to
hit
bat
populations
in
the
united
states
it
had
been
thought
that
the
fungus
was
a
secondary
symptom
of
whatever
was
killing
the
animals

a
virus
or
a
toxin
like
an
environmental
contaminant
but
the
fact
that
the
identical
organism
was
found
in
bats
from
several
caves
kind
of
rules
out
the
possibility
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
fungi
out
there
and
that
opportunistically
they
are
infecting
the
animals
said
alan
c
hicks
of
the
new
york
state
department
of
environmental
conservation
a
coauthor
of
a
paper
on
the
fungus
published
online
by
science
blehert
said
the
infection
could
have
led
to
starvation
because
of
the
way
bats
hibernate

they
cycle
through
twoweek
stages
of
deep
torpor
interrupted
by
brief
wakeful
periods
the
fungal
infection
may
make
the
bats
wake
up
more
often
and
since
each
period
of
wakefulness
uses
up
vast
stores
of
fat
the
bats
may
deplete
their
energy
reserves
much
sooner
than
normal
more
research
is
needed
to
determine
how
to
combat
the
dieoffs
but
one
thing
is
clear
blehert
said
just
spraying
a
cave
with
fungicide
could
do
more
harm
than
good
wiping
out
all
the
fungal
organisms
in
a
cave
probably
would
be
a
bad
idea
he
said
bacteria
on
the
move
eating
their
fill
bacteria
move
in
mysterious
ways
myxococcus
xanthus
for
example
a
harmless
soil
microbe
forms
rippling
swarms
by
the
millions
as
it
devours
other
microbes
as
prey
this
organized
backandforth
behavior
was
thought
to
occur
particularly
in
response
to
starvation
said
john
r
kirby
a
microbiologist
at
the
university
of
iowa
but
kirby
james
e
berleman
and
others
at
iowa
report
in
the
proceedings
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
that
m
xanthus
acts
this
way
in
response
to
food
and
uses
chemical
sensing
and
signaling
pathways
to
do
so
directed
bacterial
movement
that
is
controlled
in
this
way
is
known
as
chemotaxis
and
has
been
observed
in
individual
microbes
as
well
as
in
colonies
that
organize
into
biofilms
or
other
structures
because
m
xanthus
uses
chemotaxislike
pathways
to
move
over
its
prey
the
researchers
call
this
behavior
predataxis
a
video
is
at
nytimescomscience
the
swarming
changed
over
time
when
a
lot
of
e
coli
was
available
the
bacteria
moved
back
and
forth
tightly
kirby
likened
it
to
a
vacuum
cleaner
moving
repeatedly
over
a
dirty
spot
as
the
prey
was
consumed
the
pattern
lengthened
and
dissipated
presumably
the
bacteria
needed
to
release
a
lot
of
digestive
enzymes
at
first
but
less
and
less
as
time
went
on
he
said
further
study
of
this
kind
of
coordinated
behavior
may
help
in
understanding
certain
diseases
that
involve
motile
bacteria
kirby
said
and
in
developing
methods
to
clean
up
environmental
contaminants
using
microbes
commercial
production
of
chickens
takes
toll
on
genetic
diversity
to
the
connoisseur
of
fine
food
chicken
may
seem
depressingly
monotonous
no
matter
how
its
prepared
but
scientists
worry
about
a
more
basic
degree
of
sameness

a
lack
of
genetic
diversity
in
the
birds
that
are
raised
for
meat
and
eggs
an
analysis
of
commercial
chicken
populations
around
the
world
by
william
m
muir
of
purdue
university
and
colleagues
has
revealed
the
extent
of
the
problem
fifty
percent
or
more
of
the
diversity
of
ancestral
breeds
has
been
lost
they
report
in
the
proceedings
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
that
could
make
chicken
production
more
susceptible
to
disease
outbreaks
for
which
resistant
genes
have
disappeared
sampling
about
2500
birds
the
researchers
looked
at
several
thousand
instances
of
genetic
variation
and
used
that
to
estimate
what
a
hypothetical
ancestral
population
looked
like
genetically
then
we
were
able
to
say
what
is
missing
in
commercial
birds
muir
said
their
findings
indicate
that
most
of
the
diversity
was
lost
with
the
advent
of
widescale
commercial
production
in
the
1950s
only
a
handful
of
hundreds
of
breeds
have
been
crossed
to
produce
broilers
and
layers
muir
said
restoring
some
diversity
was
not
simple
a
matter
of
crossing
with
more
breeds

producers
would
lose
the
improvements
they
have
made
in
existing
lines
instead
one
approach
would
be
to
use
genetic
markers
to
aid
in
crossbreeding

select
for
the
parts
that
are

it

jake
replies
yeah
well
we
were
married
35
years
b
i
think
there
should
be
something
in

called
the
reindeer
effect
i
dont
know
what
it
would
be
but
i
think
itd
be
good
to
hear
someone
say
gentlemen
what
we
have
here
is
a
terrifying
example
of
the
reindeer
effect
c
if
you
saw
two
guys
named
hambone
and
flippy
which
one
would
you
think
liked
dolphins
the
most
id
say
flippy
wouldnt
you
youd
be
wrong
though
its
hambone
those
were
some
of
the
jokes
rated
by
nearly
300
people
in
boston
in
a
recent
study
you
can
rate
some
of
the
others
at
tierneylab
nytimescomtierneylab
the
researchers
picked
out
a
variety
of
jokes

good
bad
conventional
absurdist

to
look
for
differences
in
reactions
between
selfdescribed
liberals
and
conservatives
they
expected
conservatives
to
like
traditional
jokes
like
the
one
about
the
golfing
widower
that
reinforce
racial
and
gender
stereotypes
and
because
liberals
had
previously
been
reported
to
be
more
flexible
and
open
to
new
ideas
the
researchers
expected
them
to
get
a
bigger
laugh
out
of
unconventional
humor
like
jack
handeys
deep
thoughts
about
the
reindeer
effect
and
hambone
indeed
the
conservatives
did
rate
the
traditional
golf
and
marriage
jokes
as
significantly
funnier
than
the
liberals
did
but
they
also
gave
higher
ratings
to
the
absurdist
deep
thoughts
in
fact
they
enjoyed
all
kinds
of
humor
more
i
was
surprised
said
dan
ariely
a
psychologist
at
duke
university
who
collaborated
on
the
study
with
elisabeth
malin
a
student
at
mount
holyoke
college
conservatives
are
supposed
to
be
more
rigid
and
less
sophisticated
but
they
liked
even
the
more
complex
humor
do
conservatives
have
more
fun
should
liberals
start
describing
themselves
as
humorchallenged
to
investigate
these
questions
we
need
to
delve
into
the
science
of
humor
not
a
funny
enterprise
starting
with
two
basic
kinds
of
humor
identified
in
the
1980s
by
willibald
ruch
a
psychologist
who
now
teaches
at
the
university
of
zurich
the
first
category
is
incongruityresolution
humor
or
incres
in
humor
jargon
it
covers
traditional
jokes
and
cartoons
in
which
the
incongruity
of
the
punch
line
the
husband
who
misses
his
wifes
funeral
can
be
resolved
by
other
information
hes
playing
golf
you
can
clearly
get
the
joke
and
it
often
reinforces
stereotypes
the
golfobsessed
husband
ruch
and
other
researchers
reported
that
this
humor
with
its
orderly
structure
and
reinforcement
of
stereotypes
appealed
most
to
conservatives
who
shunned
ambiguity
and
complicated
new
ideas
and
who
were
more
repressed
and
conformist
than
liberals
the
second
category
nonsense
humor
covers
many
far
side
cartoons
monty
python
sketches
and
deep
thoughts
the
punch
lines
incongruity
isnt
neatly
resolved

youre
left
to
enjoy
the
ambiguity
and
absurdity
of
the
reindeer
effect
or
hambones
affection
for
dolphins
this
humor
was
reported
to
appeal
to
liberals
because
of
their
openness
to
ideas
and
their
tendency
to
seek
new
experiences
but
then
why
didnt
the
liberals
in
the
boston
experiment
like
the
nonsense
humor
of
deep
thoughts
as
much
as
the
conservatives
did
one
possible
explanation
is
that
conservatives
rigidity
mattered
less
than
another
aspect
of
their
personality
rod
martin
the
author
of
the
psychology
of
humor
said
the
results
of
the
boston
study
might
reflect
another
trait
that
has
been
shown
to
correlate
with
a
taste
for
jokes
cheerfulness
conservatives
tend
to
be
happier
than
liberals
in
general
said
martin
a
psychologist
at
the
university
of
western
ontario
a
conservative
outlook
rationalizes
social
inequality
accepting
the
world
as
it
is
and
making
it
less
of
a
threat
to
ones
wellbeing
whereas
a
liberal
outlook
leads
to
dissatisfaction
with
the
world
as
it
is
and
a
sense
that
things
need
to
change
before
one
can
be
really
happy
another
possible
explanation
is
that
conservatives
or
at
least
the
ones
in
boston
really
arent
the
stiffs
theyre
made
out
to
be
by
social
scientists
when
these
scientists
analyze
conservatives
they
can
sound
like
victorians
describing
headhunters
in
borneo
they
try
to
be
objective
but
its
an
alien
culture
the
studies
hailing
liberals
nonconformity
and
openness
to
ideas
have
been
done
by
social
scientists
working
in
a
culture
thats
remarkably
homogenous
politically
democrats
outnumber
republicans
by
at
least
seven
to
one
on
social
science
and
humanities
faculties
according
to
studies
by
daniel
klein
an
economist
at
george
mason
university
if
youre
a
professor
who
truly
seeks
new
experiences
try
going
into
a
faculty
club
today
and
passing
out
mccainpalin
buttons
could
it
be
that
the
image
of
conservatives
as
humorless
dogmatic
neurotics
is
based
more
on
political
bias
than
sound
social
science
philip
tetlock
a
psychologist
at
the
university
of
california
berkeley
who
reviews
the
evidence
of
cognitive
differences
in
his
2005
book
expert
political
judgment
said
that
while
there
were
valid
differences
liberals
and
conservatives
are
roughly
equally
closedminded
in
dealing
with
dissonant
realworld
evidence
so
perhaps
conservatives
dont
have
a
monopoly
on
humorless
dogmatism
maybe
the
stereotype
of
the
dour
rigid
conservative
has
more
to
do
with
social
scientists
groupthink
and
wariness
of
outsiders

which
come
to
think
of
it
resembles
the
herding
behavior
of
certain
hoofed
animals
ladies
and
gentlemen
what
we
have
here
is
a
terrifying
example
of
the
reindeer
effect
there
was
little
that
doctors
could
do
for
a
3yearold
boy
brought
to
bangkoks

rate

about
25

the

because

it

one
of
the
costliest
diseases
in
tropical

each

it
leads

though
it
is
the

common
cause
after

of
feverish
symptoms
for
western
tourists
returning

but
it
is
important
to
the
army
american
soldiers
have
contracted
dengue
as
recently
as
the
1990s
on
missions
in
haiti
and
somalia
so
it
is
one
of
the
tropical
diseases
that
are
the
focus
of
research
here
at
the

institute
of

more

development
in

fortunately
a
lot
of
our
concerns
are
also
global
health
concerns
for
many
years
the
leading
drugs
used
to
treat
malaria
were
developed
by
the
army
today
research
on
tropical
diseases
is
spread
across
a
broader
constellation
in
the
hunt
for
a
dengue
vaccine
money
and
research
have
come
from
the
thai
government
nonprofit
organizations
like
the

and
drug
companies
like
glaxosmithkline
which
is
working

the

is
being
jointly
developed
by
the
french
drug
company
sanofiaventis
and
a
thai
university
on
the
same
bangkok
street
as
the
army
lab
were
further
along
with
the
dengue

than
weve
ever
been
said
duane
j
gubler
director
of
the
emerging
infectious
diseases
department
of
the
dukenus
graduate
medical
school
in
singapore
theres
a
good
possibility
that
well
have
a
vaccine
in
five
to
seven
years
the
dengue
virus
is
transmitted
mainly
by
a
mosquito
called
aedes
aegypti
which
survives
on
human
blood
aedes
rarely
travels
more
than
about
100
yards
from
its
birthplace
and
thrives
in
populated
areas
the
mosquito
can
breed
in
something
as
small
as
a
soda
bottle
but
its
ideal
breeding
conditions
are
large
containers
common
in
many
parts
of
southeast
asia
to
store
drinking
water
unlike
other
mosquitoes
aedes
aegypti
prefers
clean
water
according
to
thomas
w
scott
a
professor
at
the
university
of
california
davis
who
is
a
leading
expert
on
the
species
the
mosquito
cannot
survive
freezing
weather
and
though
it
is
endemic
to
some
parts
of
the
united
states
mainly
the
south
experts
say
good
sanitation
practices
have
kept
it
from
spreading
the
dengue
virus
it
commonly
lives
inside
peoples
homes
lingering
in
closets
or
curtains
the
world
health
organization
estimates
that
50
million
people
are
infected
every
year
but
most
of
those
infected
perhaps
as
many
as
90
percent
experience
only
minor
flulike
symptoms
or
none
at
all
in
more
serious
cases
like
that
of
the
boy
who
died
here
last
month
symptoms
include
severe
headaches
rapid
onset
of
a
high
fever
debilitating
joint
and
muscle
pain
nausea
vomiting
and
internal
bleeding
generally
though
dengue
is
considered
treatable
as
long
as
patients
are
brought
to
the
hospital
on
time
and
the
disease
is
properly
diagnosed
scientists
believe
the
disease
has
existed
for
centuries

an
outbreak
appears
to
have
occurred
in
philadelphia
in
1780

but
dengue
has
become
more
common
and
more
virulent
over
the
past
halfcentury
in
1970
only
nine
countries
were
known
to
have
had
epidemics
of
the
most
serious
form
of
the
disease
dengue
hemorrhagic
fever
by
the
mid1990s
that
number
had
quadrupled
and
experts
say
the
disease
is
particularly
well
adapted
to
an
age
of
air
travel
and
international
trade
there
are
four
types
of
dengue
virus
patients
who
have
been
infected
with
one
of
them
are
believed
to
develop
immunity
to
that
type
only

and
paradoxically
are
more
vulnerable
to
dengue
hemorrhagic
fever
if
they
are
exposed
to
a
second
type
the
four
types
have
intermixed
as
people
carried
them
on
airplanes
to
farflung
places
outbreaks
of
the
hemorrhagic
fever
have
been
traced
to
specific
flight
paths
and
trade
routes
what
weve
done
is
provided
the
ideal
mechanism
for
these
viruses
to
move
around
the
world
said
gubler
who
has
researched
dengue
for
nearly
four
decades
it
was
probably
soldiers
who
caused
the
original
spread
of
dengue
hemorrhagic
fever
around
southeast
asia
during
world
war
ii
you
had
a
movement
of
soldiers
from
england
the
us
australia
and
japan
said
dr
suchitra
nimmannitya
a
pioneer
in
dengue
research
who
developed
a
handbook
on
how
to
treat
the
disease
soldiers
flew
from
city
to
city
a
japanese
scientist
first
isolated
the
virus
during
the
war
and
a
us
army
physician
albert
sabin
made
the
discovery
that
there
were
distinct
virus
types
sabin
went
on
to
help
develop
the
polio
vaccine
the
development
of
a
vaccine
is
especially
difficult
because
it
will
need
to
counter
all
four
types
of
virus
if
dengue
was
a
single
virus
we
would
have
had
a
vaccine
already
for
sure
said
dr
jean
lang
director
of
research
and
development
at
sanofis
emerging
vaccine
program
sanofis
dengue
vaccine
which
will
undergo
trials
in
4000
children
in
thailand
in
a
few
months
is
one
of
the
first
vaccines
to
be
produced
using
genetic
engineering
the
armys
vaccine
which
is
at
a
similar
stage
of
development
and
has
been
tested
on
volunteers
in
the
united
states
puerto
rico
and
thailand
was
produced
using
live
attenuated
viruses
a
more
traditional
technique
the
two
or
three
doses
spaced
months
apart
are
administered
by
injection
experts
say
the
wide
array
of
researchers
involved

some
with
profit
motives
and
others
without

increases
the
chances
of
success
and
could
help
make
the
vaccine
affordable
to
people
in
developing
countries

is
remarkably
chipper
on
a
recent
morning
while
visiting
new

pimm
a

was
full
of

stories
about

many

he
travels

madagascar
and

world
q
how
does
a
person
make
extinction
the
centerpiece
of
a
professional
life
pimm
in
1978
i
went
to
hawaii
supposedly
a
tropical
paradise
i
am
an
enthusiastic
birder
and
i
looked
forward
to
getting
into
the
lush
forest
to
view
the
abundant
flora
and
fauna
the
islands
were
famous
for
here
you
had
this
rich
island
chain
out
in
the
midst
of
the
pacific
full
of
wondrous
birds
and
plants

a
place
supposedly
richer
in
natural
diversity
than
even
the
galapagos
i
had
brought
with
me
field
guides
to
the
fauna
and
flora
all
published
in
the
early
1970s
yet
once
in
the
hawaiian
forest
i
had
a
shock
my
books
were
listing
species
that
were
extinct

or
about
to
become
so
i
was
in
the
forest
six
days
a
week
and
i
kept
thinking
if
i
give
it
enough
time
ill
certainly
see
most
of
the
species
still
left
but
i
saw
very
little
in
fact
in
hawaii
today
id
say
there
are
only
about
10
remaining
native
land
bird
species
with
another
10
clinging
to
survival
so
suddenly
this
extinction
business
seemed
very
real
whenever
youd
meet
biologists
over
coffee
thered
be
the
same
conversation
do
you
ever
wonder
what
hawaii
was
like
before
with
150
species
of
birds
and
1500
species
of
plants
that
changed
my
life
q
how
did
it
do
that
pimm
well
i
realized
that
extinction
was
something
that
as
a
scientist
i
could
study
i
could
ask
why
do
species
go
extinct
and
how
fast
does
it
happen
once
armed
with
that
information
one
might
do
something
about
it
i
now
spend
a
fair
amount
of
time
in
washington
working
for
laws
to
protect
species
i
train
young
people
to
do
the
same
i
often
tell
my
students
that
if
they
want
to
become
environmental
biologists
they
have
to
be
prepared
to
go
out
into
the
field
at
dawn
to
collect
their
data
and
then
dress
up
in
a
suit
in
the
afternoon
to
meet
the
visiting
politician
q
which
would
you
say
are
at
this
moment
the
most
endangered
of
the
worlds
creatures
pimm
there
are
too
many
to
name
something
like
12
percent
of
all
birds
a
third
of
all
amphibians
and
likely
similarly
large
numbers
of
plants
are
in
serious
danger
id
say
whats
more
about
1
percent
of
all
species
on
the
planet
are
in
such
trouble
that
if
we
dont
do
the
right
things
immediately
they
will
be
gone
in
a
decade
the
river
dolphin
in
china
was
declared
extinct
just
last
year
another
small
dolphin
in
the
sea
of
cortez
is
in
immediate
danger
q
what
can
one
person
do
to
stop
extinctions
pimm
one
of
the
things
ive
done
is
start
an
ngo

a
nongovernmental
organization

called
savingspeciesorg
and
it
does
what
its
title
suggests
weve
been
working
with
local
conservation
groups
and
governments
in
brazil
and
madagascar
doing
a
variety
of
projects
that
we
hope
will
halt
the
potential
extinctions
there
one
of
the
things
we
know
is
that
many
endangered
animals
live
over
large
areas
but
their
populations
become
fragmented
because
of
farming
and
development
the
remaining
creatures
cant
find
a
date
on
a
saturday
night
so
weve
been
trying
to
buy
up
degraded
land
around
their
broken
environments
and
try
to
create
land
corridors
for
the
wildlife
q
have
you
had
any
successes
yet
pimm
yes
on
the
atlantic
coast
of
brazil
weve
been
trying
to
help
save
the
golden
lion
tamarin
an
endangered
primate
about
the
size
of
a
house
cat
last
year
with
the
involvement
of
local
conservationist
groups
we
helped
purchase
about
270
acres
of
cattle
pasture
that
separated
two
patches
of
their
habitat
this
former
pasture
is
now
being
replanted
with
trees
the
two
areas
will
soon
be
bridged
and
it
will
be
possible
for
lonely
hearts
to
meet
members
of
the
opposite
sex
and
go
forth
and
multiply
in
another
south
american
region
i
wont
name
here
there
have
been
a
lot
of
illegal
logs
taken
why
because
a
local
godfather
there
was
getting
kickbacks
from
loggers
my
friends
and
i
decided
wed
give
him
a
bit
more
money
and
we
stopped
the
illegal
logging
i
may
burn
in
hell
forever
for
paying
protection
but
it
did
help
the
animals
and
the
indigenous
people
who
were
not
subjected
to
a
lot
of
bad
things
in
terms
of
what
we
got
for
the
money
it
was
a
very
good
deal
q
your
group
has
been
doing
a
lot
of
work
with
indigenous
tribes
why
is
that
important
pimm
because
when
you
set
aside
indigenous
reserves
it
reduces
deforestation
theres
another
project
in
northern
amazonia
that
my
group
has
been
involved
in
this
particular
area
is
inhabited
by
indigenous
peoples
who
have
clear
title
to
the
land
in
their
village
recently
settlers
came
into
the
area
wanting
to
turn
the
forests
outside
of
the
village

the
very
places
where
these
people
hunt
and
fish

into
rice
fields
their
claim
was
that
no
one
owned
the
forests
so
my
brazilian
students
and
a
local
catholic
mission
have
been
teaching
the
tribes
teenagers
the
use
of
modern
global
positioning
technologies

gps
the
idea
is
that
gps
can
help
them
record
where
they
hunt
and
fish
and
that
will
help
them
define
the
forest
land
as
theirs
so
heres
an
example
of
when
we
help
the
local
people
maintain
their
traditional
ways
were
helping
the
flora
and
the
fauna
survive
q
how
do
you
finance
savingspeciesorg
pimm
we
raise
money
in
the
traditional
way
but
were
also
selling
symbolic
carbon
offsets
to
sympathetic
donors
as
you
know
when
you
restore
forests
you
soak
up
co2
from
the
atmosphere
there
are
people
whod
like
to
be
carbon
neutral

theyd
like
not
to
burn
any
more
carbon
than
they
are
soaking
up
so
if
someone
buys
an
airline
ticket
and
feels
badly
about
all
the
carbon
theyre
putting
into
the
atmosphere
during
that
flight
we
sell
them
very
beautiful
very
cheap
offsets
from
the
forest
restoration
we
have
done
we
hope
that
this
kind
of
swap
will
eventually
become
a
financial
obligation
in
a
lot
of
the
world
q
are
you
religious
pimm
im
a
believing
christian
god
so
loved
the
cosmos
that
he
gave
his
only
son
thats
an
injunction
from
st
john
to
me
this
says
that
christians
have
an
obligation
to
look
after
the
world

stewardship
we
cannot
pointlessly
drive
species
to
extinction
and
destroy
forests
and
oceans
when
we
do
that
we
are
destroying
gods
creation
that
said
im
not
a
vegetarian
i
like
a
good
steak
now
and
then
do
i
go
out
and
slaughter
cattle
yep
a
new
virus
that
causes
fatal
hemorrhagic
fevers
has
been
discovered
in
southern
africa
it
killed
four
people
in
south
africa
and
sickened
a
fifth
but
health
authorities
believe
the
outbreak
has
been
contained
the
virus
is
a
member
of
the
arenavirus
family
which
also
includes
the
causes
of
lassa
fever
in
west
africa
and
several
south
american
fevers
while
new
viruses
are
often
found
in
animals

a
new
bluetongue
virus
was
found
in
swiss
goats
last
month
for
example

it
is
relatively
rare
to
discover
one
fatal
to
humans
like
the
sars
coronavirus
in
2002
or
the
sin
nombre
hantavirus
in
1993
how
the
first
victim
was
infected
is
unknown
but
arenaviruses
are
common
in
rodents
their
dried
urine
inhaled
while
sweeping
can
transmit
infection
confirmation
that
it
is
a
new
virus
was
made
by
the
national
institute
for
communicable
diseases
in
south
africa
and
by
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention
in
atlanta
the
first
victim
was
cecilia
van
deventer
a
safari
tour
booker
in
lusaka
zambia
who
fell
ill
on
sept
2
and
was
airlifted
to
johannesburg
she
apparently
infected
hannes
els
the
paramedic
who
accompanied
her
and
gladys
mthembu
a
nurse
tending
her
at
the
morningside
mediclinic
in
a
johannesburg
suburb
the
fourth
to
die
was
maria
mokubung
who
cleaned
the
room
where
van
deventer
died
sept
14
according
to
south
african
news
reports
the
last
death
was
originally
misdiagnosed
because
the
victim
had
tuberculosis
and
meningitis
and
was
hemorrhaging
and
confused
when
her
family
sought
medical
care
a
fifth
victim
a
nurse
who
cared
for
els
was
in
critical
condition
but
responded
to
early
treatment
with
the
antiviral
drug
ribavirin
the
disease
progresses
from
flu
symptoms
to
diarrhea
and
a
measleslike
rash
and
then
to
respiratory
and
circulatory
collapse
the
authorities
said
they
knew
of
no
new
cases
but
would
wait
until
21
days
from
the
last
infection
to
declare
the
outbreak
over
disease
detective
work
was
difficult
south
african
news
media
said
because
van
deventer
feared
needles
little
blood
was
drawn
from
her
in
zambia
also
her
body
was
cremated
before
the
alarm
was
raised
tissue
samples
from
later
victims
had
to
be
taken
carefully
in
a
highsecurity
laboratory
that
was
under
renovation
and
had
to
be
reopened
arenaviruses
are
named
for
their
round
sandy
granules
arena
is
latin
for
sand
a
name
for
the
new
virus
is
being
debated
zambian
authorities
do
not
want
one
that
will
hurt
tourism
according
to
a
government
news
service
zambias
first
response
to
the
outbreak
was
to
close
its
border
with
congo
the
former
zaire
where
ebola
fever
which
is
not
related
originated
still
puzzling
over
how
warm
and
wet
mars
may
have
once
been
scientists
are
now
seeing
global
mineralogical
signs
that
the
planet
was
at
least
occasionally
wet
for
the
first
2
billion
years
of
its
existence
in
an
article
in
the
november
issue
of
the
journal
geology
scientists
working
with
data
from
nasas
mars
reconnaissance
orbiter
report
that
they
have
spotted
widespread
deposits
of
opals
and
related
minerals
on
the
surface
of
mars
opals
belong
to
a
class
of
minerals
known
as
hydrated
silicas
with
water
molecules
wedged
into
siliconbased
minerals
like
quartz
the
formation
of
hydrated
silicas
requires
liquid
water
most
interesting
is
that
the
opal
deposits
lie
in
areas
that
appear
to
have
formed
only
about
2
billion
years
ago
previously
spacecraft
have
detected
other
waterbearing
minerals
like
clays
in
regions
that
date
back
more
than
35
billion
years
mars
like
the
other
planets
in
the
solar
system
is
about
45
billion
years
old
the
water
was
more
widespread
and
extended
to
younger
times
said
scott
l
murchie
a
staff
scientist
at
johns
hopkins
applied
physics
laboratory
and
the
principal
investigator
for
the
orbiters
spectrometer
which
found
the
opal
evidence
in
july
murchie
and
other
scientists
reported
that
the
orbiter
had
detected
vast
deposits
of
the
claylike
minerals
on
the
older
terrains
images
also
showed
ancient
lakebeds
with
accumulations
of
the
minerals
indicating
standing
water
persisted
for
thousands
of
years
the
presence
of
water
on
mars
has
been
known
for
many
years
its
ice
caps
easily
visible
from
space
are
largely
made
of
frozen
water
the
unanswered
question
is
how
often
the
ice
has
melted
the
phoenix
mars
lander
now
nearing
the
end
of
its
sixmonth
mission
is
exploring
whether
the
arctic
ice
has
melted
in
recent
millennia
the
most
intriguing
possibility
is
that
mars
when
it
was
less
than
a
billion
years
old
was
warm
enough
for
lakes
and
oceans
of
liquid
water

and
with
that
the
possibility
of
life
the
planets
landforms
offer
compelling
evidence
for
flowing
water
immense
canyons
and
channels
driedup
river
deltas
i
think
most
people
agree
there
was
lots
of
water
on
the
surface
in
the
first
few
hundred
million
years
said
maria
zuber
a
professor
of
geophysics
at
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
its
later
on
when
i
get
confused
although
im
confused
about
the
whole
thing
thats
what
makes
it
interesting
some
scientists
have
suggested
that
rare
catastrophic
floods
carved
the
landforms
either
in
the
aftermath
of
an
impact
by
an
asteroid
or
comet
or
by
underground
water

melted
by
residual
volcanic
warmth

bursting
to
the
surface
those
who
believe
that
liquid
water
was
more
persistent
were
nonetheless
perplexed
when
earlier
spacecraft
detected
only
small
quantities
of
carbonates
minerals
that
should
have
formed
in
large
amounts
from
reactions
involving
carbon
dioxide
and
liquid
water
but
data
collected
by
the
two
mars
rovers
spirit
and
opportunity
show
a
highly
acidic
environment
that
prevented
the
formation
of
carbonates
that
part
of
the
story
is
fairly
well
agreed
upon
zuber
said
the
two
rovers
have
also
found
signs
of
past
water
opportunity
found
hydrated
sulfates
in
the
meridiani
planum
rocks
spirit
found
opallike
minerals
similar
to
those
spotted
by
the
reconnaissance
orbiter
from
space
but
planetary
scientists
are
still
trying
to
explain
the
transition
of
mars
from
lots
of
water
to
todays
cold
and
dry
climate
in
fact
they
are
still
trying
to
explain
how
it
ever
had
lots
of
liquid
water
even
if
young
mars
was
enshrouded
in
a
thick
atmosphere
of
carbon
dioxide
belched
by
giant
volcanoes
climatologists
have
had
trouble
coaxing
enough
global
warming
in
their
computer
simulations
to
push
temperatures
above
the
melting
point
of
ice
james
f
kasting
a
professor
of
geosciences
at
penn
state
believes
he
may
have
figured
out
how
to
warm
up
mars
in
research
that
he
will
present
in
december
at
a
meeting
of
the
american
geophysical
union
the
key
may
be
nitrogen
dioxide
in
his
climate
models
carbon
dioxide
did
act
as
a
greenhouse
gas
trapping
heat
near
the
surface
but
it
also
reflected
shorter
wavelengths
of
light
back
into
space
limiting
the
amount
of
heating
his
models
peaked
at
about
minus40
degrees
fahrenheit
nitrogen
dioxide
which
is
also
released
by
volcanic
eruptions
reduces
the
reflectivity
of
mars
in
the
models
with
more
light
absorbed
temperatures
jumped
100
degrees
that
would
be
more
than
you
need
kasting
said
he
said
he
still
needed
to
demonstrate
that
the
nitrogen
dioxide
would
mix
throughout
the
atmosphere
rather
than
remain
in
pockets
around
the
volcanoes
even
if
scientists
figure
out
the
water
question
they
have
another
problem
what
happened
to
the
martian
air
the
climate
models
suggest
early
mars
had
an
atmosphere
denser
than
earths
now
its
a
faint
wisp
well
we
dont
know
zuber
said
one
day
were
going
to
nail
that
one
theres
a
whole
bunch
of
things
on
my
list
of
things
to
do
economists
health
researchers
and
consumers
are
struggling
to
answer
that
question
as
food
prices
rise
and
the
economy
slumps
the
world
bank
says
nearly
a
billion
people
around
the
world
live
on
a
dollar
a
day
or
even
less
in
the
united
states
the
daily
foodstamp
allowance
is
typically
just
a
few
dollars
per
person
while
the
average
american
eats
7
worth
of
food
per
day
even
middleclass
people
struggle
to
put
healthful
food
on
the
table
studies
show
that
junk
foods
tend
to
cost
less
than
fruits
vegetables
and
other
healthful
foods
whose
prices
continue
to
rise
this
fall
a
couple
in
encinitas
calif
conducted
their
own
experiment
to
find
out
what
it
was
like
to
live
for
a
month
on
just
a
dollar
a
day
for
food
overnight
their
diets
changed
significantly
the
budget
forced
them
to
give
up
many
storebought
foods
and
dinners
out
even
bread
and
canned
refried
beans
were
too
expensive
instead
the
couple

christopher
greenslate
28
and
kerri
leonard
29
both
high
school
social
studies
teachers

bought
raw
beans
rice
cornmeal
and
oatmeal
in
bulk
and
made
their
own
bread
and
tortillas
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
werent
an
option
leonards
mother
was
so
worried
about
scurvy
a
result
of
vitamin
c
deficiency
that
they
made
room
in
their
budget
for
tang
orange
drink
mix
they
dont
eat
meat

not
that
they
could
have
afforded
it
breakfast
consisted
of
oatmeal
lunch
was
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
dinner
often
consisted
of
beans
rice
and
homemade
tortillas
homemade
pancakes
were
affordable
but
syrup
was
not
a
local
restaurant
gave
them
a
few
free
syrup
packets
one
of
the
biggest
changes
was
the
time
they
had
to
spend
in
meal
preparation
if
youre
buying
raw
materials
youre
spending
more
time
preparing
things
greenslate
said
wed
come
home
after
working
10
to
11
hours
and
have
to
roll
out
tortillas
if
youre
already
really
hungry
at
that
point
its
tough
while
he
lost
weight
on
the
budget
diet
greenslate
said
the
larger
issue
was
his
lack
of
energy
during
the
experiment
he
was
no
longer
able
to
work
out
at
the
gym
a
few
times
they
found
a
bag
of
carrots
or
lettuce
that
was
within
their
budget
but
produce
was
usually
too
expensive
they
foraged
for
lemons
on
the
trees
in
their
neighborhood
to
squeeze
juice
into
their
water
leonard
said
that
after
the
30day
experiment
one
of
the
first
foods
she
ate
was
a
strawberry
i
almost
cried
she
said
the
couple
acknowledged
that
the
experiment
was
something
of
a
luxury
given
that
many
people
have
no
choice
about
how
much
to
spend
on
food
people
in
our
situation
have
the
leisure
to
be
concerned
about
issues
like
this
leonard
said
if
we
were
actually
living
in
this
situation
i
would
not
be
taking
the
time
to
be
concerned
about
what
i
could
and
could
not
have
id
be
worried
about
survival
researchers
say
the
experiment
reflects
many
of
the
challenges
that
poor
people
actually
face
when
food
stamps
and
income
checks
run
low
toward
the
end
of
the
month
they
often
do
scrape
by
on
a
dollar
a
day
or
less
but
many
people
dont
know
how
to
prepare
foods
from
scratch
or
lack
the
time
you
have
to
know
how
to
cook
beans
and
rice
how
to
make
tortillas
how
to
soak
lentils
said
adam
drewnowski
director
of
the
center
for
public
health
nutrition
at
the
university
of
washington
many
people
dont
have
the
knowledge
or
the
time
if
theyre
working
two
jobs
last
year
drewnowski
led
a
study
published
in
the
journal
of
the
american
dietetic
association
comparing
the
prices
of
370
foods
sold
at
supermarkets
in
the
seattle
area
the
study
showed
that
energy
dense
junk
foods
which
pack
the
most
calories
and
fewest
nutrients
per
gram
were
far
less
expensive
than
nutrientrich
lowercalorie
foods
like
fruits
and
vegetables
the
prices
of
the
most
healthful
foods
surged
195
percent
over
the
twoyear
study
period
while
the
junk
food
prices
dropped
18
percent
obesity
researchers
worry
that
these
trends
will
push
consumers
toward
less
healthful
foods
the
message
for
this
year
and
next
year
is
going
to
be
affordable

drewnowski
said
its
not

pyramid
its

the
poster
one
of
many
created
by
the
public
health
service
during
world
war
ii
to
warn
the
troops
about
the
dangers
of
casual
sex
is
on
display
as
part
of
a
retrospective
of
20thcentury
health
posters
from
the
permanent
collection
of
the
national
library
of
medicine
titled
an
iconography
of
contagion
the
exhibition
features
work
from
numerous
countries
on
an
array
of
diseases
among
them
syphilis
malaria
tuberculosis
and
aids
the
posters
are
on
display
at
the
national
academy
of
sciences
in
washington
through
dec
19
much
of
the
exhibition
suggests
a
mashup
of
advertising
and
public
health
the
posters
tried
to
convey
the
danger
of
disease
and
get
people
to
change
their
behavior
said
the
curator
michael
sappol
a
historian
at
the
library
of
medicine
part
of
the
national
institutes
of
health
but
theyre
also
about
the
pleasure
of
the
image
he
continued
adding
there
have
been
some
very
sexy
colorful
playful
posters
about
some
very
serious
diseases
the
visual
world
underwent
rapid
changes
in
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
centuries
newspapers
featured
larger
headlines
and
more
drawings
and
photographs
the
advertising
industry
integrated
text
and
images
and
it
turned
to
behavioral
science
to
sharpen
its
pitches
at
the
same
time
public
health
groups
like
the
national
tuberculosis
association
founded
in
1904
took
some
cues
from
advertising
and
began
to
rely
on
mass
communication
with
pamphlets
posters
and
later
films
and
radio
spots
for
diseases
like
tuberculosis
that
lacked
effective
treatments
efforts
to
promote
screening
and
change
peoples
behavior
were
especially
important
media
campaigns
were
themselves
seen
as
magic
bullets
sappol
said
in
an
iconic
poster
from
around
1940
a
mother
and
two
children
gather
around
an
armchair
smiling
as
the
father
reads
a
newspaper
an
urban
throng
in
monochromatic
red
appears
in
the
background
tuberculosis
undiscovered
endangers
you
discover
the
unknown
spreaders
reads
the
caption
at
the
time
many
people
who
had
tb
including
some
who
were
contagious
were
unaware
that
they
were
infected
said
dr
mary
e
wilson
an
associate
professor
of
global
health
and
population
at
the
harvard
school
of
public
health
a
large
number
of
them
were
identified
through
mass
screening
using
xrays
many
were
exposed
to
large
doses
of
radiation
that
would
be
unacceptable
today
she
added
another
poster
created
in
china
in
1935
was
intended
to
discourage
spitting
which
could
spread
tb
the
image
shows
a
man
in
traditional
dress
walking
past
a
group
of
playing
children
a
line
extends
from
the
mans
mouth
to
a
clump
of
spittle
on
the
ground
from
there
an
arrow
points
to
a
pool
of
pink
bacteria
magnified
under
a
microscope
the
caption
reads
in
part
tb
is
rampant
in
our
country
because
of
the
error
of
spitting
anywhere
this
is
unforgivable
it
continues
spit
into
a
handkerchief
and
boil
it
or
spit
into
paper
and
burn
it
this
not
only
ensures
virtue
but
is
a
gift
to
mankind
the
poster
includes
a
symbol
that
resembles
that
of
the
national
tuberculosis
association
in
the
united
states

a
vertical
line
with
two
horizontal
crosses
in
the
chinese
version
the
edges
of
the
cross
are
curved
upward
resembling
a
pagoda
a
similar
message
was
promoted
in
many
countries
in
a
danish
poster
from
1947
the
emphasis
is
on
screening
a
couple
shown
as
a
shadowy
form
with
green
and
red
highlights
strolls
arm
in
arm
wearing
hats
that
could
be
merry
or
devilish
tuberculosis
examination

a
citizens
duty
reads
the
text
the
poster
has
a
beautiful
creamy
texture
and
was
part
of
the
danish
enchantment
with
modernity
both
in
health
infrastructure
and
in
aesthetics
sappol
said
it
seduces
you
into
paying
attention
in
the
1960s
the
enchantment
with
health
posters
declined
at
least
in
the
united
states
there
was
a
general
feeling
among
the
public
that
weve
got
the
polio
vaccine
penicillin
ddt
and
other
magic
bullets
and
thats
going
to
conquer
disease
sappol
said
but
that
confidence
plummeted
in
the
1980s
and
1990s
with
hivaids
which
brought
about
a
renaissance
of
public
health
posters
said
john
parascandola
a
former
historian
for
the
public
health
service
activist
groups
like
act
up
and
gran
fury
in
the
united
states
and
the
terrence
higgins
trust
in
britain
campaigned
to
raise
awareness
about
the
disease
one
poster
from
the
mid1980s
shows
a
muscular
man
leaning
down
to
perform
oral
sex
on
a
partner
of
ambiguous
gender
a
tattooed
tiger
bulges
on
his
shoulder
the
poster
which
reads
discover
safer
sex
is
from
the
terrence
higgins
trusts
love
sexy
love
safe
campaign
the
text
notes
that
safer
sex
can
also
prevent
unwanted
pregnancy
suggesting
that
the
campaign
hoped
to
draw
in
heterosexuals
aids
posters
tended
to
be
less
moralistic
than
many
earlier
ones
said
wilson
who
noted
that
the
world
war
ii
campaigns
against
syphilis
and
gonorrhea
often
treated
the
woman
as
the
villain
the
temptress
and
men
almost
as
innocent
bystanders
by
contrast
she
said
while
aids
patients
were
often
stigmatized
in
the
broader
society
the
major
public
health
campaigns
tried
very
hard
to
work
against
that
stigma
ultimately
the
posters
tried
to
sell
ideas
to
specific
audiences
parascandola
said
they
were
a
compelling
form
of
advertising

and
perhaps
they
still
are
for
those
who
love
the
civic
cheer
and
lukewarm
coffee
of
their
local
polling
place
an
absentee
ballot
has
all
the
appeal
of
a
tax
form
the
paperwork
the
miniature
type
the
search
in
some
states
for
a
notary
public
its
a
tedium
bath
and
pam
fleischaker
a
lifelong
democrat
from
oklahoma
city
had
every
reason
to
take
a
pass
this
year
fleischaker
62
was
in
new
york
recovering
from
a
heart
transplant
for
one
and
in
her
home
state
the
democratic
candidate
sen
barack
obama
was
polling
hopelessly
behind
his
opponent
sen
john
mccain
she
mailed
in
her
absentee
packet
anyway
and
hounded
her
two
children
also
in
new
york
to
do
the
same
that
one
vote
isnt
going
to
be
decisive
makes
no
difference
to
me
fleischaker
said
in
a
telephone
interview
last
week
your
vote
is
your
voice
and
theres
more
power
in
it
than
in
most
of
the
things
we
do
its
a
lost
pleasure
the
feeling
of
that
power
in
recent
years
psychologists
and
neuroscientists
have
tried
to
get
a
handle
on
how
people
make
voting
decisions
they
have
taken
brain
scans
to
see
how
certain
messages
or
images
activate
emotion
centers
they
have
spun
out
theories
of
racial
bias
based
on
peoples
splitsecond
reactions
to
white
and
black
faces
they
have
dressed
up
partisan
political
stereotypes
in
scientific
jargon
describing
conservatives
as
inordinately
fearful
and
craving
order
and
liberals
as
openminded
and
tolerant
none
of
which
has
helped
predict
peoples
behavior
in
elections
any
more
than
a
halfdecent
phone
survey
the
problem
is
not
only
sketchy
science
some
experts
say
its
that
researchers
dont
agree
on
the
answer
to
a
more
fundamental
question
why
do
people
vote
at
all
theres
a
longstanding
literature
looking
at
why
any
rational
person
would
vote
when
the
chances
of
actually
influencing
an
election
are
about
the
same
as
getting
hit
by
lightning
said
john
londregan
a
professor
of
politics
and
international
affairs
at
princeton
in
most
theoretical
models
its
hard
to
get
a
predicted
turnout
above
one
that
is
one
voter
yet
new
models
have
done
better
predicting
elections
with
turnouts
closer
to
the
nations
average
of
about
50
percent
of
eligible
voters
they
have
also
revealed
some
of
the
basic
motives
underlying
both
personal
and
group
decisions
about
when
to
vote
and
why
casting
a
ballot
clearly
provides
a
value
far
higher
than
its
political
impact
the
benefit
may
include
side
payments

say
the
barbecues
and
camaraderie
of
a
campaign
or
the
tiny
possibility
that
a
single
vote
may
be
decisive
but
recent
research
suggests
that
it
has
more
to
do
with
civic
duty
and
the
maintenance
of
moral
selfimage
in
a
series
of
experiments
researchers
from
northwestern
university
and
the
university
of
california
berkeley
have
had
study
participants
play
a
simple
election
game
involving
monetary
rewards
a
group
of
designated
voters
cast
their
vote
for
choice
a
an
equal
distribution
of
money
among
voters
and
nonvoters
in
the
study
or
b
a
payout
to
be
split
only
among
the
designated
voters

a
smaller
group
so
a
higher
amount
it
cost
money
to
vote
and
participants
could
abstain
at
no
cost
the
study
authors
led
by
sean
gailmard
at
berkeley
called
choice
a
ethical
and
choice
b
selfish
they
found
that
ethical
voting
ran
highest
at
about
20
percent
when
individual
votes
were
least
likely
to
affect
the
outcome
selfish
voting
ran
highest
also
about
20
percent
when
individuals
choices
were
most
likely
to
change
the
outcome
this
finding
could
explain
why
people
might
vote
against
a
local
tax
increase
but
for
a
congressional
candidate
who
was
likely
to
raise
their
income
taxes
their
vote
carries
far
less
value
in
a
national
race
than
in
a
local
one
this
study
and
others
also
imply
that
there
is
a
core
of
voters
who
not
only
turn
out
at
the
polls
but
also
cast
their
ballot
for
the
candidate
or
proposal
they
believe
represents
the
larger
good
this
makes
sense
to
those
who
study
the
evolution
of
group
behavior
small
communities
often
have
a
scattering
of
people
who
stand
up
and
do
the
right
thing
their
compensation
is
the
private
knowledge
that
they
are
willing
to
pay
some
cost
to
do
what
they
believe
is
right
even
if
that
price
amounts
to
standing
out
in
the
cold
for
15
minutes
waiting
to
pull
a
lever
it
may
be
a
form
of
identity
construction
for
individuals
gailmard
wrote
in
an
email
message
or
it
could
be
a
duty
to
do
the
right
thing
or
a
social
norm
fleischaker
the
absentee
oklahoma
voter
put
it
this
way
who
are
we
to
ask
others
to
do
things
for
this
country
small
or
very
large
like
fighting
in
a
war
if
we
ourselves
are
not
going
to
take
the
trouble
to
vote
the
military
analogy
is
not
overdrawn
londregan
says
in
a
2006
paper
voting
as
a
credible
threat
he
and
andrea
vindigni
of
princeton
argue
from
historical
and
sociological
evidence
that
at
times
of
deep
division
elections
function
as
an
xray
into
the
strength
of
the
opposition
the
number
of
people
willing
to
bear
a
cost
to
have
their
way
in
the
extreme
election
returns
prompt
factions
on
the
brink
of
civil
war
to
reassess
their
chances
and
negotiate

making
communities
small
and
large
far
more
stable
and
adaptive
we
started
to
see
that
elections
function
as
a
kind
of
sat
score
to
show
what
kind
of
guerrilla
youd
be
londregan
said
theyre
a
way
to
see
how
many
people
would
actually
fight
to
oppose
a
policy

and
how
much
is
just
bravado
dutiful
voters
know
all
this
at
some
level
no
matter
how
they
define
the
larger
good
they
think
more
broadly
about
what
others
of
their
stripe
will
do
spending
more
effort
if
they
feel
their
home
team
will
be
underrepresented
political
scientists
have
found
by
taking
into
account
such
calculations
as
well
as
ethical
voting
the
costs
of
casting
a
ballot
and
other
parameters
timothy
feddersen
and
alvaro
sandroni
of
northwestern
university

gailmards
coauthors
on
the
ethical
voting
research

have
designed
a
model
that
accurately
predicted
turnout
in
several
local
texas
elections
the
model
predicts
that
in
states
where
the
election
is
close
turnout
will
be
high
among
all
groups
feddersen
said
adding
that
in
the
tossup
states
partisans
are
less
likely
to
vote
when
they
are
in
the
majority
and
more
likely
to
vote
when
they
are
in
the
minority
or
expect
to
lose
in
short
expect
the
race
in
states
like
new
york
and
oklahoma
to
be
closer
than
polls
show
not
because
of
hidden
racism
or
inordinate
fear
but
because
many
people
find
it
satisfying
to
stand
up
and
be
counted

even
if
theyre
doing
the
counting
for
themselves
a
federal
court
has
blocked
the
bush
administrations
effort
to
save
money
on
medicare
by
paying
for
only
the
least
expensive
treatments
for
particular
conditions
congress
sets
medicare
payment
rates
and
never
intended
to
give
officials
broad
discretion
to
alter
them
the
court
said
in
an
important
test
case
last
month
the
case
closely
followed
by
medicare
officials
and
consumer
advocates
involved
drugs
used
to
treat
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
judge
henry
h
kennedy
jr
of
us
district
court
here
said
the
policy
of
paying
for
only
the
least
costly
alternative
was
not
permitted
under
the
medicare
law
the
administrations
position
would
give
the
health
and
human
services
secretary
enormous
discretion
to
determine
the
amount
paid
for
every
item
and
service
covered
by
medicare
without
reference
to
the
detailed
formulas
set
by
congress
kennedy
said
this
flies
in
the
face
of
the
detailed
statutory
provisions
he
added
over
the
years
medicare
officials
have
often
tried
to
adopt
regulations
that
allow
them
to
consider
cost
in
deciding
whether
the
program
should
cover
various
goods
and
services
health
care
providers
manufacturers
and
some
patients
advocates
have
resisted
these
efforts
saying
that
coverage
decisions
should
be
made
based
on
clinical
effectiveness
and
not
cost
we
are
disappointed
with
the
ruling
and
continue
to
believe
that
our
policy
is
supported
by
the
statute
peter
l
ashkenaz
a
spokesman
for
the
federal
centers
for
medicare
and
medicaid
services
said
monday
we
are
still
considering
our
options
and
next
steps
federal
health
officials
said
the
decision
would
make
it
more
difficult
to
rein
in
medicare
costs
kennedy
found
that
medicare
and
some
of
its
contractors
had
unlawfully
limited
payments
for
duoneb
an
inhalation
drug
taken
through
a
nebulizer
which
turns
the
medicine
into
a
fine
mist
the
drug
made
by
dey
a
unit
of
mylan
inc
makes
breathing
easier
by
opening
up
the
bronchial
tubes
a
single
dose
provides
a
combination
of
two
commonly
prescribed
bronchodilators
albuterol
and
ipratropium
congress
set
forth
the
touchstone
for
medicare
coverage
in
a
1965
law
that
created
the
program
the
law
generally
prohibits
payment
for
items
and
services
that
are
not
reasonable
and
necessary
for
the
diagnosis
or
treatment
of
illness
or
injury
or
to
improve
the
functioning
of
a
malformed
body
member
if
an
item
is
covered
the
payment
rate
is
specified
in
other
parts
of
the
law
the
bush
administration
argued
that
medicare
officials
had
the
right
to
decide
whether
the
expense
incurred
for
a
given
item
not
just
the
item
itself
was
reasonable
and
necessary
kennedy
said
this
argument
does
not
make
sense
because
congress
went
to
great
lengths
to
establish
payment
rates
similar
disputes
have
come
up
over
other
treatments
another
pharmaceutical
company
sepracor
has
for
years
challenged
the
governments
authority
to
use
the
least
costly
alternative
as
a
basis
for
setting
reimbursement
rates
for
xopenex
prescribed
for
asthma
and
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
in
a
friendofthecourt
brief
sepracor
said
that
congress
had
set
the
payment
rate
at
106
percent
of
the
average
sales
price
congress
consciously
chose
to
entrust
the
amount
of
reimbursement
to
the
market
not
to
a
government
agency
or
its
contractors
the
company
said
in
its
brief
patrick
morrisey
a
lawyer
representing
sepracor
said
if
you
extend
the
agencys
logic
to
its
natural
conclusion
congress
would
never
need
to
pass
any
payment
laws
and
policies
scott
t
williams
vice
president
of
mens
health
network
an
education
and
advocacy
group
said
the
decision
would
be
a
springboard
to
help
ensure
that
prostatecancer
patients

a
wave
of
violence
including
an
assassination
attempt
against
a
deputy
oil
minister
swept
through
baghdad
and
neighboring
diyala
province
on
monday
also
on
monday
parliament
passed
a
bill
that
would
grant
the
countrys
embattled
minorities
fewer
guaranteed
seats
in
upcoming
elections
than
the
united
nations
had
recommended
the
prospects
for
enactment
of
the
bill
which
requires
the
approval
of
iraqs
executive
council
are
unclear
in
september
parliament
passed
a
law
on
provincial
elections
but
in
a
controversial
action
deleted
from
it
an
article
dealing
with
representation
of
iraqs
many
minorities
the
council
composed
of
the
countrys
president
and
two
vice
presidents
signed
that
measure
into
law
early
last
month
but
directed
parliament
to
pass
separate
legislation
on
the
issue
in
the
most
lethal
attack
of
the
day
6
people
were
killed
and
20
wounded
when
two
roadside
bombs
exploded
in
quick
succession
in
front
of
the
headquarters
of
the
ministry
of
interiors
criminal
investigations
unit
in
baghdads
central
karada
district
according
to
an
official
at
the
ministry
who
spoke
anonymously
because
he
was
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
the
deadlier
bomb
was
planted
in
front
of
the
protective
concrete
wall
ringing
the
government
building
the
other
was
about
70
yards
away
two
badly
burned
bodies
lay
on
the
street
shortly
after
the
explosions
i
cannot
believe
what
happened
said
a
bewildered
policeman
at
the
scene
who
said
he
had
worked
for
the
directorate
for
35
years
who
can
plant
a
bomb
in
this
fortified
area
in
the
presence
of
police
patrols
the
assassination
attempt
against
the
deputy
oil
minister
came
about
30
minutes
before
the
karada
blasts
the
official
saheb
salman
qutub
was
wounded
along
with
his
driver
when
a
bomb
planted
in
his
car
exploded
according
to
a
ministry
spokesman
asim
jihad
the
explosion
occurred
as
qutub
was
getting
into
the
car
at
his
home
in
the
northern
baghdad
neighborhood
of
atafiya
to
go
to
work
jihad
said
a
japanese
delegation
visited
the
ministry
monday
to
discuss
investments
in
iraqs
lucrative
oil
and
gas
sectors
in
other
violence
a
huge
car
bomb
exploded
in
a
parking
lot
next
to
the
headquarters
of
the
local
government
in
baqouba
in
diyala
province
killing
at
least
three
people
and
wounding
13
including
eight
police
officers
according
to
security
and
provincial
officials
the
blast
destroyed
22
vehicles
and
badly
damaged
several
nearby
government
buildings
ibrahim
bajlan
who
heads
the
diyala
provincial
council
said
the
attack
was
proof
that
the
situation
in
the
province
remained
fragile
and
that
the
governments
lauded
recent
security
operation
in
diyala
had
only
accomplished
a
fraction
of
its
goals
fourteen
other
people
were
wounded
in
four
other
bombing
attacks
in
baghdad
according
to
the
official
of
the
interior
ministry
in
the
northern
city
of
mosul
a
child
was
killed
and
five
other
people
wounded
in
a
roadside
bombing
aimed
at
a
police
patrol
security
sources
said
the
attacks
came
a
day
after
us
and
iraqi
military
officials
said
that
overall
levels
of
violence
across
the
country
were
at
their
lowest
level
since
may
2004
in
passing
legislation
that
could
stoke
further
tensions
between
iraqs
fractious
ethnic
and
sectarian
groups
parliament
voted
to
guarantee
minorities
significantly
fewer
seats
on
provincial
councils
than
had
been
recommended
by
the
un
assistance
mission
for
iraq
the
bill
would
give
christians
a
single
seat
on
councils
in
baghdad
basra
and
nineveh
instead
of
the
three
seats
in
baghdad
and
three
in
nineveh
as
well
as
one
in
basra
that
were
proposed
by
the
unmission
the
yazidis
a
kurdishspeaking
minority
who
like
christians
have
been
reeling
from
attacks
and
displacement
since
the
start
of
the
war
in
2003
were
given
one
seat
in
nineveh
instead
of
the
three
proposed
two
other
minorities
the
shabaks
and
the
sabeans
were
given
one
seat
apiece
the
new
bill
is
supposed
to
be
a
compromise
following
the
controversy
that
erupted
in
late
september
when
parliament
passed
the
elections
law
but
deleted
an
article
that
had
provided
13
seats
in
six
provinces
for
iraqi
christians
yazidis
and
other
minorities
the
new
bill
grants
only
six
seats
the
un
mission
had
proposed
a
total
of
12
younadim
kanna
one
of
two
christians
in
parliament
described
mondays
vote
as
a
great
insult
there
is
no
desire
to
respect
minorities
as
the
indigenous
people
of
this
country
mr
kanna
said
this
quota
is
simply
a
facesaving
mechanism
by
the
ruling
parties
elections
are
expected
to
be
conducted
in
most
of
the
country

next

alexandra
hubbard
did
not
want

arc
she
wanted
to
be
jane
goodall
but
instead
of
chimpanzees
her
animals
would
turn
out
to
be
killer
whales
in
1984
26
years
old
and
armed
only
with
a
bachelors
degree
and
enthusiasm
for
her
task
she
moved
to
the
broughton
archipelago
in
the
queen
charlotte
strait
of
british
columbia
where
the
whales
or
orcas
were
abundant
she
and
her
husband
robin
morton
a
canadian
filmmaker
lived
on
a
65foot
sailboat
and
followed
the
orcas
in
an
inflatable
boat
with
a
shelter
in
the
back
stocked
with
legos
and
books
for
their
son
jarret
she
came
to
know
the
archipelagos
longlived
orca
clans
and
the
matriarchs
who
led
them
she
knew
she
would
find
them
in
fife
sound
at
the
ebb
tide
or
moving
up
johnson
strait
with
the
incoming
tide
using
a
hydrophone
an
underwater
microphone
she
hung
from
the
boat
she
recorded
their
vocalizations
and
began
to
recognize
what
she
called
the
dialects
of
the
clans
her
husband
drowned
in
1986
when
jarret
was
4
but
morton
stayed
on
supporting
her
work
by
writing
articles
and
books
designing
tshirts
and
working
as
a
deckhand
on
a
fishing
boat
today
she
hardly
uses
her
hydrophone
theres
no
point
she
says
since
my
subject
is
so
rare
now
these
days
when
morton
noses
her
workboat
away
from
her
dock
here
she
is
on
a
crusade
seeking
not
orcas
but
evidence
against
the
salmon
farms
she
believes
drove
most
of
the
killer
whales
away
in
part
by
infecting
the
wild
salmon
the
whales
eat
with
parasites
called
sea
lice
her
work
is
a
challenge
to
the
salmon
farm
industry
and
to
the
canadian
and
british
columbia
officials
who
regulate
it
once
dismissed
as
an
outsider
and
amateur
morton
has
gradually
gained
the
respect
of
fisheries
experts
like
ray
hilborn
a
researcher
at
the
university
of
washington
she
doesnt
come
from
a
science
background
but
she
has
had
a
lot
of
influence
in
highlighting
the
issue
he
said
daniel
pauly
director
of
the
fisheries
center
at
the
university
of
british
columbia
calls
her
a
spunky
hero
that
may
be
because
she
takes
the
issue
personally
the
disappearance
of
the
orcas
in
the
broughton
ruined
my
life
absolutely
morton
said
one
day
recently
as
she
headed
off
to
net
baby
salmon
and
check
them
for
sea
lice
a
lot
of
people
have
lost
stuff
they
set
out
to
do
but
yeah
it
ruined
my
whole
plan
according
to
the
british
columbia
salmon
farmers
association
salmon
farms
produce
450
million
worth
of
atlantic
salmon
a
year
in
british
columbia
at
any
given
time
70
to
80
farm
sites
operate
in
provincial
waters
perhaps
15
or
so
in
the
broughton
a
hardly
inhabited
area
across
queen
charlotte
strait
from
the
north
end
of
vancouver
island
typically
each
installation
has
a
collection
of
net
pens
usually
crossed
by
metal
walkways
floating
in
a
cove
or
bay
individual
sites
typically
contain
500000
to
750000
penned
fish
as
tiny
young
wild
salmon
smolts
pass
by
these
pens
on
their
way
to
sea
they
can
pick
up
so
many
lice
they
die
morton
and
other
researchers
have
reported
farm
operators
like
marine
harvest
a
norwegian
concern
that
is
a
major
presence
in
salmon
farming
here
concede
that
penned
fish
are
vulnerable
to
microbes
and
parasites
but
say
drugs
and
pesticides
minimize
the
problem
virtually
eliminating
the
risk
to
wild
fish
stocks
for
example
kelly
osborne
who
manages
farm
sites
in
the
broughton
for
marine
harvest
said
penned
fish
were
treated
with
an
antilouse
drug
called
slice
as
smolts
began
their
migration
to
the
ocean
the
drug
is
so
effective
he
said
that
perhaps
only
1
in
10
penned
fish
would
have
a
live
louse
government
officials
say
it
would
be
premature
to
blame
the
farms
for
declines
in
salmon
runs
seen
here
recently
because
those
numbers
fluctuate
naturally
but
morton
and
researchers
like
martin
krkosek
of
the
university
of
alberta
and
john
volpe
of
the
university
of
victoria
predict
that
some
local
salmon
runs
will
disappear
unless
the
farms
are
altered
or
removed
and
because
salmon
loom
large
in
the
diets
of
orcas
bears
eagles
and
other
animals
their
disappearance
would
unravel
the
regions
web
of
life
a
lot
of
wild
salmon
populations
have
been
on
the
edge
for
quite
a
long
time
threatened
by
logging
dams
and
plain
old
overfishing
said
ellen
pikitch
a
fisheries
biologist
who
heads
the
institute
for
ocean
conservation
science
at
stony
brook
university
in
new
york
the
sea
lice
problem
could
be
the
nail
in
the
coffin
for
some
of
these
fish
pikitch
also
pointed
out
what
some
scientists
say
is
an
even
bigger
problem
with
salmon
farms
it
takes
more
than
one
pound
of
fish
processed
into
pellets
to
produce
one
pound
of
salmon
even
though
farms
are
working
to
bring
the
ration
down

some
say
they
have
achieved
a
onetoone
ratio

pikitch
said
the
growing
need
to
feed
farmed
salmon
had
greatly
increased
the
demand
for
anchovies
herring
and
other
fish
and
aquaculture
is
indirectly
pulling
the
rug
out
from
under
the
ocean
ecosystem
when
morton
arrived
at
the
broughton
she
was
a
graceful
young
woman
with
dark
hair
that
flowed
halfway
down
her
back
i
thought
she
was
another
crazy
hippie
billy
proctor
locally
acknowledged
as
the
broughtons
master
fisherman
said
in
an
interview
she
still
moves
gracefully
but
her
flowing
hair
is
gray
now
and
she
long
ago
won
proctors
admiration
for
her
devotion
to
the
broughton
and
its
wildlife
when
her
husband
died
proctor
took
morton
on
as
a
deckhand
they
collaborated
on
a
book
heart
of
the
raincoast
touchwood
editions
1998
an
account
of
his
life
and
changing
times
today
when
proctor
and
other
fishermen
find
escaped
atlantic
salmon
in
their
nets
they
often
bring
them
to
her
she
cuts
them
open
and
records
among
other
things
whether
they
have
been
fed
the
chemicals
that
farms
add
to
feed
to
color
their
grayish
flesh
a
more
appealing
pink
then
she
disposes
of
the
bodies
usually
by
dumping
them
in
the
water
for
crabs
and
other
scavengers
to
eat
meanwhile
in
what
she
calls
partnered
science
she
works
regularly
with
experts
from
several
universities
typically
they
design
a
research
plan
and
morton
organizes
the
collection
of
field
samples
and
other
data
to
help
carry
it
out
at
first
morton
reported
her
observations
naively
pauly
recalled
it
was
simply
hey
look
at
this
wild
salmon
are
riddled
with
parasites
her
opponents
attacked
her
as
inadequately
credentialed
he
said
in
the
years
since
papers
morton
has
helped
write
have
appeared
in
major
scientific
journals
like
science
which
in
december
published
a
study
in
which
she
and
her
coauthors
link
fish
farms
to
precipitous
declines
of
pink
salmon
in
the
broughton
scientists
at
the
university
of
alberta
simon
fraser
university
and
the
university
of

are
sending
graduate
students
to
the

coast
research
station
she
established
here
at
echo
bay
a
community
of
a
few
families
that
clings
to
rocky
crags
that
plunge
beachless
straight
down
into
cold
clear
water
there
is
so
little
flat
land
that
many
people
live
in
float
houses

cabins
built
on
rafts
or
floats
of
footthick
logs
lashed
to
the
shore
there
are
no
roads
no
cars
and
no
shops
except
the
few
shelves
of
staples
in
the
post
office
in
simoom
sound
around
a
wooded
promontory
from
mortons
home
where
mail
arrives
once
a
week
morton
acknowledges
that
the
three
ws
widow
whales
wilderness
draw
a
lot
of
attention
to
her
work
she
embraces
it
the
problem
with
this
whole
issue
is
if
nobody
sees
it
nothing
happens
she
said
one
day
recently
as
she
motored
past
one
of
the
farming
operations
and
because
most
of
the
fish
farmed
here
end
up
in
trucks
heading
down
i5
to
california
she
said
it
cant
just
be
the
canadian
public
it
has
to
be
the
american
public
so
just
as
jane
goodall
speaks
for
chimps
morton
said
she
wants
to
tell
the
world
about
the
troubles
afflicting
the
orcas
not
as
a
crusader
but
as
a
woman
cleaning
house
the
research
station
occupies
a
shedlike
building
on
a

the
graduate

live
in
a

untouched

inland
one
is
a
former

that
proctor
lived
in
as
a

and
which
morton
and
her
son
occupied
after
proctor
and
other
neighbors
hauled
it
up
onto
the

now
morton
said
another
is
a
house
she
built
with
eric

whom
she
met
several
years
after
her
husband
died
and
who
is
the
father
of
her
12yearold
daughter
clio
still
another
is
a
house
she
built
herself
she
said
when
it
was
clear
the

would
split
up
the
station
is
supported
in
part
by
sarah
haney
a
retired
nurse
and
environmental
campaigner
from
ontario
whose
philanthropic
resources
come
from
the
game
trivial
pursuit

her
former
husband
was
one
of
its
inventors
and
she
was
an
early
partner
in
the
venture
one
of
her
major
interests
is
whales
haney
said
in
a
telephone
interview
so
she
learned
about
morton
and
her
work
when
the
compound
came
up
for
sale
haney
bought
it
and
paid
a
lot
of
money
for
improvements
including
a
new
dock
and
a
laboratory
building
this
summer
she
deeded
the
whole
place
over
to
morton
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
philanthropic
ventures
i
have
ever
been
involved
with
she
said
when
morton
first
came
to
british
columbia
she
did
not
have
a
traditional
academic
background
she
was
a
prep
school
dropout
milton
academy
in
massachusetts
who
had
worked
in
california
for
john
lilly
an
eccentric
researcher
who
studied
dolphin
communication
by
then
she
had
taken
enough
college
courses
to
earn
a
bachelors
degree
she
said
she
first
encountered
orcas
at
marineland
an
oceanarium
in
la
jolla
calif
and
decided
she
had
to
see
them
in
the
wild
she
had
thoughts
of
returning
to
school
for
a
doctorate
instead
she
said
i
met
robin
and
just
fell
so
crazy
in
love
with
him
that
before
i
really
thought
about
it
i
just
totally
jumped
tracks
in
september
after
decades
off
the
grid
morton
moved
to
a
small
town
on
malcolm
island
in
the
queen
charlotte
strait
where
she
will
stay
until
clio
finishes
high
school
she
will
live
in
a
house
on
the
water
a
fixerupper
she
called
it
and
she
will
visit
the
research
station
by
boat
because
she
wont
have
to
chop
wood
or
perform
other
echo
bay
chores
shell
have
time
for
projects
like
studying
statistics
online
and
she
is
looking
forward
to
conversation
in
a
tiny
community
like
echo
bay
she
said
encountering
new
people
with
something
new
to
say
is
a
real
treat
billy
and
i

susceptible

of

there
is
jacob
an
anglodutch
trader
whose
memories
of
his
own
parentless
years
on
the
streets
stealing
food
and
cadging
gratuities
for
errands
have
left
him
with
a
pulse
of
pity
for
orphans
and
strays
there
is
his
wife
rebekka
who
as
a
girl
of
16
was
sent
abroad
to
america
by
her
father
who
happy
to
have
one
less
mouth
to
feed
readily
accepted
jacobs
offer
of
reimbursement
for
clothing
expenses
and
a
few
supplies
in
exchange
for
a
healthy
chaste
wife
willing
to
travel
abroad
and
there
is
florens
whose
mother
sees
the
kindness
in
jacobs
heart
and
begs
him
to
take
her
young
daughter
as
payment
for
a
debt
owed
by
their
domineering
owner
in
the
hopes
that
the
trader
will
give
her
a
better
life
and
the
possibility
of
a
future
as
a
free
woman
not
a
slave
but
what
is
a
mercy
to
florens
mother
is
experienced
by
the
girl
as
an
act
of
abandonment
and
it
will
leave
her
with
a
hole
in
her
heart
and
an
abiding
need
for
love
and
approval
for
a
time
florens
finds
a
sense
of
belonging
on
jacobs
farm

the
illusion
even
of
family
jacob
is
often
away
from
home
doing
business
and
rebekka
and
lina
the
american
indian
slave
who
helped
jacob
get
the
farm
started
find
the
daily
hardships
of
frontier
life
bringing
them
together
in
an
alliance
of
survival
that
slowly
turns
into
friendship
both
are
wary
of
the
first
waif
jacob
brings
home
a
strange
daft
girl
named
sorrow
who
was
found
halfdrowned
in
a
river
rebekka
regards
sorrow
as
useless
around
the
farm
while
lina
who
has
survived
the
devastation
of
her
own
tribe
by
a
plague
sees
the
stranger
as
bad
luck
in
the
flesh
and
blames
her
for
the
early
deaths
of
rebekkas
children
florens
in
contrast
awakens
a
maternal
instinct
in
lina
and
she
embraces
the
girl
as
if
she
were
longlost
kin
a
frightened
longnecked
child
who
did
not
speak
for
weeks
but
when
she
did
her
light
singsong
voice
was
lovely
to
hear
some
how
some
way
the
child
assuaged
the
tiny
yet
eternal
yearning
for
the
home
lina
once
knew
where
everyone
had
anything
and
no
one
had
everything
years
later
florens
falls
passionately
in
love
with
a
visiting
blacksmith
a
free
black
man
who
has
come
to
work
on
a
fancy
gate
for
jacobs
new
house
and
who
miraculously
cures
sorrow
of
a
deathly
illness
lina
warns
her
of
the
perils
of
giving
away
her
heart

you
are
one
leaf
on
his
tree
she
says

but
florens
insists
she
is
his
tree
when
his
work
is
done
however
the
blacksmith
leaves
without
even
troubling
to
say
goodbye
and
like
so
many
earlier
morrison
characters
florens
learns
the
perils
of
caring
too
much

and
the
legacy
of
loss
and
leaving
bequeathed
to
her
by
her
mother
as
long
as
jacob
is
alive
morrison
writes
it
was
easy
to
veil
the
truth
that
they
were
not
a
family

not
even
a
likeminded
group
but
when
he
suddenly
dies
of
the
pox
and
rebekka
too
falls
gravely
ill
lina
florens
and
sorrow
realize
their
precarious
position
three
unmastered
women
alone
belonging
to
no
one
became
wild
game
for
anyone
female
and
illegal
they
would
be
interlopers
squatters
if
they
stayed
on
after
mistress
died
subject
to
purchase
hire
assault
abduction
exile
their
one
hope
is
to
find
the
blacksmith
and
persuade
him
to
return
to
work
his
magic
on
rebekka
it
is
florens
who
is
sent
on
this
quest
her
passion
for
the
man
both
a
spur
and
a
hazard
to
her
mission
the
main
storyteller
in
this
volume
is
florens
who
abandoned
by
the
blacksmith
feels
herself
an
ice
floe
cut
away
from
the
riverbank
but
her
voice
is
just
one
in
this
choral
tale

a
tale
that
not
only
emerges
as
a
heartbreaking
account
of
lost
innocence
and
fractured
dreams
but
also
stands
with
beloved

and
if

move
forward
on

and

does
their

i
would
want

to
tie
in
people
like

say

brazzale
who
described
himself
as
a
union
man
and
a
democrat
said
that
he
welcomed
the
change
and
that
who
knows
in
20
years
cheyenne
could
even
become
a
kind
of
hightech
wunderkind
like
boulder
a
denver
satellite
known
for
its
fancy

liberals
and
geeks
in
a
hint
of
that
possible
future
the

in

a

research
institute
financed
by

announced
last

that
its

scheduled

the

will
foster

between
researchers
from
colorado
and
wyoming
who
will
now
have
reason
to
meet
in
cheyenne
still
ron

is
among
those
who

old
political
boundaries
will

as
things
change
colorado
is

will
remain
republican

still
held

on

western
culture
and
would
not
surrender
the
claim
to
denver
regardless
of
dollar
signs
denver
has
never
really
been
the
west
he
said
repeating
a
commonly
heard
insult
around

that
in
rowdier
days
might
have
sparked
a
fistfight
at
the
cheyenne
area
convention
and
visitors
bureau
the
groups
president
and
chief
executive
darren
rudloff
said
he
thought
a
greater
linkage
with
denver
was
inevitable
and
mostly
positive
the
three
conjoined
metropolitan
areas
of
northeastern
colorado

denveraurora
boulder
and
fort
collinsloveland

now
press
right
up
to
the
wyoming
border
taken
together
they
are
among
the
fastestgrowing
areas
in
the
nation
over
the
last
two
decades
with
a
population
increase
of
about
44
percent
to
just
under
3
million
people
according
to
the
most
recent
census
bureau
estimates
i
dont
think
theres
any
business
resistance
rudloff
said
but
there
would
be
i
think
in
some
quarters
resistance
to
losing
too
much
of
the
cheyenneness

there
would
be
some
push
back
on
the
other
hand
rudloff
added
many
wyoming
residents
have
already
written
off
cheyenne
believing
that
the
city
has
fallen
off
the
map
already
and
into
colorado
were
not
colorado
and
were
not
totally
wyoming
according
to
some
people
he
said
so
were
kind
of
stuck
in
the
middle
but
if
geography
is
destiny
there
is
perhaps
a
historical
twist
as
well
political
and
business
leaders
here
say
the
growth
of
metropolitan
denvers
population
north
toward
wyoming
which
has
no
income
tax
sharpens
the
business
allure
of
cheyenne
as
a
commuting
destination
for
more
and
more
coloradans
making
the
city
a
legitimate
contender
with
denver
for
the
first
time
in
generations
and
stirring
those
old
dreams
of
greatness
laura

said
too
many
locals
fell
in
love
with
the
party
i
listen
to
a
radio
station
that
comes
from
denver
she
said
i
had
to
turn
it
off
i
couldnt
stand
it
any
more
i
voted
a
week
ago
in
order
to
write
this
column
it
is
intended
to
be
a
useful
guide
i
assume
you
will
clip
this
article
out
of
the
newspaper
take
it
with
you
into
the
voting
booth

and
do
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
i
did
for
the
senate
yes
i
voted
for
jeff
beatty
if
not
me
then
who
i
saw
him
on
emily
rooneys
tv
show
a
few
weeks
ago
he
claimed
to
have
commissioned
a
poll
showing
that
voters
preferred
him
to
his
opponent
john
kerry
if
only
anyone
knew
who
jeff
beatty
was
yes
its
astonishing
how
the
betterknown
people
just
keep
getting
elected
i
heard
a
snippet
of
a
kerrybeatty
debate
the
one
where
senator
kerry
claimed
not
to
own
any
stock
i
wouldnt
own
any
stock
either
if
i
was
married
to
fort
knox
for
the
house
i
voted
for
bailout
barney
frank
mainly
because
i
hadnt
taken
the
time
to
learn
who
opposed
him
if
i
had
known
that
the
gops
earl
sholley
was
a
fivetime
finisher
of
the
boston
marathon
and
a
member
of
the
appalachian
mountain
club
i
might
have
supported
him
my
bad
i
do
like
barney
though
each
year
he
becomes
more
irascible
and
difficult
to
deal
with
he
reminds
me
of
someone
i
know
question
1
i
let
you
down
im
precisely
the
kind
of
knownothing
crank
who
would
vote
to
eliminate
the
income
tax
it
was
tempting
especially
considering
who
was
arrayed
against
it
every
featherbedding
ethically
compromised
labor
union
in
the
state
hand
in
hand
with
the
selfappointed
good
government
types
voting
yes
seemed
like
a
brief
pleasurable
but
ultimately
pointless
gesture
like
yelling
at
manny
ramirez
on
the
tv
set
i
have
lots
of
enemies
but
the
state
of
massachusetts
isnt
one
of
them
i
voted
no
question
2
sure
croesuslevel
currency
manipulator
and
question
two
backer
george
soros
ill
give
you
my
vote
not
bloody
likely
doper
politics
dont
fascinate
me
but
ill
vote
against
soros
any
time
i
voted
no
question
3
i
voted
no
again
isnt
the
idea
of
banning
dog
racing
just
classist
pap
why
not
ban
thoroughbred
horse
racing
with
its
creepy
lysenkoist
breeding
ideologies
and
its
pitiless
jettisoning
of
beautiful
horses
past
their
primes
oh
thats
right
because
posh
people
approve
of
horse
racing
and
because
institutions
that
matter
such
as
the
state
of
new
york
otb
or
abc
and
espn
the
breeders
cup
make
serious
money
off
horse
racing
no
one
makes
serious
money
off
the
dogs
not
even
the
track
owners
if
their
baying
is
to
be
believed
dont
push
your
peta
politics
on
me
the
presidency
some
background
i
hate
voting
for
national
offices
here
because
massachusetts
is
a
oneparty
state
i
would
happily
go
into
grade
schools
and
urge
children
not
to
vote
until
pulling
the
lever
here
actually
means
something
somehow
i
dont
think
the
league
of
women
voters
is
going
to
take
me
up
on
this
offer
eight
years
ago
i
voted
for
ralph
nader
and
am
proud
that
i
did
four
years
ago
i
sold
my
vote
to
my
then
17yearold
son
who
wished
he
had
been
able
to
vote
for
kerry
i
voted
for
kerry
on
his
behalf
and
he
agreed
to
walk
the
dog
maybe
twice
now
hes
21
and
i
am
walking
the
dog
all
alone
i
would
have
voted
for
john
mccain
for
president
in
2000
but
i
didnt
get
the
chance
but
not
now
leftist
claptrap
notwithstanding
political
parties
have
appreciable
differences
forget
me
im
doing
fine
but
is
the
country
better
off
than
it
was
eight
years
ago
i
dont
think
so
i
voted
with
chris
buckley
and
colin
powell
for
obama
i
dont
believe
i
have
ever
voted
for
the
winner
of
a
presidential
election
so
forewarned
is
forearmed
the
winner
as
promised
i
have
chosen
the
winner
of
the
sarah
palindrome
contest
a

is
a

that
makes

out
as

followed

hurricane

for

yeah
hes
a
rock
star
at
least
five
times
during
the
primary
campaign
obama
found
himself
calling
for
the
emts
because
swooning
fans
had
fainted
in
the
audience
the
man
is
84
now
and
in
impressive
condition
for
his
years
still
he
resembles
a
gnomish
shrunken
version
of
his
younger
self

which
is
to
say
a
vital
if
a
bit
bland
mid20thcentury
american
male
with
dark
suit
clark
kent
glasses
and
an
air
of
having
important
business
to
attend
to
senator
ted
stevens
of
alaska
who
was
convicted
last
week
on
seven
counts
of
corruption
could
be
the
protagonist
of
an
arthur
miller
tragedy
a
formerly
robust
confident
american
winner
laid
low
by
secret
compromises
and
longrepressed
deceits
and
tuesday
could
be
his
denouement
having
refused
to
drop
out
of
his
race
for
reelection

despite
requests
from
fellow
republicans
john
mccain
and
his
homestate
governor
sarah
palin

stevens
could
well
end
his
career
in
electoral
defeat
to
go
along
with
his
criminal
convictions
its
a
mighty
fall
for
a
man
known
as
alaskas
patriarch
a
former
world
war
ii
pilot
who
went
on
to
play
a
role
in
his
states
battle
to
join
the
union
and
then
represented
it
in
the
senate
for
40
years
in
washington
he
will
be
remembered
mostly
as
a
porkbarrel
politician
delivering
billions
of
dollars
in
earmarks
to
his
constituents
while
stinting
a
bit
on
the
larger
national
issues
of
the
day
but
in
his
home
state
the
man
was
a
giant
and
his
disgrace
commands
a
measure
of
sympathy
the
elderly
senator
sat
ramrod
straight
in
the
washington
courtroom
as
the
jury
delivered
its
verdict
news
reports
say
he
tried
to
knit
his
fingers
in
a
gesture
of
calmness
but
had
to
give
up
because
one
of
his
hands
was
shaking
so
badly
despite
the
convictions
some
of
his
loyal
constituents

who
may
yet
return
him
to
the
senate

find
the
charges
against
him
to
be
insubstantial
there
was
little
dispute
that
stevens
received
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
of
renovations
to
his
alaskan
cabin
paid
for
by
bill
allen
ceo
of
a
nowdefunct
oilservices
company
called
veco
which
had
extensive
business
on
alaskas
north
slope
stevens
failed
to
mention
the
home
renovations
and
other
gifts
from
allen

including
a
gas
grill
and
a
sled
dog

on
senate
ethics
forms
for
seven
consecutive
years
but
he
contended
that
he
was
unaware
of
some
of
the
gifts
and
thought
he
had
paid
for
others
therefore
he
believed
the
forms
were
accurate
when
he
signed
them
and
his
wife
catherine
asserted
that
she
alone
had
overseen
the
renovations
workers
however
testified
that
stevens
was
present
for
some
of
the
work
plus
the
stevenses
didnt
even
have
contracts
with
some
of
the
renovators

allen
arranged
everything
lastly
stevenss
defenders
have
noted
that
he
and
allen
were
friends
suggesting
that
the
gifts
were
more
tokens
of
affection
than
bribery
and
its
clear
that
stevens
like
many
politicians
before
him
finds
it
laughable
that
prosecutors
would
feel
such
gifts
could
corrupt
his
integrity
he
would
behave
the
same
way
in
his
official
capacity
whether
allen
gave
him
a
6000
megagrill
or
a
puppy
but
his
case

starting
with
the
longstanding
allegiance
between
a
politician
and
a
businessman
morphing
into
a
friendship
leading
to
pampering
and
gifts

is
practically
a
prototype
of
official
washington
corruption
the
purpose
of
ethics
laws
is
not
to
guard
against
the
unjust
enrichment
of
senators
so
much
as
to
protect
the
public
coffers
from
being
used
to
service
the
kinds
of
friendships
that
existed
between
stevens
and
allen
the
sad
reality
is
that
such
relative
trifles
as
gas
grills
hot
tubs
and
free
rides
on
corporate
jets
can
create
a
backscratch
relationship
that
leads
to
the
giveaway
of
hundreds
of
times
their
value
in
public
largesse
the
one
sacrifice
made
by
career
politicians
like
stevens
is
to
live
with
a
salary
of
169000
per
year
its
not
so
tough
but
for
men
and
women
who
control
billions
of
dollars
it
is
often
galling
to
see
lesspowerful
people
enjoying
more
luxurious
lives
and
when
those
businesspeople
are
eager
to
cultivate
relationships
its
easy
for
politicians

particularly
those
without
rich
spouses
or
family
fortunes
to
fall
back
on

to
start
accepting
a
favor
here
and
there
whether
those
little
favors
lead
in
return
to
bigger
ones
in
the
form
of
government
contracts
can
be
difficult
to
prove
in
any
specific
instance
but
the
idea
that
such
tacit
exchanges
happen
fairly
frequently
and
often
under
the
radar
is
ridiculously
easy
to
comprehend
so
the
senate
wisely
requires
disclosures
of
the
type
that
stevens
failed
to
make
it
seems
like
a
long
fall
from
being
mr
alaska
to
mr
pork
barrel
to
mr
felon

it
may
not
be

her

the
way

why
waste
a

hundred
bucks
on
a

when
the
economy
is
down
and
millions
of
americans
are
struggling
to

ask
mclaughlin

shell
tell
you
flatout
hair
is
nonnegotiable
you
just

it
like

mclaughlin

hair
is
a
top
spending
priority
in
any
economy

it
is
expensive
at

in

a

adds
up
according
to

conducted
by

the

mclaughlin
said
anyone
who
is
skimping
on

in
my
humble
opinion
has

wrong
most

agree
at

according
to
debi

an
hourbyhour
checklist
of
what
states
to
watch
on
election
night
and
how
their
voting
patterns
may
influence
the
outcome
of
the
election

first
polls
close
at
7
pm
look
to
virginia
if
obama
takes
the
state
a
republican
stronghold
for
44
years
it
may
indicate
north
carolina
florida
and
others
are
going
his
way
as
well
if
mccain
is
holding
on
to
virginia
it
may
suggest
two
things
1
the
political
polls
have
been
wrong
2
the
electoral
map
may
not
change
or
change
as
much
as
predicted

730
pm
voting
in
ohio
north
carolina
and
west
virginia
ends
all
three
of
these
states
were
won
by
president
bush
four
years
ago
ohio
with
its
20
electoral
votes
is
the
big
kahuna
at
this
point
and
pundits
are
now
examining
and
pontificating
about
exit
polls
remember
in
2004
exit
polls
showed
democrat
john
kerry
in
the
lead
digest
them
with
caution

830
pm
the
polls
have
closed
in
17
more
states
and
275
electoral
votes
are
now
on
the
table
mccain
probably
needs
to
hold
on
to
two
of
three
states

ohio
pennsylvania
and
florida

in
order
to
win
ohio
polls
came
in
an
hour
earlier
so
look
to
the
other
two
states
now
to
see
where
they
are
leaning
if
mccain
wins
two
or
all
three
and
in
that
instance
obama
has
picked
up
another
state
such
as
virginia
all
eyes
turn
to
the
west
also
watch
missouri
its
a
swing
state
and
may
give
you
a
preview
for
results
from
upcoming
states
if
the
networks
cable
news
and
papers
online
try
to
call
the
race
at
this
point
remember
al
gore
wins
florida
and
dewey
defeats
truman

9

10
pm
with
a
total
of
451
electoral
votes
now
up
for
grabs
this
is
likely
the
makeorbreak
hour
and
the
rocky
mountain
west
is
front
and
center
if
obama
so
far
has
only
picked
up
states
john
kerry
won
four
years
ago
a
sweep
of
colorado
new
mexico
and
nevada
would
be
the
tipping
point
there
is
no
need
to
wait
for
california
washington
and
oregon
whose
polls
close
at
11
pm
because
they
historically
go
democratic
if
mccain
has
followed
in
bushs
footsteps
he
just
needs
one
of
those
three
states
to
win
if
hes
lost
a
state
like
iowa
then
he
would
need
two
of
them
if
mccain
has
won
the
interior
south
and
most
of
the
rust
belt
and
obama
has
picked
up
iowa
and
a
southern
state
like
virginia
the
battle
heads
straight
to
colorado
and
nevada
assuming
new
mexico
goes
for
obama
the
14
electoral
votes
would
put
either
candidate
into
the
white
house

11
pm
idaho
north
dakota
oregon
california
hawaii
and
washington
close
their
polls
but
those
states
are
not
exactly
cliffhangers

1
am
you
should
be
in
bed
or
out
either
celebrating
the
victor
or
complaining
that
the
country
is
going
down
the
tubes
but
if
youre
really
interested
alaska
now
closes
its
polls
now
things
should
be
over
but
remember
florida
in
2000
and
ohio
in
2004
i
was
going
to
say
that
house
has
finally
lost
its
luster
why
for
one
thing
overpopulation
heres
a
drama
series
now
in
its
fifth
season
with
too
many
regular
characters
who
have
nothing
to
do
between
dr
houses
old
staff
his
new
staff
his
private
detective
doctors
wilson
and
cuddy
and
the
patientsoftheweek
the
fox
show
has
become
something
of
a
traffic
jam
when
the
house
writers
finally
devote
an
episode
to
the
onceprominent
cameronchase
romance
next
tuesday
it
will
feel
like
nostalgia
night
i
was
also
going
to
say
that
the
house
storylines
have
grown
increasingly
preposterous
over
the
years

and
they
were
cuckoo
to
start
with
sometimes
the
medical
mysteries
and
the
dramas
about
the
doctors
personal
lives
are
so
overthetop
i
have
to
go
into
a
kind
of
denial
to
get
through
the
hour
i
have
to
work
to
suspend
my
wild
disbelief
while
im
watching
the
insanity
unfold

doctors
breaking
into
patients
homes
house
having
his
pi
go
through
wilsons
garbage
thirteen
getting
fired
but
not
leaving
but
then
later
on
or
during
the
commercials
i
shake
my
head
and
laugh
at
the
lunacy
ok
cuddy
just
drugged
house
so
that
wilson
could
kidnap
him
and
drive
him
to
his
fathers
funeral
got
it
and
yet
i
would
much
rather
say
something
completely
different
here
against
all
odds
and
against
all
the
evidence
of
sloppy
storytelling
and
excessive
implausibility
house
remains
one
of
network
tvs
most
dynamic
hours
obviously
hugh
laurie
is
outrageously
good
he
has
created
an
awful
brilliant
condescending
needy
childlike
curmudgeonly
character
with
nary
a
wrong
note
over
five
years
his
house
already
deserves
a
spot
in
the
tv
character
hall
of
fame
near
archie
bunker
and
hawkeye
pierce
but
i
do
find
that
despite
the
occasional
bum
episode
the
drama
that
is
built
around
laurie
is
still
good
too
weird
but
good
house
cant
be
approached
and
judged
as
a
typical
medical
procedural
even
while
it
has
that
formulaic
quality
the
show
needs
to
be
viewed
as
a
comic
psychodrama
in
which
all
the
medical
cases
reflect
aspects
of
the
doctors
and
all
the
doctors
reflect
aspects
of
house
and
house
reflects
the
naked
id
its
a
crazy
house
of
mirrors
the
crowded
cast
the
overheated
action
and
all
the
absurd
twists
and
turns
are
the
shows
unique
stylization
house
may
be
mainstream
tvs
boldestever
psychological
farce
yes
i
have
sometimes
joined
in
the
chorus
of
fans
who
feel
that
house
is
over
but
right
here
right
now
im
feeling
more
optimistic
with
olivia
wildes
thirteen
getting
more
compelling
and
house
and
cuddy
getting
romantic
and
bold
direction
that
can
turn
a
primetime
hour
into
a
dreamlike
fantasia
the
show
still
deserves
a
chance

washington

pennsylvania
republicans
and
an
independent
group
called
the
national
republican
trust
have
blitzed
the
television
airwaves
in
recent
days
with
ads
that
link
barack
obama
with
his
controversial
former
pastor
the
reverend
jeremiah
a
wright
jr
in
a
lastminute
effort
to
turn
voters
against
the
democratic
presidential
nominee
both
ads
show
wright
making
inflammatory
statements
such
as
not
god
bless
america
god
damn
america
and
calling
the
country
the
us
of
kkka
obama
was
once
close
to
wright
considering
him
a
spiritual
mentor
and
the
man
who
brought
him
to
embrace
christianity
but
obama
broke
off
the
relationship
in
april
after
wright
continued
making
controversial
statements
obama
condemned
wrights
words
as
appalling
an
obama
spokesman
said
the
campaign
would
not
issue
a
response
to
the
ads
john
mccain
the
republican
presidential
nominee
rejected
suggestions
by
some
aides
and
even
his
running
mate
sarah
palin
to
make
an
issue
out
of
wright
mccain
reportedly
feared
such
an
attack
would
be
perceived
to
have
racial
overtones
mccain
spokesman
ben
porritt
said
monday
that
the
arizona
senator
has
been
clear
that
our
campaign
will
not
use
reverend
wright
in
advertising
our
campaign
will
win
on
the
issues
but
porritt
said
mccain
would
not
try
to
stop
the
pennsylvania
gop
and
the
national
republican
trust
political
action
committee
from
airing
the
wright
ads
saying
mccain
is
not
going
to
be
the
traffic
cop
for
every
independent
organization
state
party
or
statelevel
candidate
that
chooses
to
use
these
in
advertising
the
national
republican
trust
has
made
enormous
advertising
buys
to
put
the
ad
on
several
national
television
networks
in
the
final
days
of
the
campaign
the
group
spent
12
million
on
thursday
and
25
million
more
on
friday
its
ad
which
was
running
frequently
on
cnn
monday
questions
obamas
judgment
and
asserts
that
he
never
complained
about
wrights
statements
for
20
years

until
he
started
running
for
president
barack
obama
too
radical
too
risky
the
announcer
concludes
the
groups
leader
scott
wheeler
said
monday
that
his
group
is
running
the
ad
about
wright
because
we
thought
we
would
look
at
what
would
affect
most
people
i
think
most
people
had
no
idea
how
close
wright
and
obama
were
wheeler
said
he
knew
mccain
was
going
to
shy
away
from
it
but
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
people
to
know
wheeler
who
said
he
has
had
no
coordination
with
the
mccain
campaign
or
the
republican
party
said
in
a
telephone
interview
that
he
is
a
former
journalist
who
had
written
articles
critical
of
former
president
clinton
the
groups
website
solicits
donations
with
a
plea
that
says
one
of
the
most
radical
political
figures
ever
to
be
nominated
by
a
major
party
is
just
minutes
away
from
becoming
president
of
the
united
states
the
group
expects
to
raise
85
million
this
year
and
spend
about
7
million
on
advertisements
including
the
commercial
about
wright
the
ad
by
the
pennsylvania
gop
is
running
in
a
state
that
is
widely
considered
one
of
the
most
important
battlegrounds
robert
gleason
jr
the
chairman
of
the
state
party
said
it
believed
the
wright
issue
has
not
received
enough
attention
since
it
was
widely
publicized
in
advance
of
the
states
april
primary
that
obama
lost
when
pennsylvanians
vote
for
a
president
they
should
have
a
full
picture
of
a
candidates
character
including
the
people
they
chose
to
intimately
align
themselves
with
for
many
years
gleason
said
in
a
statement
the
pennsylvania
gop
did
not
return
a
call
seeking
further
comment
in
a
presidential
campaign
season
that
had
70
million
viewers
turn
up
for
a
vice
presidential
debate
and
more
than
30
million
willingly
sit
through
an
infomercial

in

having
been
handed
vast
authority
and
almost
no
restrictions
in
the
bailout
law
that
congress
passed
a
month
ago
a
committee
of
five
littleknown
government
officials
aided
by
a
barebones
staff
of
40
is
picking
winners
and
losers
among

what
you
do
said
david
g
nason
the
assistant
treasury
secretary
for
financial
institutions
who
designed
the
program
and
sits
on
the
investment
committee
we
dont
have
time
to
complain
we
need
to
manage
our
time
so
we
can
make
progress
other
officials
said
it
was
premature
to
condemn
the
program
given
that
the
first
capital
injections
were
made
only
last
week
the
treasurys
overriding
goal
they
said
is
to
stabilize
the
nations
financial
system
after
its
worst
crisis
since
the
1930s
among
the
problems
critics
say
is
that
despite
earlier
promises
of
transparency
the
process
is
shrouded
in
secrecy
its
precise
goals
opaque
treasury
officials
have
refused
to
disclose
their
criteria
for
deciding
which
banks
are
healthy
enough
to
get
money

and
which
are
too
sick
and
officials
have
yet
to
say
they
even
have
a
broader
strategy
though
banking
executives
are
convinced
the
government
wants
to
encourage
acquisitions
of
sick
banks
by
healthy
ones
industry
sources
said
that
banks
after
filing
a
twopage
application
are
assigned
a
ranking
from
1
to
5

with
1
or
2
essentially
guaranteeing
that
they
are
eligible
and
5
insuring
they
are
not

by
their
regulator
the
five
officials
then
make
what
can
be
a
lifeordeath
decision
with
a
thumbsdown
generally
interpreted
to
mean
that
a
bank
was
not
healthy
enough
to
survive
on
its
own
the
work
is
complex
farreaching
and
telescoped
into
an
impossibly
tight
timetable
and
it
is
being
done
against
the
backdrop
of
a
change
of
power
in
washington
which
will
throw
many
of
these
people
out
of
their
jobs
on
inauguration
day
there
is
a
real
urgency
to
deploy
this
money
quickly
and
effectively
said
james
h
lambright
who
took
a
leave
three
weeks
ago
as
the
president
of
the
exportimport
bank
of
the
united
states
to
become
the
interim
chief
investment
officer
of
the
rescue
effort
a
trim
selfconfident
former
investment
banker
lambright
38
is
the
chairman
of
a
committee
of
relatively
young
officials

all
are
in
their
30s
or
40s

with
backgrounds
in
law
banking
or
regulation
none
of
them
could
have
expected
this
kind
of
responsibility
lambright
himself
was
a
lastminute
substitute
after
a
previous
appointee
was
kept
in
his
old
job
on
friday
evening
lambright
was
lugging
a
sixinchthick
pile
of
folders

plus
a
pair
of
blackberrys
and
a
cellphone

as
he
prepared
for
a
sunday
afternoon
meeting
of
the
committee
to
select
the
next
banks
to
receive
capital
infusions
with
more
than
80
billion
left
to
spend
and
hundreds
of
banks
in
line
for
it
the
days
nights
and
weekends
of
the
overworked
sleepdeprived
treasury
staff
members
are
a
blur
of
meetings
and
conference
calls
and
constant
pressure
this
is
a
fourring
circus
said
tim
ryan
a
former
director
of
the
office
of
thrift
supervision
who
helped
run
the
savings
and
loan
cleanup
in
the
1980s
and
1990s
already
critics
from
capitol
hill
to
wall
street
are
lashing
out
at
the
program
saying
the
banks
are
misusing
the
capital
infusions
by
hoarding
the
money
rather
than
lending
it
as
the
treasury
secretary
henry
m
paulson
jr
urged
in
order
to
unclog
the
credit
markets
the
government
the
critics
say
is
wrongly
steering
funds
to
banks
to
take
over
weaker
rivals
the
rescue
program
prodded
one
such
merger
last
week
when
treasury
agreed
to
inject
77
billion
into
pnc
financial
services
and
rejected
an
application
for
cash
from
national
city
corp
an
ailing
bank
in
cleveland
the
two
announced
a
merger
the
same
day
that
pnc
was
approved
where
we
are
headed
is
credit
allocation
by
the
federal
government
said
william
poole
a
former
president
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
st
louis
it
really
reminds
me
of
the
morass
we
got
into
with
wageprice
controls
in
the
1970s
critics
also
say
that
by
not
barring
banks
from
paying
dividends
or
hefty
bonuses
the
treasury
is
leading
taxpayers
to
think
their
money
is
being
spent
frivolously
all
this
comes
after
paulson
abruptly
shifted
the
focus
of
the
program
to
injecting
capital
rather
than
buying
distressed
mortgagerelated
assets
from
the
banks
this
meant
that
congress
had
never
debated
the
details
of
how
the
government
ought
to
carry
out
a
recapitalization
the
absence
of
that
debate
comes
with
a
price
treasury
officials
have
been
pressured
by
industry
lobbyists
to
stretch
the
program
to
include
insurance
companies
transit
agencies
and
even
automakers
indeed
the
helterskelter
nature
of
the
program
is
drawing
so
much
criticism
that
even
some
of
the
bailout
bills
biggest
proponents
on
capitol
hill
are
complaining
that
its
legitimacy
is
being
thrown
into
question
what
the
treasury
doesnt
understand
is
the
anger
in
the
country
about
this
said
rep
barney
frank
dmass
the
chairman
of
the
house
financial
services
committee
frank
who
has
scheduled
oversight
hearings
later
in
november
warned
that
he
might
try
to
block
the
treasury
from
getting
the
second
350
billion
approved
by
congress
inside
the
treasury

where
officials
shuttle
between
each
others
offices
on
the
buildings
southwest
corner
facing
the
white
house
and
the
washington
monument

the
view
not
surprisingly
is
different
they
say
the
critics
have
not
offered
solutions
about
how
to
compel
banks
to
lend
money
the
treasury
has
to
walk
a
fine
line
officials
add
since
using
brute
force
could
lead
to
the
banks
making
more
bad
loans
which
is
how
they
got
into
this
mess
treasury
officials
acknowledge
their
actions
might
speed
a
shakeout
in
the
industry
even
if
that
is
not
the
main
motivation
the
primary
goal
is
not
consolidation
the
primary
goal
is
to
strengthen
the
system
said
michele
a
davis
the
chief
spokeswoman
if
consolidation
strengthens
the
system
its
a
positive
bank
executives
say
that
increased
lending
depends
on
attracting
more
capital
from
private
investors
to
do
that
it
may
be
essential
for
a
bank
to
strengthen
its
market
position
by
making
acquisitions
suspending
dividends
could
send
investors
running
for
the
exits
besides
they
add
the
bailout
law
only
allows
the
government
to
stop
banks
from
increasing
dividends
not
banning
them
outright
the
committee

which
also
includes
neel
kashkari
interim
head
of
the
rescue
program
and
two
other
assistant
secretaries
anthony
ryan
and
phillip
l
swagel

acts
on
a
recommendation
from
the
primary
regulator
of
the
financial
institution
that
could
be
the
federal
reserve
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corp
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
or
the
office
of
thrift
supervision
what
happens
next
when
the
application
and
recommendation
go
to
the
treasury
is
largely
a
mystery
the
criteria
by
which
the
treasury
decides
which
banks
get
money
and
which
do
not
are
secret
nason
said
the
process
had
to
be
confidential
so
that
rejected
banks
did
not
suffer
damage
in
the
markets
even
to
disclose
the
selection
criteria
could
quickly
destabilize
banks
perceived
to
have
the
wrong
profile
he
said
the
committee
members
study
financial
statements
and
sometimes
kick
back
applications
to
the
regulators
for
more
information
they
also
analyze
the
market
in
which
a
bank
operates
looking
for
the
mix
of
strong
and
weak
banks
as
the
number
of
applications
increases
lambright
said
he
was
recruiting
a
team
of
banking
analysts
to
help
with
the
process
when
we
move
from
a
dozen
banks
to
hundreds
of
banks
well
need
a
system
lambright
said
he
said
his
work
at
the
exportimport
bank
where
he
selected
american
exporters
to
receive
trade
financing
was
good
preparation
for
this
job
even
if
he
will
hand
out
more
money
in
a
few
weeks
at
the
treasury
than
his
banks
entire
60
billion
credit
portfolio
though
treasury
officials
are
loath
to
require
banks
to
lend
they
do
seem
to
be
jawboning
they
must
meet
their
responsibility
to
lend
and
support
the
american
people
and
the
us
economy
ryan
told
a
securities
industry
conference
last
week
frank
said
they
should
do
more
by
requiring
banks
to
show
a
dollarfordollar
relationship
between
the
government
funds
and
increased
lending
if
they
lend
out
all
the
money
they
got
from
the
government
he
said
they
can
do
whatever
they
want
with
the
rest
if
they
dont
feel
this
is
going
to
encourage
lending
then
dont
take
the
money
it
is
the
regulators
more
than
the
treasury
department
who
are
doing
the
coaxing
by
suggesting
for
example
that
a
desired
merger
by
a
bank
would
be
more
likely
to
win
approval
if
a
bank
participated
in
the
capital
injection
program
industry
executives
said
the
treasurys
approach
has
its
defenders
among
them
a
former
senior
treasury
official
edwin
m
truman
who
said
he
believed
the
people
running
the
bailout
were
technocrats
trying
to
shore
up
the
system
not
ideologues
donald
v
hammond
a
longtime
treasury
official
who
is
the
interim
chief
compliance
officer
of
the
program
said
that
in
any
event
congress
had
put
in
place
layers
of
oversight
hammond
began
his
government
career
working
on
the
bailout
of
the
chrysler
corp
this
is
more
intense
he
said
five
people
who
were
found
shot
to
death
in
a
homeless
encampment
near
a
highway
overpass
had
apparently
been
taken
by
surprise
long
beach
police
commander
laura
farinelli
said
monday
maybe
they
were
sleeping
when
someone
came
upon
them
she
said
theres
a
lot
of
freeway
traffic
noise
there
and
it
would
have
been
hard
to
hear
someone
approaching
or
even
gunshots
los

county
coroners
have
released
two
of
the
victims
names
lorenzo
perez
villicana
46
and
vanessa
malaepule
35
both
long
beach
residents
the
other
victims
were
two
other
men
and
one
woman
all
five
were
found
clustered
in
the
bushes
sheltered
under
a
tarp
authorities
were
tipped
off
by
an
anonymous
caller
from
a
pay
phone
at
830
am
sunday
morning
the
caller
offered
only
vague
information
about
several
dead
people
near
sante
fe
avenue
and
wardlow
road
near
the
405
freeway
said
farinelli
farinelli
said
that
none
of
the
five
people
were
related
but
speculated
that
the
encampment
had
been
occupied
for
a
substantial
period
because
of
personal
items
found
there
investigators
were
searching
other
homeless
encampments
and
shelters
throughout
the
area
for
information
about
the
victims
and
possible
suspects
no
arrests
have
been
made
farinelli
said
that
such
multiple
killings
were
extremely
rare
in
long
beach
but
andy
bales
of
the
los
angeles
union
rescue
mission
said
violence
against
homeless
people
and
between
homeless
people
is
not
new
he
cited
the
case
of
john
robert
mcgraham
once
a
bellman
at
the
now
closed
ambassador
hotel
who
was
doused
with
gasoline
and
burned
alive
in
los
angeles
three
weeks
ago
no
arrests
have
been
made
in
that
case
either
i
often
have
policemen
bringing
me
pictures
of
homeless
people
who
have
been
beaten
to
death
and
asking
me
information
about
them
he
said
but
whoever
did
this
sounds
like
they
had
a
car
and
they
took
off
from
the
scene
it
appears
the
people
who
did
this
were
not
homeless
bales
was
referring
to
a
witness
account
published
in
the
los
angeles
times
which
quoted
a
resident
in
a
nearby
apartment
complex
who
heard
a
man
shouting
at
someone
to
get
into
a
car
around
the
time
of
the
killings
farinelli
would
not
confirm
on
that
account
according
to
the
national
coalition
for
the
homeless
violence
against
homeless
people
increased
between
1999
and
2006
even
as
overall
violence
decreased
nationally
the
organization
reported
142
attacks
against
homeless
people
in
2006
compared
with
about
60
in
1999
most
of
the
attackers
were
25
years
old
and
younger
and
about
40
percent
were
juveniles
according
to
the
organization
joel
john
roberts
of
people
assisting
the
homeless
a
los
angeles
advocacy
organization
for
homeless
people
said
the
killings
were
a
reminder
of
the
vulnerability
of
the
homeless
he
said
that
providing
homeless
people
more
police
protection
was
not
as
effective
as
getting
southern
californias
tens
of
thousands
of
homeless
people
off
of
the
streets
and
into
housing
few
places

a
half

zaragoza
kept
booming
even
as
the
overbuilt
mediterranean
coast
came
to
symbolize
how
real
estate
excess
was
not
just
an
american
ailment
but
just
as
the
cold
autumn
wind
is
blowing
down
from
the
pyrenees
zaragoza
and
the
surrounding
region
of
aragon
have
suddenly
been
hit
by
a
sharp
economic
downturn
and
the
troubles
here
make
clear
that
what
had
been
seen
as
a
crisis
confined
largely
to
finance
and
real
estate
is
quickly
spreading
to
more
fundamental
sectors
of
the
european
economy
such
as
manufacturing
for
the
generation
of
young
spaniards
who
have
known
only
good
economic
times
the
chill
is
shocking
maybe
older
people
are
not
surprised
but
this
is
totally
new
for
me

zaragozas

echoes
the
pattern
now
unfolding
across
spain
and
the
rest
of
europe
on
monday
the
european
commission
said
the

to
have

friday
that

more

the

to

jose
mendizabal
chief
executive
of
pikolin
spains
biggest
mattress
maker
and
one
of
the
largest
private
employers
in
this

people
are
frightened
of
spending

pikolin
has
already
eliminated
temporary
positions
bringing
its
work
force
down
to
1200
from
1400
but
the
slowdown
has
intensified
in
recent
weeks
with
sales
now
off
15
percent
from
a
year
earlier
and
more
job
cuts
are
likely
if
sales
do
not
improve
mendizabal
said
his
customers
are
a
barometer
of
the
broader
economy
firsttime
home
buyers
are
in
the

for

of

while

with

buy

they

he
said
the

a
day
was
one
of
seven
gm
plants
in
europe
to
go
on
hiatus
in
october
as
recently
as
this
past
spring
demand
was
still
so
strong
that
romuald
rytwinski
the
director
of
the
plant
had
to
rely
on
overtime
to
produce
enough
cars
the
overtime
disappeared
in
the
summer
but
there
was
little
warning
that
auto
sales
would
plunge
so
abruptly
indeed
europes
entire
auto
sector
is
now
suffering
with
daimler
cutting
its
2008
earnings
forecast
by
1
billion
euros
in
late
october
while
renault
and
fiat
have
also
issued
profit
warnings
in
the
past
you
could
forecast
demand
for
a
quarter
rytwinski
said
then
in
the
summer
for
about
a
month
now
were
talking
about
weeks
the
arrival
of
gm
here
26
years
ago
was
the
beginning
of
something
of
an
economic
miracle
for
this
region
which
had
been
agricultural
traditionally
and
sparsely
populated
drawn
by
zaragozas
historic
location
as
a
crossroads
between
spanish
cities
as
well
as
toulouse
in
france
gms
arrival
spurred
the
opening
of
additional
component
manufacturers
the
area
received
another
shot
in
the
arm
four
years
ago
when
zaragoza
was
chosen
to
host
the
2008
international
exposition
with
roughly
1
billion
euros
provided
by
the
spanish
government
and
other
sources
to
build
everything
from
a
glistening
new
bridge
designed
by
zaha
hadid
to
sprawling
pavilions
and
new
parkland
along
the
ebro
river
the
future
looked
bright
even
as
troubles
were
growing
elsewhere
people
in
their
20s
and
early
30s
have
never
known
anything
but
prosperity
said
amado
franco
president
of
aragons
biggest
savings
bank
ibercaja
at
62
franco
has
watched
zaragoza
along
with
the
rest
of
spain
transformed
by
prosperity
people
have
changed
he
said
in
my
generation
we
said
one
city
one
wife
one
company
my
childrens
generation
is
quite
different
ibercaja
with
its
fairly
conservative
lending
practices
remains
one
of
spains
strongest
savings
banks
but
franco
is
surprised
at
how
much
attitudes
toward
debt
shifted
during
the
boom
aragon
was
a
very
hard
land
with
very
hard
people
he
said
but
in
recent
years
he
said

of
the
head

to
go

gistau
the

now
finds
himself
trying
to
fill
the
18
million
square
feet
of
office
space
constructed
for
the
exhibition
he
claims
about
60
percent
has
been
sold
but
confessed
it
is
taking
a
long
time
to
find
buyers
for
the
rest
in
the
last
three
months
sales
have
come
to
a
complete
standstill
he
said
a
year
ago
i
was
sure
wed
sell
100
percent
with
the
expansion
joblessness
in
zaragoza
and
the
surrounding
aragon
region
fell
well
below
spains
traditionally
high
unemployment
rate
which
now
stands
at
more
than
11
percent
but
alberto
larraz
aragons
economic
minister
said
he
expected
the
local
jobless
rate
to
rise
from
its
current
62
percent
to
near
8
percent
by
the
end
of
the
year
with
no
improvement
in
2009
while
younger
workers
like
braulio
say
they
are
pessimistic
about
the
future
older
spaniards
like
gistau
say
they
remain
hopeful
that
it
will
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
the
good
days
return
citing
an
old
spanish
proverb
gistau
said
there
is
no
evil
that
lasts
for
100
years
color
is
essential
to
any
wardrobe
and
this
season
its
all
about
jewel
tones
just
a
pop
of
amethyst
emerald
or
sapphire
can
add
pizazz
to
any
ensemble

you
due

if
youre
unsure
about
a
certain
color
try
wearing
it
as
an
accessory
or
a
shoe
or
a
wrap
or
a
bag
he
says
we
paired
an
eggplantpurple
prada
bag
with
chocolate
brown
because
it
looked
so
chic
but
it
totally
depends
on
who
the
person
is
thats
where
life

comes

the

reveals
how
lupo
and
his

go
about
personalizing

for
their
celebrity
clientele
at
visual
therapy
in
new

with
the
help
of
questionnaires
photographs
color
swatches
and

any

the

can
determine
which
colors
suit
her
overall

best
how
will
she
know
the
person
will
actually
light
up
lupo
says
whenever
a
color
is
right
on
you
it
completely
complements
you
its
the
same
with
clothing
as
it
is
with
makeup
the
only
thing
left
is
to
make
it
work
lupo
suggests
playing
with
color
combinations
such
as
warm
butter
yellow
with
a
deep
purple
you
know
whats
fun
to
do
pair
emerald
with
charcoal
gray
raspberry
with
chocolate

navy
and
black
he
says
these
colors
actually
complement
each
other
for
more
inspiration
lupo
suggests
looking
to
style
icons
such
as
cate
blanchett
gwen
stefani
and
nicole
kidman
michelle
obama
is
another
favorite
shes
wearing
a
lot
of
color
and
shes
wearing
it
really
well
he
says
thats
a
good
example
of
someone
who
cant
afford
to
alienate
people
she
needs
to
look
happy

as

leading
reallife
soap

star
waging
a
series
of
wellpublicized

with

the

of
40

will
rest
on

shoulders

muchslimmed
after
a
stomachstapling
operation
in
2005

of
a
man
who
in
the
words
of
the
local
newspaper
columnist
horacio
pagani
will
be
the
least
prepared
manager
in
the
history
of
international
soccer
given
argentinas
string
of
disappointing
world
cup
performances
the
country
certainly
seems
like
it
could
use
a
supernatural
savior
the
team
was
sent
home
early
by
romania
in
1994
the
netherlands
in
1998
and
germany
in
2006
while
in
2002
it
failed
to
qualify
for
the
knockout
stage
altogether
maradona
has
predictably
brushed
off
concerns
about
his
readiness
noting
that
he
spent
two
decades
on
the
national
team
soccer
hasnt
changed
he
told
argentine
media
i
dont
think
anything
will
surprise
me
but
handing
him
the
reins
still
represents
a
profound
if
not
reckless
leap
of
faith
his
managing
resume
is
thin
and
checkered
in
199495
he
piloted
two
argentine
teams
to
just
three
wins
in
23
games
and
he
was
once
forced
to
call
the
shots
from
the
seats
since
a
suspension
for
ephedrine
use
prevented
him
from
sitting
on
the
bench
moreover
his
personal
track
record
hardly
suggests
he
is
fit
to
keep
a
23man
team
playing
in
lockstep
as
recently
as
march
2007
rumors
of
his
death
circulated
wildly
while
he
was
hospitalized
for
alcoholinduced
hepatitis
the
controversial
selection
will
not
become
official
until
november
4
when
the
executive
committee
of
argentinas
national
soccer
federation
is
scheduled
to
meet
but
that
group
serves
as
little
more
than
a
rubber
stamp
for
the
decisions
of
the
organizations
president
julio
grondona
and
his
pick
of
maradona
is
considered
a
fait
accompli
grondona
who
also
serves
as
a
vice
president
of
fifa
the
games
international
governing
body
is
widely
thought
to
run
the
national
sport
as
his
personal
fiefdom
over
his
29
years
in
office
he
has
regularly
been
accused
of
using
his
influence
over
referees
the
media
and
distribution
of
revenues
to
guarantee
obedience
from
the
club
presidents
who
elect
him

and
to
advance
his
numerous
related
business
interests
the
courts
have
ordered
some
50
searches
of
his
offices
during
his
presidency
but
few
formal
proceedings
have
ever
been
filed
against
him
and
he
has
never
been
found
guilty
of
any
crime
the
leading
candidate
for
the
job
which
became
available
after
the
previous
manager
resigned
last
month
was
carlos
bianchi
as
the
manager
of
boca
juniors

argentinas
most
popular
club
for
whom
maradona
played
in
198182
and
199597

bianchi
won
four
domestic
titles
three
continental
titles
and
two
intercontinental
titles
but
his
poor
relationship
with
grondona
appears
to
have
disqualified
him
for
the
post
sergio
batista
who
coached
argentinas
under23
team
to
the
olympic
gold
medal
in
beijing
was
also
passed
over
meanwhile
the
choice
of
maradona
is
sure
to
increase
the
international
profile

public

while

seems
to
lean

an

conducted

largest
newspaper
found
that
74
percent
of
nearly
50000
voters
were
opposed
purists
are
particularly
appalled
arguing
that
maradonas
indubitable
star
power
is
no
substitute
for
the
years
on
the
bench
accumulated
by
other
candidates
and
that
his
postretirement
antics
put
the
countrys
image
at
risk
he
was
a
great
player
but
nothing
more
said
oscar
pereira
a
union
employee
in
the
stands
at
a
local
league
game
on
friday
night
we
need
someone
more
serious
you
see
him
running
around
with
hugo
chavez
talking
about
che
guevara
moreover
accusations
of
cronyism
against
grondona
are
flying
more
freely
than
ever
whatever
money
they
make
off
maradona
grondona
and
his
friends
will
keep
it
for
themselves
said
raul
gamez
a
former
president
of
the
velez
sarsfield
club
and
one
of
grondonas
most
outspoken
critics
but
maradonas
mighty
stature
among
argentines
still
leaves
many
believing
he
deserves
a
shot

or
at
the
very
least
that
his
alltoopublic
campaign
for
the
position
forced
grondonas
hand
weve
had
a
lot
of
experienced
managers
and
they
havent
always
done
well
said
alejandro
fabbri
a
broadcaster
for
the
tyc
sports
network
if
maradona
wanted
the
job
he
should
get
it
hes
the
greatest
argentine
player
ever
at
least
they
wont
be
able
to
say
he
never
got
the
chance
to
compensate
for
maradonas
lack
of
training
grondona
has
also
appointed
a
team
of
veteran
tacticians
to
support
him
led
by
carlos
bilardo
who
managed
maradona
on
argentinas
1986
world
cup
championship
team
with
such
capable
assistants
maradonas
devotees
say
he
will
be
able
to
focus
on
providing
the
players
with
his
special
brand
of
leadership
and
inspiration
hes
the
biggest
name
there
is
said
pereiras
son
nahuel
who
accompanied
him
to
the
game
hell
pass
on
some
of
his
magic
to
them
while
argentines
may
disagree
over
the
merits
of
the
decision
they
share
a
concern
for
maradonas
wellbeing
in
his
new
role

perhaps
one
even
greater
than
their
worries
about
the
direction
of
the
team
as
a
whole
will
maradona

deity
survive
maradona

i
told
him
he
was

big
for

pagani

right
now
everyone
loves
him
once
he
starts
making

for

hell
be

hes
risking
his

but
he
said
that
he
wanted

do

tinged
with
emotion
as
he
briefly
spoke
of
her
death
at
a

here
she
died
peacefully
in

with
my

at

side
so
theres

joy
instead

obama
learned
of
his
grandmothers
death
at
8
am
on
monday
aides
said
but
carried
through
with
a
morning
rally
in

without
making

a

dunham
was
the
final
remaining
immediate
family

who
helped

he

his

a

term
for

obama
broke
from
the
presidential
campaign
trail
in
late
october
to
travel
to
honolulu
to
bid
his
grandmother
farewell
he
spent
part
of
two
days
with
her
as
she
lay
gravely
ill
in
the
small
apartment
where
he
lived
from
age
10
to
18
while
dunham
was
too
sick
to
travel
to
see
her
grandson
on
the
campaign
trail
obama
and
other
family
members
said
that
she
closely
followed
his
bid
for
the
presidency
through
cable
television
yet
she
became
a
figure
in
his
campaign
seen
through
images
in
television
commercials
intended
to
give
him
a
biographical
anchor
dunham
who
grew
up
near
august
kan
moved
with
her
husband
stanley
dunham
to
hawaii
in
the
early
stages
of
his
candidacy
obama
spoke
wistfully
about
his
grandparents
whose
allamerican
biography
suddenly
was
critical
to
establishing
his
own
american
story
he
spoke
of
how
his
grandmother
worked
on
b29s
at
a
boeing
plant
in
wichita
for
obama
the
loss
came
on
the
final
full
day
of
his
presidential
campaign
sen
john
mccain
and
his

cindy
offered
their
condolences
on
monday
saying
our
thoughts
and
prayers
go
out
to
them
as
they
remember
and
celebrate
the
life
of
someone
who
had
such
a
profound
impact
in
their
lives
his
grandmothers
illness
had
been
weighing
on
him
in
recent
weeks
friends
said
which
is
why
he
insisted
on
interrupting
his
schedule
to
visit
her
late
last
month
while
she
was
gravely
ill
aides
said
obama
carried
on
a
limited
conversation
with
her
he
kept
the
visit
to
one
day
advisers
said
partly
out
of
her
own
insistence
that
people
not
create
a
fuss
she
was
one
of
those
quiet
heroes
that
we
have
all
across
america
obama
said
theyre
not
famous
theyre
names
are
not
in
the
newspapers
but
each
and
every
day
they
work
hard
they
arent
seeking
the
limelight
all
they
try
to
do
is
just
do
the
right
thing
in
this
crowd
there
are
a
lot
of
quiet
heroes
like
that
mike
shanahan
isnt
the
only
beleaguered
head
coach
in
the
sunday
football
league
his
protege
gary
kubiak
isnt
exactly
tearing
it
up
in

john

up
the
texans
loss
at
minnesota
as
follows
look
up
roadkill
in

dictionary
and
you
know
which
team
picture
youll
find
that
would
be
the
local

in
houston
the
texans
have
shown
flashes
of
improvement
if
not
brilliance
during
kubiaks
regime
but
they
cant
win
on
the
road
to
wit
today
marks
the
oneyear
anniversary
since
their
last

victory
it
came
at
you

oakland
the

struggle
to
win
anywhere

last

the
texans
road
losing
streak
stands
at
seven
and
frankly
they
havent
competed
very
often
losing
by
an
average
of
13
points

31
at
home
this
season
where
theyve
outscored
their
opponents
by
an
average
score
of
3022
on
the
road
the
numbers
essentially
are
reversed
3219
anyone
can
see
that
kubiak
has
made
progress
in
the
twoplus
seasons
since
he
left
the
broncos
but
the
texans
if
theyre
going
to
be
legitimate
playoff
contenders
have
to
take
the
next
step
they
need
to
find
a
way
to
win

most
lethal
attack
of
the
day
6
people
were
killed
and

roadside
bombs
exploded
in
quick
succession
in

of
the
headquarters
of

unit
in
baghdads
central
karada

according
to
an

at
the

who
spoke
anonymously
because
he
was
not
authorized
to

the

officers
according
to
security
and
provincial
officials
ibrahim
bajlan
who
heads
the
diyala
provincial
council
said
the
attack
was
proof
that
the
situation
in
the
province
remained
fragile
and
that
the
governments
lauded
recent
security
operation
in
diyala
had
only
accomplished
a
fraction
of

said
that

the

discrimination
in

insurance
for

in
a
recent

the

law
center
found
that
women

both
young

middleaged

pay
dramatically
more
in
most
states
for

health
insurance
than
men
only
12
states
offer
gender
discrimination
protection
only
eight
offer
protections
for
age
and
only
15
offer
protections
for
health

according
to
the
report
insurers
in
nine
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
can
legally
reject
applicants
who
are
survivors
of
domestic
violence
in
many
states
insurers
can
reject

simply
for

pooling

this

could
be
adopted
by

or
it

be
applied

the

of

are

from

in

they
get
it

noland

for
simply

and
again
for

said
that
there
is
no
justification
for
this
kind
of

likening
it
to
using

the

into

mccain
has
promised

to
people
who
have
the
most
difficulty
on

his

tax
credit

would
be
worth
less
to

in
most
of

ending

would
be
crucial
to
making
such
a
tax
credit
fair
for
obama
who
said
he
will
require

the

have
been
in
china
since
thursday
for
what
could
turn
out
to
be
decisive
talks
on
the
future
status
of
tibet
the
chinese
authorities
would
be
wise
to
seize
this
opportunity
to
negotiate
a
mutually
acceptable
form
of
autonomy
for
tibet
if
chinese
leaders
try
to
string
out
a
futile
dialogue
until
the
tibetans
revered
leader
the
dalai
lama
dies
they
will
be
making
a
grave
mistake
younger
tibetans
appalled
at
being
an
oppressed
minority
in
their
own
land
cannot
be
counted
on
to
preserve
the
dalai
lamas
devotion
to
nonviolence
and
if
china
hopes
to
play
a
role
on
the
world
stage
commensurate
with
its
economic
importance
its
leadership
cannot
be
enmeshed
in
a
chronic
conflict
over
tibet
after
six
years
of
fruitless
exchanges
with
chinese
officials
the
tibetans
are
seeking
to
determine
if
beijings
idea
of
autonomy
for
tibet
can
be
compatible
with
the
tibetan
aspiration
for
an
autonomy
that
preserves
tibets
cultural
and
religious
uniqueness
within
the
borders
of
china
toward
that
end
the
dalai
lamas
representatives
intend
to
base
their
version
of
autonomy
on
existing
chinese
law
they
are
hoping
for
a
substantive
exchange
of
views
on
the
chinese
and
tibetan
interpretations
of
that
law
if
there
is
a
useful
overlapping
of
those
interpretations
it
will
give
a
positive
cast
to
a
strategy
meeting
that
the
dalai
lama
has
called
for
midnovember
in

if
not
the

will
have
to
reconsider
their

in

the

will
be
acting
in

tuesday
marks
the
end
of
a
battle
that
has
lasted
for
more
than
two
years
with
each
side
predicting
apocalyptic
consequences
should
it
lose
not
the
fight
for
the
presidency

the
one
pitting
google
against
dolly
parton
the
titan
of
silicon
valley
and
the
queen
of
country
are
two
of
the
many
combatants
in
a
hightechnology
dispute
over
precious
slices
of
the
nations
airwaves
the
issue
comes
to
a
head
on
election
day
when
the
federal
communications
commission
votes
on
a
proposal
to
make
a
disputed
chunk
of
radio
spectrum
available
for
public
use
google
microsoft
hewlettpackard
and
other
technology
companies
say
the
spectrum
could
be
used
by
a
whole
new
array
of
internetconnected
wireless
gadgets
they
say
freeing
it
up
would
encourage
innovation
and
investment
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
spread
of
wifi
technology
has
this
would
generate
more
business
for
technology
companies
but
a
coalition
of
oldguard
media

from
television
networks
to
broadway
producers

is
objecting
to
the
proposal
saying
it
needs
a
closer
look
the
opponents
argue
that
signals
sent
over
those
frequencies
could
interfere
with
broadcasts
and
wireless
microphones
at
live
productions
the
measure
appears
likely
to
pass
though
its
opponents
have
mounted
a
spirited
latestage
lobbying
effort
supported
by
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
dny
and
others
in
congress
also
opposed
are
the
professional
sports
leagues
las
vegas
casinos
a
coalition
of
rock
musicians
and
of
late
parton
who
is
soon
to
open
a
broadway
show
called
9
to
5
the
musical
if
the
spectrum
is
set
free
parton
says
chaos
could
reign
on
broadway

in
the
form
of
static
and
other
interference
the
potential
direct
negative
impact
on
countless
people
may
be
immeasurable
parton
wrote
in
a
letter
last
month
to
the
fcc
urging
it
not
to
release
the
frequencies
parton
became
involved
after
she
was
contacted
by
the
broadway
league
a
theater
industry
trade
group
that
has
lobbied
the
fcc
on
the
issue
and
coordinated
support
from
performers
the
trade
group
said
parton
had
been
more
engaged
than
other
performers
because
she
was
also
a
producer
of
live
shows
in
the
digital
era
airwaves
carrying
television
cell
phone
and
wireless
internet
signals
are
highly
valuable
the
fcc
regulates
the
spectrum
and
auctions
off
licenses
for
its
use

in
some
cases
for
billions
of
dollars

to
private
companies
but
in
this
case
it
is
considering
setting
aside
a
free
or
unlicensed
section
for
public
use
technology
companies
argue
that
if
it
does
so
entrepreneurs
and
innovators
will
create
a
new
generation
of
devices
that
transmit
signals
farther
and
more
reliably
than
wifi
which
also
relies
on
unlicensed
spectrum
the
technology
could
also
handle
cheap
internetbased
phone
calls
this
could
lead
to
wifi
on
steroids
said
richard
whitt
a
washington
lobbyist
for
google
on
telecommunications
issues
it
could
become
a
ubiquitous
nationwide
broadband
network
the
battle
between
the
old
media
and
new
media
companies
is
a
byproduct
of
an
impending
change
in
the
way
overtheair
tv
signals
are
delivered
in
february
tv
stations
will
be
required
to
switch
from
analog
broadcasting
to
digital
which
is
less
susceptible
to
radio
interference
since
2004
the
fcc
has
been
studying
whether
it
might
make
better
use
of
some
white
spaces
tv
frequencies
that
are
not
being
used
by
broadcast
channels
these
frequencies
have
traditionally
been
left
largely
empty
because
broadcasters
send
out
such
powerful
signals
that
a
buffer
is
needed
between
channels
the
theory
behind
the
fcc
proposal
is
that
handheld
devices
and
other
gadgets
emit
such
low
levels
of
power
that
their
transmissions
will
not
overlap
or
interfere
with
the
digital
tv
signals
also
the
proposals
supporters
say
devices
can
be
made
smart
enough
to
sense
when
they
might
interfere
with
a
broadcast
signal
and
find
another
frequency
the
fcc
has
been
studying
the
potential
for
interference
and
found
that
most
problems
can
be
avoided
through
tight
regulation
of
the
new
devices
said
kevin
j
martin
chairman
of
the
fcc
who
proposed
the
white
space
measure
were
being
very
cautious
about
protecting
the
broadcasters
but
at
the
same
time
making
sure
the
technology
allows
us
to
make
greater
use
of
this
invaluable
resource
martin
said
he
added
that
he
thought
some
opponents
like
the
broadcasters
were
fighting
the
proposal
because
they
were
unnerved
by
the
rise
of
interactive
tools
that
offered
a
less
passive
media
experience
the
empowerment
of
consumers
is
threatening
he
said
the
fivemember
commission
seems
likely
to
approve
the
measure
according
to
several
people
who
were
involved
in
the
agencys
internal
discussions
but
who
declined
to
be
named
because
they
were
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
beneath
the
surface
of
the
debate
are
shifts
in
politics
and
culture
heavy
internet
and
computer
adoption
by
consumers
has
given
the
technology
lobby
more
power
and
prominence
at
the
same
time
the
broadcast
industry
has
lost
some
of
its
lobbying
sway
as
consumer
tastes
have
changed
and
advertising
dollars
have
flowed
to
the
internet
still
the
national
association
of
broadcasters
which
represents
8300
local
and
national
television
stations
is
helping
lead
the
effort
to
get
the
fcc
to
postpone
a
decision
on
the
measure
without
more
testing
this
could
be
a
recipe
for
potentially
massive
interference
into
the
television
spectrum
said
dennis
wharton
a
spokesman
for
the
broadcasting
trade
group
arguing
that
tv
screens
could
go
temporarily
dark
or
that
pictures
could
freeze
broadcasters
say
the
signal
could
even
disrupt
channels
received
over
cable
the
interests
of
tv
providers
is
different
from
those
of
broadway
theaters
which
rely
on
wireless
microphones
to
broadcast
sound
to
the
audience
and
for
communication
among
crew
members
gerald
schoenfeld
chairman
of
the
shubert
organization
a
broadway
production
company
said
new
gadgets
that
were
intended
to
use
the
disputed
frequencies
could
interfere
with
the
450
wireless
microphones
used
in
new
yorks
theater
district
that
could
lead
to
static
he
said
or
worse

if
for
instance
crew
member
communications
were
hindered
causing
an
accident
such
as
a
falling
set
piece
theres
a
danger
element
attached
to
this
schoenfeld
said
they
are
fooling
with
many
aspects
of
american
society
under
the
pretext
of
helping
get
internet
access
for
parties
that
already
have
the
greatest
amount
of
internet
usage
urging
a
delay
on
the
vote
schoenfeld
added
why
this
is
being
rushed
through
at
this
time
is
mystifying
the
wireless
microphone
technology
used
for
broadway
shows
and
other
events
uses
some
of
the
same
frequencies
that
regulators
would
like
to
open
up
for
wireless
data
but
under
the
fcc
proposal
these
incumbent
users
would
be
given
first
rights
to
the
space
in
her
letter
to
the
fcc
parton
conceded
that
she
did
not
understand
all
the
technicalities
of
the
debate
but
based
on
the
counsel
of
others
she
concluded
that
the
potential
problems
were
serious
a
dangerous
and
shortsighted
answer
to
a
highly
complicated
question
the
broadway
league
and
partons
representatives
said
she
was
too
busy
to
comment
further
for
his
part
eric
e
schmidt
the
chief
executive
of
google
sent
his
own
letter
to
the
fcc
recently
we
are
eight
days
away
from
a
vote
that
could
transform
the
way
we
connect
to
the
internet
he
wrote
the
time
for
study
and
talk
is
over
the
time
for
action
has
arrived
and
so
it
ends
the
longest
most
expensive
and
riveting
campaign
in
living
memory
is
finally
over
it
has
been
an
international
cliffhanger
with
people
in
europe
africa
and
asia
following
every
little
twist
and
turn
as
avidly
as
anyone
in
the
united

they

not
have

all
the

knows
the
importance
of
americas
choice
seldom
has
there
been
such
an
allencompassing

it
seems
almost
too
theatrical
remembering
now
how
the
clintons
so
full
of
confidence
and
entitlement
were
brought
low
by
a
newcomer
of

most
people
had
never
heard
five

before
and

his

in
tatters
and
out
of

in

hampshire
prevailing
over
the
deepndashpocketed
mitt
romney
whose
positions
kept
shifting
with
the
political
winds
books
and
magazines
are
full
of
advice
on
what
our
new
president
faces
in
his
first
term
pundits
are
saying
that
not
since
franklin
roosevelt
or
perhaps
abraham
lincoln
has
the
task
been
so
daunting
given
the
messes
that
president
bush
and
dick
cheney
are
leaving
on
the
white
house
floor
two
unfinished
wars
a
national
debt
rising
to
dangerous
levels
an
army
stretched
to
the
breaking
point
and
an
economy
in
shambles
limit
the
ability
of
a
new
president
to
carry
out
anything
new
given
the
political
establishments
inertia
the
lack
of
maneuver
room
the
new
president
will
have
and
the
allbut
insurmountable
difficulties
he
faces
it
may
be
as
a
recent
new
yorker
cartoon
suggested
that
real
change
can
only
be
found
in
drink
during
the
change
you
can
believe
in
hour
at
your
local
bar
looking
back
the
most
amazing
aspect
of
the
bush
years
was
not
the
arrogance
and
imperial
overreach
it
was
its
sheer
incompetence
it
was
something
unexpected
when
bush
came
to
power
given
his
team
colin
powell
donald
rumsfeld
and
yes
dick
cheney
i
thought
at
least
they
could
get
things
done
for
better
or
worse
but
it
became
clear
before
their
armies
reached
baghdad
that
this
was
a
quick
unplanned
dash
with
no
followthrough
how
agonizingly
slow
the
administration
was
to
admit
even
to
an
insurgency
in
iraq
how
slow
it
was
to
recognize
the
damage
that
hurricane
katrina
had
inflicted
and
how
slow
it
was
to
realize
that
pushing
reaganera
deregulation
too
far
was
about
to
beggar
us
all
although
bush
has
been
keeping
such
a
low
profile
up
to
now
that
many
could
be
forgiven
for
thinking
he
has
already
left
office
the
grim
and
sobering
truth
is
that
he
has
77
days
left
in
power
enough
time
to
do
a
lot
of
mischief
the
administration
is
now
free
of
any
responsibility
to
the
republican
party
or
the
election
as
for
the
american
people
they
were
never
considered
by
this
administration
to
be
anything
more
than
an
entity
to
be
manipulated
and
lied
to
in
the
interest
of
unrestricted
executive
power
the
danger
of
an
american
attack
on
iran
has
now
passed
there
would
be
stiff
resistance
from
the
pentagon
and
the
neoconservative
hawks
that
held
such
sway
in
bushs
first
administration
are
now
in
eclipse
bush
and
cheney
might
give
israel
the
green
light
however
i
was
told
by
a
source
whom
i
trust
that
prime
minister
ehud
olmert
of
israel
sought
a
promise
from
bush
that
he
would
bomb
iran
before
he
left
office
such
an
attack
would
delay
not
stop
iran
from
building
a
bomb
and
the
results
of
an
attack
the
political
fallout
in
the
middle
east
and
around
the
world
would
be
the
only
thing
worse
than
iran
having
a
bomb
to
bring
about
real
change
in
the
world
the
new
president
will
have
to
rethink
and
reorganize
the
entire
concept
of
preventive
war
and
the
socalled
war
on
terror
as
the
author
thomas
powers

what
no
country
can
do
for
long
is
force
strange
people
in
distant
places
to
reshape
their
politics
and
society
more
to
our
liking
the
effort
passes
as
nationbuilding
at
the
outset
but
in
the
long
run
counterinsurgency
always
comes
down
to
the
same
selfdefeating
strategy

support
democrat

shaheen
in
her
bid
for
us
senate
in
congress
four
massachusetts
incumbents
are
facing
challenges
and
we
urge
votes
for
democrats
barney
frank
in
the
fourth
district

a
smart
and
steady
hand
in
the
current
financial
crisis

and
john

in

edward
j
markey
in
the
seventh
and
john

in
the
first
district
in

we
took
sides
in
10
selected
races
in
the
second
suffolk
district
in
boston
we
endorse
sonia
rosa
changdiaz
for
state
senate

now
more
than
ever
in
the
middlesex
and
worcester
district
representative
james
b

deserves
elevation
to
a
senate
seat
and
in
the
norfolk
bristol
and
middlesex
district
sara
orozco
is
a
promising
newcomer
there
are
three
lively
races
for
open
seats
in
the

house
we
choose
democrats
kate

in
the
third
middlesex

hudson

maynard
and
bolton
jason

in
the

and
carolyn

holliston

elsewhere
in

we
support
house
minority
leader
bradley
h

of
north
reading
for
reelection
in
the
20th
middlesex
district
and
republican
bradford

also
for

we
support
barbara
a
litalien
democrat
of
andover
in
the
18th
essex
district
and
thomas
p
conroy
democrat
of
wayland
who
is
in
a

for
his
13th

questions
initiative

generally
use

and
no
instrument
is
blunter
than
question
1
the
reckless
idea
to
eliminate
the
state
income
tax
we
urge
all
massachusetts
citizens
to
vote
no
on
question
1
we
also
urge
no
on
question
2
the
proposal
to
decriminalize
possession
of
marijuana
because
we
believe
law
enforcement
and
community
leaders
who
say
it
is
the
wrong
answer
to
flaws
in
the
system
the
proposal
to
ban
dog
racing
in
massachusetts
is
a
closer
call
but
we
do
not
agree
that
dog
racing
is
inherently
cruel
and
the
evidence
of
harm
to
the
animals
is
not
compelling
enough
to
eliminate
the
business
we
recommend
no
on
question

few
actions
by
a
new
president
would
draw
a
clearer
distinction
with
president
bush
than
a
pledge
on
inauguration
day
to
close
the
guantanamo
bay
detention
center
and
to
adhere
to
the
geneva
conventions
in
the
handling
of
war
on
terror
prisoners
during
the
campaign
both
john
mccain
and
barack
obama
called
for
closing
guantanamo
which
has
become
a
symbol
of
the
bush
administrations
humanrights
abuses
mccain
proposed
a
sensible
alternative
the
military
prison
at
fort
leavenworth
kansas
even
bush
has
said
he
wants
to
shutter
the
cuban
prison
but
he
has
made
no
progress
toward
doing
so
simply
duplicating
the
legal
conditions
of
guantanamo
on
us
soil
would
do
little
to
restore
americas
reputation
as
a
humanrights
leader
however
the
new
president
must
also
act
quickly
to
return
to
prisoners
the
rights
denied
by
congress
in
2006
that
is
why
it
would
be
so
important
for
the
new
president
to
repledge
us
adherence
to
the
geneva
conventions
common
article
3
holds
that
trials
of
both
prisoners
of
war
and
of
captured
combatants
not
granted
that
status
must
adhere
to
judicial
guarantees
recognized
as
indispensable
by
all
civilized
peoples
the
supreme
court
has
already
ruled
that
congress
acted
unconstitutionally
in
stripping
prisoners
of
their
habeas
corpus
rights
the
2006
law
also
permits
evidence
gained
through
coercive
methods
and
limits
inmates
rights
to
confront
witnesses
about
255
prisoners
remain
at
guantanamo
of
the
more
than
700
brought
there
most
have
returned
to
their
home
countries
in
the
almost
seven
years
since
the
military
began
sending
detainees
there
just
two
have
been
convicted
of
any
criminal
offense
federal
criminal
courts
in
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand
have
successfully
tried
and
convicted
such
major
terrorists
as
shoebomber
richard
reid
and
the
sept
11
conspirator
zacarias
moussaoui
as
well
as
other
foreign
and
domestic
terrorists
from
the
presept
11
era
humanrights
advocates
disagree
on
whether
a
new
president
could
switch
prisoners
to
federal
courts
from
the
military
commission
tribunals
by
executive
order
some
believe
he
would
need
congress
to
repeal
or
drastically
amend
the
2006
law
whatever
the
case
the
new
president
should
make
closing
guantanamo
and
shifting
its
inmates
to
federal
court
jurisdiction
a
priority
for
his
first
100
days
four
years
ago
this
month
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
took
to
the
streets
of
this
capital
city
to
take
back
an
election
they
saw
as
stolen
that
outpouring
called
the
orange
revolution
brought
fresh
hopes
for
freedoms
and
for
a
release
from
the
countrys
soviet
past
that
few
other
former
republics
had
ever
experienced
the
early
promise
of
those
days
frayed
in
recent
years
but
economically
times
were
good
and
the
country
always
seemed
to
manage
but
now
confronted
by
the
global
financial
crisis
the
new
ukraine
is
facing
the
single
biggest
test
of
its
stability
and
its
leaders
by
most
accounts
seem
to
be
at
risk
of
failing
prime
minister
yulia
v
tymoshenko
and
president
viktor
a
yushchenko
former
political
allies
are
now
locked
in
a
bitter
power
struggle
that
has
paralyzed
the
state
leaving
it
without
a
leader
at
precisely
the
time
it
most
needs
one
even
as
the
west
bends
to
help
it
with
the
international
monetary
fund
pledging
an
emergency
165
billion
loan
last
month
it
barely
pulled
itself
together
to
meet
the
conditions
for
the
money
yushchenko
intent
on
getting
rid
of
tymoshenko
is
trying
to
force
early
elections
for
december
to
make
sure
the
elections
come
off
his
party
spent
most
of
last
week
trying
to
slip
a
campaign
finance
clause
into
the
legislation
package
that
was
required
for
the
loan
on
monday
he
relented
and
signed
the
crisis
legislation
into
law
without
the
clause
but
his
administration
continued
to
insist
that
the
elections
proceed
it
is
a
crime
to
conduct
elections
in
this
situation
said
yulia
mostova
editor
in
chief
of
dzerkalo
tyzhnya
a
weekly
newspaper
published
in
kiev
the
chain
of
authority
in
ukraine
is
broken
its
at
war
with
itself
ukraines
paralysis
raises
difficult
questions
for
the
west
it
is
a
country
of
46
million
in
a
strategic
spot
between
european
union
countries
and
russia
and
its
stability
is
crucial
to
the
region
yushchenko
has
taken
a
combative
approach
toward
russia
which
demonstrated
a
new
willingness
to
settle
disputes
by
force
in
georgia
this
summer
he
has
pushed
for
ukraine
to
join
nato
an
agenda
that
is
not
particularly
popular
among
ukrainians
17
percent
of
whom
are
ethnic
russians
and
he
has
vowed
not
to
renew
a
contract
that
allows
russias
black
sea
fleet
to
dock
in
a
ukrainian
port
on
saturday
a
ban
on
russian
cable
television
programming
went
into
effect
for
ukrainians
the
fears
are
more
about
their
immediate
future
at
one
point
last
week
their
currency
hit
its
lowest
point
since
it
was
introduced
in
1996
and
securities
that
insure
ukrainian
government
debt
are
trading
at
neardefault
levels
but
perhaps
their
greatest
disappointment
is
over
their
leaders
whose
energies
are
focused
not
on
ways
to
lift
the
country
out
of
crisis
but
instead
on
what
is
widely
seen
as
a
selfish
struggle
over
power
people
feel
let
down
to
the
point
of
tears
mostova
said
many
feel
theyve
been
used
ukraine
had
a
chance
for
a
qualitative
civilized
jump
forward
but
it
wasnt
taken
ukraines
economy
is
particularly
vulnerable
about
40
percent
of
its
foreign
currency
earnings
come
from
the
sale
of
industrial
metals
which
have
plunged
in
price
in
recent
weeks
and
while
its
government
has
borrowed
responsibly
its
banks
have
not
having
taken
billions
of
dollars
in
foreign
currency
loans
with
global
credit
markets
drying
up
those
loans
will
be
difficult
to
refinance
ukraines
central
bank
has
already
had
to
bail
out
one
prominvestbank
the
countrys
sixth
largest
despite
the
turmoil
yushchenkos
main
focus
in
recent
weeks
has
been
on
attacking
tymoshenko
he
has
issued
presidential
decrees
blocking
the
majority
of
her
decisions
since
she
became
prime
minister
for
the
second
time
in
december
she
accused
him
of
commandeering
her
plane
shortly
before
she
was
to
take
off
on
a
trip
to
russia
in
october
an
allegation
he
denied
and
when
a
judge
in
kiev
ruled
that
the
presidents
decree
to
dissolve
the
parliament
and
call
elections
was
illegal
yushchenko
simply
disbanded
the
court
yushchenko
thinks
he
is
god
said
mikhail
pogrebinsky
a
political
analyst
at
a
research
and
polling
center
in
kiev
citing
as
evidence
yushchenkos
visit
last
week
to
istanbul
where
he
gave
patriarch
bartholomew
i
of
the
eastern
orthodox
church
a
specially
minted
coin
with
his
image
on
it
while
at
home
his
countrys
currency
was
plummeting
he
thinks
his
own
fate
and
the
fate
of
the
country
are
the
same
thing
tymoshenko
is
also
capable
of
political
magic
tricks
last
year
she
colluded
with
yushchenko
withdrawing
all
her
deputies
from
parliament
to
give
him
legal
justification
for
dissolving
it
and
calling
new
elections

there
are
even
hints
of
the
political

in
yushchenkos
infamous
poisoning
episode
which
left
his
face
pockmarked
and
ravaged
in
2004
a
lineup
of
his
political
opponents
have
been
called
in
for
questioning
in
the
case
tymoshenko
came
from
ukraines
business
world
where
quick
wits
and
bare
knuckles
made
fortunes
in
the
1990s
under
the
corrupt
government
of
president
leonid
d
kuchma
but
her
aim
appeared
to
be
less
money
than
power
and
she
later
joined
the
government
she
and
yushchenko
rose
up
against
kuchma
in
2004
with
the
motto
bandits
to
prisons
but
they
soon
grew
beholden
to
yet
another

popular
student
movement
against

soviet
regime
in
1990
compared
ukraines
first
generation
businessmen
to
divers
dizzy
with
the

the
ukrainian
business
elite
was
born
too
quickly
he
said
there
were
few
moral
limits
there
was
no
sense
of
social
responsibility
of
sharing
with
retirees
the
countrys
current
predicament
is
not
entirely
the
fault
of
its
leaders
it
runs
much
deeper
into
the
roots
of
ukrainian
society
communism
pitted
citizens
against
one
another
leaving
people
distrustful
and
incapable
of
the
collective
action
that
holds
governments
accountable
in
developed
countries
we
trust
our
brother
son
father
mother
and
godfather
but
no
one
else
said
mostova
the
editor
thats
our
problem
that
is
why
the
orange
revolution
was
so
important
it
seemed
to
break
that
pattern
people
found
their
backbones
mostova
said
they
cried
in
front
of
strangers
but
after
the
protests
were
over
there
was
little
followup
no
committees
associations
or
new
communities
the
crowd
came
together
and
then
broke
apart
still
the
fact
that
it
happened
at
all
was
a
big
step
forward
for
ukraine
which
has
been
independent
for
only
17
years
and
is
now
going
through
a
period
that
pogrebinsky
compares
with
the
tumultuous
late
18th
century
in
the
united
states
during
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
the
economic
crisis
for
all
its
pain
may
also
be
a
catalyst
financial
turmoil
has
swept
out
governments
in
indonesia
turkey
and
russia
in
recent
history
and
even
many
argue
the
soviet
union
todays
ukraine
may
be
similarly
susceptible
tymoshenko
seems
to
realize
this
in
a
television
talk
show
about
the
economic
crisis
on
friday
night
she
extended
a
hand
to
yushchenko
lets
for
once
not
get
into
these
political
dogfights
and
come
together
as
a
national
team
with
a
united
program
like
the
president
said
she
declared
addressing
the
other
political
leaders
seated
in
the
studio
be
a
team
in
the
face
of
this
big
global
challenge
yushchenko
did
not
return
the
favor
he
accused
tymoshenkos
government
of
accumulating
debts
from
energy
purchases
like
fleas
on
a
dog
and
of
allowing
inflation
to
rise
who
did
it
he
railed
the
world
crisis
lies
the
crisis
is
sitting
right
here
tuesday
would
just
be
the
beginning
the
candidates
kept
telling
us
the
start
of
a
new
era
in
american
public
life
but
for
everyone
from
pollsters
to
pundits
to
a
public
thats
been
immersed
in
an
historic
and
closely
monitored
campaign
for
nearly
two
years
election
day
also
represents
the
end
of
a
long
and
exhausting
story
line
is
the
country
in
for
an
emotional
and
psychological
letdown
now
that
the
climax
finally
has
arrived
this
year
more
than
in
a
very
long
time
come
the
day
after
the
election
its
going
to
feel
like
the
entire
nation
has
woken
up
in
a
collective
political
equivalent
of
dec
26
predicts
robert

founding
director
of

bleier
center
for

look
more
promising
before
theyre
opened
the
tree
is
starting
to
look
a
little
funky
reality
sets
in
thompson
argues
that
because
the
2008
campaign
has
had
so
many
unprecedented
factors
including
the
first
serious
runs
for
the
white
house
by
both
an
african
american
and
a
woman
an
economic
crisis
that
gave
everyone
a
lifeanddeath
stake
in
the
outcome
and
the
heightened
proliferation
of
political
satire
on
saturday
night
live
and
elsewhere
the
falloff
from
this
extraordinarily
resonant
and
mythic
american
narrative
could
be
especially
steep
switching
metaphors
from
christmas
to

thompson
says
the
period
between
election
day
and
the
inauguration
of
a
new
president
in
january
might
feel
like
those
times
when
the
sopranos
was
on
hiatus
this
has
been
the
greatest
series
on
television
he
says
and
now
its
stopped
but
it
will
pick
up
again
in

she
said
in

likening
the
draw
of

season
to
that
of
a
daytime
tv
drama
the
end
of
that
said
epel
could
bring
in
nuances
of
letdown
but
she
also
envisions
a
more
layered
response
even
as
the
conclusion
of
the
soap
opera
might
signal
the
beginning
of
a

chuck

chairman
of

says
he
has
been
thinking
about
a

theyve
become
really
tight
says

its

plans
to
catch
up
on
her
neglected
business
of

another
hopes
to
get

pollster

sees
no

letdown
for

predicting
an

he
says
this

is
transformational
i
am
suggesting
that
2009
will
be
one
of
the
very
few
years
of
major
reform
in
american
history
zogby
concedes
that
a
letdown
will
come
eventually
expectations
are
very
high
for
immediate

not
fellow
standup
comedian
nato
green
says
the
bush
years
have
made
it
easy
to
be
lazy

anyone
could
recycle
a
redneck
joke
and
get
a
laugh
if
obama
is
elected
he
continues
its
going
to
impose
more
market
discipline
on
comics
who
want
to
bring
forward
a
point
of
view
and
perspective
some
people
think
it
will
be
hard
to
make
fun
of
obama
because
hes
black
i
think
its
because
hes
relatively
lucid
as
for
the
national
parodists
and
pundits
who
have
attracted
viewers
in
the
runup
to
this
closely
watched
election

says
it
may
take
a
while
to
see
how
they
fare
in
the

tina
fey

rose
with
her

saw
the
ratings
for
her
primetime
series
30
rock
hit
their
highest
numbers
ever
with
last
weeks
thirdseason
premiere
part
of
that
might
be
due
to
her
emmy
wins
in
september
but
part
of
it
also
has
to
do
with
her
ability
to
mimic
the
alaska
governor
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
such
ratings
will
hold
up
a
month
from
now
thompson
points
out
that
big

stories
can
cement
a

im
also
a

be

iversons

leon

said
ai
had
a
great

enjoyed
playing
in
denver
this
is
an
opportunity

i

on

at

one
broadcast
network
and
one
web
site
said
monday
that
they
could
foresee
signaling
to
viewers
early
tuesday
evening
which
candidate
appeared
likely
to
win
the
presidency
despite
the
unreliability
of
early
exit
polls
in
the
last
presidential
election
a
senior
vice
president
of
cbs
news
paul
friedman
said
the
prospects
for
barack
obama
or
john
mccain
meeting
the
minimum
threshold
of
electoral
votes
could
be
clear
as
soon
as
8
pm

before
polls
in
even
new
york
and
rhode
island
close
let
alone
those
in
texas
and
california
at
such
a
moment

determined
from
a
combination
of
polling
data
and
samples
of
actual
votes

the
network
could
share
its
preliminary
projection
with
viewers
friedman
said
we
could
know
virginia
at
7
he
said
we
could
know
indiana
before
8
we
could
know
florida
at
8
we
could
know
pennsylvania
at
8
we
could
know
the
whole
story
of
the
election
with
those
results
we
cant
be
in
this
position
of
hiding
our
heads
in
the
sand
when
the
story
is
obvious
similarly
the
editor
of
slate
david
plotz
said
in
an
email
message
that
if
obama
is
winning
heavily
he
could
see
calling
the
race
sometime
between
8
and
9
our
readers
are
not
stupid
and
we
shouldnt
engage
in
a
weird
kabuki
drama
that
pretends
mccain
could
win
california
and
thus
the
presidency
plotz
wrote
we
will
call
it
when
a
sensible
person

not
a
tv
news
anchor
who
has
to
engage
in
a
silly
pretense
about
west
coast
voters

would
call
it
all
the
networks
and
other
news
organizations
with
their
own
web
sites
were
engaging
in
similar
debates
on
monday
about
striking
the
following
balance
not
relying
too
much
on
early
exit
poll
data

which
had
suggested
at
least
early
on
election
day
in
2004
that
john
kerry
might
be
on
track
to
defeat
george
w
bush

while
not
being
so
cautious
as
to
be
beaten
to
the
punch
by
a
competitor
who
announces
an
emerging
result
first
when
asked
how
katie
couric
who
is
leading
the
networks
coverage
might
present
the
networks
projection
to
viewers
friedman
said
he
could
imagine
her
saying
for
example
given
what
we
know
about
the
results
or
the
projected
results
in
various
states
its
beginning
to
look
like
it
will
be
very
difficult
for
john
mccain
to
put
together
enough
votes
to
win
this
election
the
decision
desk
director
of
abc
news
dan
merkle
said
i
think
at
abc
were
going
to
be
more
cautious
than
that
in
terms
of
telegraphing
which
way
the
election
is
going
merkle
said
he
was
particularly
concerned
about
how
much
stock
to
put
in
surveys
of
voters
as
they
leave
the
polls
which
are
sometimes
fine
and
which
sometimes
have
had
overstatements
on
democratic
candidates
in
particular
we
may
have
some
indications
from
that
data
merkle
said
thats
different
than
going
on
the
air
to
report
that
with
some
national
polls
suggesting
that
obama
was
heading
for
a
potential
electoral
landslide
news
organizations
were
preparing
for
a
race
that
could
be
far
less
close
than
those
in
2004
or
2000
the
nearest
precedent
could
be
1980
when
the
networks
projected
ronald
reagan
to
have
defeated
jimmy
carter
shortly
after
the
polls
closed
in
the
east
later
the
secretaries
of
state
from
washington
oregon
and
other
western
states
argued
that
as
a
result
of
the
networks
early
call
that
year
voter
turnout
in
california
dropped
by
about
2
percent
other
experts
though
have
argued
that
any
impact
by
the
networks
on
turnout
was
far
outweighed
by
jimmy
carters
having
made
a
concession
speech
shortly
after
the
networks
broadcast
their
results
whatever
the
networks
decide
it
seemed
clear
on
monday
that
they
would
disregard
a
plea
by
rep
john
d
dingell
dmich
to
hold
off
projecting
a
winner
until
polls
in
the
last
state
had
closed
those
would
be
alaskas
which
are
to
remain
open
until
1
am
on
the
east
coast
when
a
candidate
gets
270
electoral
votes
theyre
the
next
president
said
sheldon
gawiser
director
of
elections
for
nbc
news
if
some
states
are
still
voting
its
an
unfortunate
circumstance
thats
what
it
is
the
founding
fathers
never
expected
us
to
count
the
votes
fast
in
something
of
a
compromise
cnn
said
it
might
tell
its
viewers
that
another
news
organization
had
called
a
particular
state
but
that
it
was
holding
off
and
for
what
reason
in
2004
early
exit
poll
data
that
suggesting
kerry
was
ahead
began
circulating
within
newsrooms

and
leaking
out
on
web
sites
including
slates

early
in
the
afternoon
on
election
day
this
year
the
consortium
of
six
news
organizations
gathering
the
exit
poll
data

nbc
abc
cbs
fox
cnn
and
the
associated
press

have
agreed
to
keep
the
information
under
quarantine
until
5
pm
representatives
of
those
news
organizations
will
begin
analyzing
that
information
at
a
secret
location
beginning
in
late
morning
but
will
have
to
surrender
all
electronic
devices
at
the
door
even
restroom
visits
will
be
supervised
there
were
already
signs
on
monday
that
the
additional
security
was
paying
off
we
wont
call
it
off
exit
polls
plotz
said
in
part
because
we
dont
expect
to
get
them
leaked
to
us
much
before
the
first
results
whoever
gets
elected
president
on
tuesday
one
hotbutton
issue
from
this
long
campaign
will
keep
hounding
wall
street
executive
pay
both
barack
obama
and
john
mccain
have
criticized
the
six
and
sevenfigure
paychecks
that
wall
streets
top
brass
collected
in
recent
years
while
driving
their
companies

and
the
entire
financial
system

into
the
ground
both
candidates
have
said
the
headswewin
tailsyoulose
pay
schemes
that
seem
all
too
common
in
finance
lie
at
the
heart
of
the
crisis
that
threatens
the
whole
economy
even
some
senior
executives
have
confessed
to
me
that
they
agree
so
many
people
agree
that
the
pay
system
is
broken
it
is
clear
that
rewarding
executives
for
delivering
a
few
quarters
of
outsize
profits
or
a
share
price
that
keeps
rising
until
it
doesnt
only
encourages
those
executives
to
take
risks
and
managing
risks
hasnt
exactly
been
wall
streets
forte
lately
the
question
is
how
should
pay
be
fixed
now
that
american
taxpayers
are
shareholders
in
the
nations
largest
banks
a
bevy
of
plans
is
making
the
rounds
some
in
washington
want
to
cap
pay
period
executive
can
make
only
so
much
and
no
more
others
argue
for
clawbacks
that
is
they
want
executives
who
got
rich
while
their
companies
were
reporting
fat
profits
to
be
forced
to
give
some
of
the
money
back
after
all
much
of
the
industrys
profits
from
the
boom
have
been
vaporized
in
the
bust
and
still
others
have
even
come
up
with
fancy
formulas
to
rein
in
pay
the
issue
has
become
such
a
nailbiter
for
big
banks
that
some
are
even
considering
curbing
pay
voluntarily
top
executives
hope
such
a
move
coming
in
a
year
when
pay
is
already
plummeting
might
quiet
the
rhetoric
it
wont
while
various
plans
are
being
bandied
about
one
in
particular
deserves
attention
it
comes
from
raghuram
g
rajan
a
professor
of
finance
at
the
graduate
school
of
business
at
the
university
of
chicago
and
former
chief
economist
at
the
international
monetary
fund
rajan
is
a
longtime
critic
of
executive
pay
on
wall
street
but
hes
not
a
kneejerk
allbigbonusesarebad
critic
instead
hes
a
pretty
thoughtful
payforperformance
capitalist
who
has
been
studying
ways
to
create
the
right
incentives
for
the
system
to
work
he
has
a
multipronged
approach
that
would
give
banks
a
choice
under
the
first
option
the
government
would
strictly
regulate
compensation
under
the
second
banks
could
pay
their
executives
whatever
they
like

provided
the
banks
set
aside
more
capital
in
other
words
banks
that
cling
to
their
freewheeling
ways
would
have
to
pay
some
sort
of
price
for
rajan
this
is
an
eitheror
proposition
if
banks
pursue
current
compensation
policies

what
might
be
described
as
the
noresponsibility
system
given
the
trouble
were
in

thats
fine
but
if
that
happens
the
government
should
levy
more
capital
requirements
against
the
bank
he
said
requiring
banks
to
have
higher
capital
requirements
would
reduce
the
risk
that
executives
will
make
stupid
decisions
that
imperil
the
firm
and
possibly
the
nations
financial
health
how
much
extra
capital
that
depends
if
banks
spread
out
executives
pay
over
say
four
years
giving
their
executives
an
incentive
to
make
smart
decisions
for
the
long
haul
the
banks
would
be
allowed
to
set
aside
a
bit
less
additional
capital
ditto
if
they
included
clawback
provisions
and
required
executives
to
reinvest
a
substantial
portion
of
their
income
in
their
companies
so
they
had
some
skin
in
the
game
we
need
to
make
people
a
little
more
worried
about
the
future
rajan
said
the
way
things
are
now
executives
are
encouraged
to
take
big
risks
because
they
get
paid
based
on
the
immediate
fees
generated
they
have
little
incentive
to
worry
about
what
might
happen
to
the
balance
sheet
later
rajan
said
he
was
unimpressed
by
efforts
to
pay
executives
partially
in
stock
owning
shares
in
the
entire
company
doesnt
tie
bankers
compensation
directly
to
the
decisions
they
make
within
their
own
units
stock
compensation
doesnt
do
it
because
its
too
broad
he
said
more
important
rajan
wants
executives
to
be
paid
over
a
fouryear
period
receiving
a
fourth
of
their
bonus
income
every
year
if
they
make
a
bad
bet
they
wont
get
paid
the
remaining
amount
and
rajan
thinks
bonuses
should
be
based
strictly
on
what
he
calls
accounting
performance
rather
than
stock
performance
which
he
says
you
cant
control
he
also
wants
chief
executive
pay
to
be
benchmarked
against
the
performance
of
rival
firms
if
a
firms
earnings
are
worse
than
their
rivals
why
should
they
get
a
bonus
he
asked
despite
all
the
criticism
that
hedge
funds
get
for
their
compensation
structures

they
charge
one
fee
up
front
and
take
a
big
cut
of
any
profits

rajan
likes
part
of
the
hedgefund
model
what
is
known
as
a
high
water
mark
when
hedge
fund
managers
lose
their
investors
money
the
managers
dont
collect
any
of
that
fat
incentive
fee
until
they
make
back
the
loss
the
same
rule
should
be
applied
to
bankers
who
destroy
shareholder
value
a
military
panel
at
the
guantanamo
naval
base
convicted
a
former
qaida
propaganda
chief
of
terrorism
charges
on
monday
and
sentenced
him
to
life
in
prison
giving
the
bush
administration
a
second
conviction
in
a
warcrimes
trial
there
but
the
conviction
of
the
detainee
ali
hamza
al
bahlul
was
a
measured
victory
for
the
government
which
has
been
struggling
for
seven
years
to
prove
the
effectiveness
of
its
military
commission
system
for
trying
terrorism
suspects
at
the
us
naval
station
at
guantanamo
bay
cuba
the
guilty
verdict
had
been
expected
because
bahlul
a
yemeni
who
prosecutors
said
was
a
close
aide
to
osama
bin
laden
did
not
offer
any
defense
saying
he
did
not
accept
the
authority
of
the
tribunal
he
insisted
that
his
lawyer
remain
mute
in
a
weeklong
trial
that
drew
little
attention
the
pentagons
response
to
the
verdict
was
muted
al
bahlul
received
a
full
and
fair
trial
said
a
spokesman
cmdr
jeffrey

the
conviction
did
not
appear
likely
to
affect
the
contentious

about
the
use
of

said
glenn
m
sulmasy
a
national
security
law
specialist
at
the
coast
guard
academy
this
was
a
victory
for
the
government
sulmasy
said
but
it
may
not
have
positive
impact
because
of
the
erosion
of
support
and
legitimacy
for

bahlul

moving
quickly
filing

against
nearly
two
dozen
detainees
over
the
last
year
and
expanding
the
staffs
of
military
lawyers
prosecuting
and
defending
the
cases
but
some
lawyers
who
work
on
the
cases
say
the
prosecution
appears
uncertain
because
of
the
possibility
that
the
next
president
will
close
the
guantanamo
detention
center
and
stop
the
trials
even
so
pentagon
officials
have
said
they
are
moving
ahead
with
the
cases
and
anticipate
bringing
many
of
the
detainees
to
trial

the

brig

has
himself
been
at

that
have
slowed
the

several
defense
lawyers
filed

seeking
his
disqualification
claiming
he
was
too
aligned
with

three
military
judges
agreed
disqualifying

from

and
pentagon
officials
said
that
at

two
separate

of
his
conduct
were
under
way
a
spokesman
for
the
general
declined
to
comment
the
history
of
the
tribunals
has
been
rocky
since
president
bush
ordered
military
commission
trials
in
november
2001
the
plan
has
been
stalled
by
court
challenges
and
attacks
from
numerous
military
critics
including
a
former
chief
prosecutor
vandeveld
is
the
latest
former
insider
to
criticize
the
system
publicly
on
monday
he
said
from
his
home
in
pennsylvania
that
he
expected
to
be
called
as
a
witness
by
lawyers
for
numerous
detainees
in
the
meantime
he
said
the
commissions
are
in
such
disarray
and
continue
to
be
in
such
chaos
the
diplomatic
tangle
between
venezuela
argentina
and
the
united
states
reached
a
new
pitch
on
monday
when
a
jury
in
miami
convicted
a
wealthy
venezuelan
businessman
of
acting
as
an
unregistered
agent
of
venezuela
on
american
soil
the
case
known
in
latin
america
as
suitecasegate
started
last
year
with
the
discovery
of
a
mysterious
suitcase
filled
with
800000
in
cash
at
an
airport
here
but
it
has
erupted
into
a
longrunning
scandal
that
has
aggravated
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
its
neighbors
to
the
south
franklin
duran
the
businessman
convicted
monday
went
on
trial
in
miami
for
conspiring
to
cover
up
the
origin
and
destination
of
the
suitcase
it
was
a
secret
contribution
prosecutors
said
sent
by
venezuelas
government
to
bolster
the
campaign
of
argentinas
president
duran
faces
a
maximum
of
15
years
in
prison
the
case
has
become
a
symbol
of
the
antagonism
between
the
bush
administration
and
president
hugo
chavez
of
venezuela
who
has
used
his
nations
oil
wealth
to
spread
his
influence
throughout
the
region
the
scandal
has
also
soured
americas
relations
with
argentina
and
its
president
cristina
fernandez
de
kirchner
whose
legitimacy
has
been
challenged
by
the
revelations
of
secret
campaign
donations
from
outside
her
country
both
chavez
and
kirchner
accused
the
united
states
of
political
motivations
in
bringing
the
case
last
december
a
charge
officials
in
washington
and
miami
have
repeatedly
denied
whether
intentional
or
not
the
eightweek
trial
in
miami
revealed
an
extensive
coverup
effort
by
venezuelan
officials
that
reached
the
highest
levels
of
government
and
laid
bare
a
business
culture
in
venezuela
that
involves
regular
bribes
and
kickbacks
to
high
government
officials
and
members
of
the
military
the
trial
provided
little
in
the
way
of
evidence
that
american
national
security
was
somehow
threatened
by
the
presence
of
the
venezuelans
who
spent
much
of
their
time
on
the
phone
and
in
south
florida
restaurants
trying
to
convince
the
man
caught
with
the
suitcase
guido
alejandro
antonini
wilson
to
keep
the
truth
about
the
money
under
wraps
still
on
monday
american
officials
sought
to
portray
the
investigation
and
trial
as
important
to
safeguarding
national
security
when
unregistered
foreign
agents
believe
that
they
can
operate
on
our
soil
with
impunity
and
disregard
for
us
laws
it
undermines
the
national
security
of
our
country
said
jonathan
i
solomon
the
special
agent
in
charge
of
the
fbis
miami
office
duran
reacted
without
emotion
as
the
verdict
was
read
edward
shohat
his
lawyer
said
he
would
appeal
the
jurys
decision
shohat
referred
to
the
trial
as
a
political
circus
in
which
franklin
duran
is
a
pawn
of
the
us
government
but
the
lawyer
declined
to
comment
on
allegations
he
made
in
the
trials
early
days
that
the
case
was
a
politically
motivated
effort
to
embarrass
chavezs
government
theres
a
lot
of
concern
about
that
but
im
not
going
into
further
details
he
said
the
scandal
surfaced
in
august
2007
when
an
argentine
policewoman
here
became
suspicious
about
a
suitcase
being
rolled
through
customs
by
antonini
wilson
the
policewoman
ordered
him
to
open
the
case
nearly
800000
mostly
in
50
bills
spilled
out
argentine
officials
initially
detained
him
but
let
him
go
after
charging
him
with
a
simple
customs
infraction
an
international
scandal
ensued
when
word
soon
began
leaking
out
that
the
cash
may
have
been
intended
for
kirchner
then
the
leading
candidate
to
succeed
her
husband
nestor
kirchner
as
president
of
argentina
by
that
time
antonini
wilson
was
long
gone
having
hopped
a
plane
back
to
miami
a
secret
coverup
followed
prosecutors
said
directed
from
venezuela
and
reaching
up
to
chavez
himself
who
assigned
his
intelligence
chief
to
try
to
keep
antonini
wilson
silent
according
to
testimony
from
witnesses
unbeknownst
to
the
governments
of
venezuela
and
argentina
antonini
wilson
had
gone
to
the
fbi
just
days
after
arriving
back
in
florida
he
subsequently
recorded
hundreds
of
hours
of
conversations
between
himself
and
the
venezuelans
three
venezuelans
and
an
uruguayan
were
arrested
including
duran
a
longtime
friend
and
business
acquaintance
of
antonini
wilson
at
secretly
recorded

duran
offered
to
deliver
up

atlarge
three
of
the
four
men
who
were
arrested
pleaded
guilty
to
the

charges
duran
was

and
two
of
them
were
among
the
governments
star
witnesses
carlos
kauffmann
a
longtime
friend
and
business
partner
of
duran
testified
that
he
and
duran
were
driven
to
help
the
venezuelan
government
by
the
promise
of
more
lucrative
government
deals
he
said
he
and
duran
regularly
paid
kickbacks
to
venezuelan
government
agencies
and
state
officials
that
netted
the
two
men
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
bigtime
favors
sir
he
testified
when
asked
what
he
expected
to
get
from
the
venezuelan
government
for
the
effort
to
keep
antonini
wilson
from
talking
if
we
needed
more
contracts
for
our
companies
we
would
make
sure
we
were
going
to
receive
them
kauffmann
also
testified
that
the
argentine
and
venezuelan
governments
were
working
together
to
ensure
that
an
argentine
probe
into
the
origin
of
the
suitcase
was
unsuccessful
both
governments
had
agreed
to
work
this
problem
out
kauffmann
said
when
antonini
wilson
took
the
stand
saying
that
the
suitcase
was
not
his

testified
that
he
was
told
an

to
argentina
and
he
said
there
had
been
previous
operations
to
smuggle

to
other

sharna

they
married
in
a
daze
in

they
married
on
an

on
monday
when
it
really
counted
under

years
and
through
two
previous
samesex
marriage
ceremonies
neither
recognized
as
legal
i
mean
trust
me
we
feel
married
but
this
is
a
legal
response
they
were
not
alone
with
polls
showing
the
outcome
of
a
ballot
measure
tuesday
on
outlawing
samesex
marriage
in
california
a
tossup

version
of
a
shotgun
wedding
said
duran
were
doing
as
many
as
we
can
before
tomorrow
the
rush
to
the
altar
was
in
anticipation
of
proposition
8
which
would
amend
the
state
constitution
to
define
marriage
as
between
a
man
and
a
woman
and
end
nearly
five
months
of
legalized
samesex
marriages
in
the
state
the

if
approved
would
take
effect
wednesday
were
here

really
close
samesex
couples
filled
the

in
several
other
california

reported
a
surge
in
the
issuance
of

licenses
with
some
offices
booked
to

san
francisco
expects
to
have
performed
more
than
1100
samesex
ceremonies
in
the
two
weeks
leading
up
to
election
day
elsewhere
newlyweds
held
ceremonies
on
beachfronts
backyards
and
living
rooms
we
kind
of
said
proposition
8
was
like
our
version
of
getting
knocked
up
said
benjamin
pither
28
who
married
his
highschool
sweetheart
joseph
greaves
on
sunday
at
greaves
parents
house
in
santa
rosa
calif
we
both
liked
the
idea
of
marriage
but
we
wanted
to
do
it
in
our
own
time
but
when
it
looked
like
proposition
8
might
pass
we
realized
that
we
would
regret
it
if
we
didnt
take
the
opportunity
some
couples
traveled
from
afar
to
make
monday
the
big
day
allison
and
rose
a
couple
from
tampa
bay
fla
said
they
had
come
to
san
francisco
to
marry
on
the
advice
of
friends
who
suspect
that
florida
will
pass
its
own
constitutional
ban
on
samesex
marriage
on
tuesday
the
couple
who
said
they
might
relocate
if
florida
passes
its
ban
did
not
want
their
last
names
used
because
fears
that
they
would
be
discriminated
against
at
home
it
isnt
like
san
francisco
rose
said
while
defeat
of
the
california
ballot
measure
would
probably
quell
debate

at
least
for
a
time

over
allowing
samesex
unions
in
the
state
it
is
expected
that
a
victory
would
lead
to
a
secondround
of
legal
wrangling
this
time
over
the
validity
of
the
thousands
marriages
performed
since
june
when
a
state
supreme
court
decision
legalizing
samesex
marriages
took
effect
the
california
attorney
general
jerry
brown
has
indicated
that
he
would
uphold
the
marriages
but
geoff
kors
the
executive
director
of
equality
california
a
gay
rights
group
opposing
proposition
8
said
he
expects
challenges
if
they
lose
it
wouldnt
surprise
me
that
people
trying
to
eliminate
constitutional
rights
would
try
to
annul
or
divorce
people
that
are
married
said
kors
who
nonetheless
expressed
optimism
that
the
ballot
measure
would
fail
supporters
of
the
ban
say
no
rights
would
be
infringed
by
its
passage
but
suggest
the
california
supreme
court
would
have
to
deal
with
the
mess
that
it
made
by
allowing
the
marriages
in
the
first
place
said
sonja
eddings
brown
a
spokeswoman
for
protect
marriage
the
leading
group
behind
proposition
8
in
the
spring
opponents
of
samesex
marriage
had
asked
the
court
to
put
off
the
marriages
until
the
results
of
tuesdays
election
were
known
but
the
request
was
turned
down
they
knew
proposition
8
was
going
to
be
on
the
ballot
and
they
decided
not
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
the
people
brown
said
each
side
has
poured
more
than
25
million
into
the
fight
over
the
ballot
measure
making
it
one
of
the
most
expensive
measures
ever
in
a
state
known
for
its
proclivities
for
direct
democracy
airwaves
across
the
state
have
been
blanketed
in
recent
weeks
with
increasingly
overheated
advertisements
with
opponents
likening
the
proposition
to
the
jailing
of
japanese
citizens
during
world
war
ii
and
supporters
suggesting
that
samesex
marriage
will
be
taught
to
young
schoolchildren
the
most
recent
field
poll
showed
a
5
point
advantage
for
opponents
of
the
measure
but
supporters
of
proposition
8
say
samesex
marriage
bans
across
the
country
have
been
traditionally
understated
in
the
polls
in
2000
when
california
voters
approved
a
law
defining
marriage
as
between
a
man
and
woman
a
field
poll
just
before
the
election
showed
that
53
percent
of
those
polled
approved
the
measure
the
final
tally
in
favor
of
the
law
was
61
percent
the
2000
law
was
overturned
in
may
by
the
state
supreme
court
hundreds
of
joyous
couples
were
married
on
balconies
and
atriums
throughout
the
citys
soaring
city
hall
when
the
courts
ruling
took
effect
on
june
16
2008
the
mood
was
more
subdued
on
monday
with
bureaucracy

next
please

replacing
much
of
the
ebullience
of
that
day
fey
and
broadbeck
for
example
seemed
to
almost
have
a
touch
of
samesexmarriage
fatigue
the
couple
was
among
the
4000
that
married
in
a
happy
haze
in
2004
in
san
francisco
after
the
citys
mayor
gavin
newsom
suddenly
ordered
the
city
clerk
to
marry
samesex
couples
all
those
marriages
were
later
invalidated
by
the
courts
a
year
later
the
couple
married
again
in
hawaii
but
it
was
an
unofficial
ceremony
in
a
state
that
does
not
allow
samesex
marriage
so
it
was
that
this
time
around
they
had
almost
forgotten
to
tie
the
knot
all
summer
long
we
were
like
oh
yeah
we
should
do
that
said
fey
and
then
all
of
the
sudden
it
was
like
uh
oh
paul
ellis
51
a
retail
manager
in
san
francisco
was
at
city
hall
on
monday
to
witness
golden
and
levys
wedding
it
was
his
seventh
samesex
marriage
in
the
last
five
months
he
said
most
of
them
in
the
tartan
kilt
that
he
wore
on
a
muggy
monday
in
san
francisco
a
wardrobe
choice
he
regretted
you
wouldnt
want
to
wrap
six
yards
of
cloth
around
your
hips
on
a
day
like
this
he
said
ellis
had
also
taken
matters
in
his
own
hands
getting
an
online
certification
as
a
marriage
officiate
and
presiding
over
two
ceremonies
for
other
gay
friends

all
ahead
of
tuesdays
election
at
this
point
he
said
of
the
ballot
measures
fate
i
think
its
a
complete
crapshoot
it
would
be
nice
to
think
that
if
george
bailey
had
been
around
in
september
the
us
government
could
have
saved
itself
700
billion
iceland
could
have
averted
near
bankruptcy
and
the
rest
of
the
world
could
have
avoided
another
trillion
dollars
in
bailouts
and
the
prospect
of
a
deep
and
long
recession
you
recall
george
in
the
person
of
james
stewart
he
stopped
a
run
on
the
bailey
brothers
building
ampamp
loan
association
that
would
have
destroyed
it
in
the
film
its
a
wonderful
life
his
predicament
with
its
eerie
prefigurement
of
the
present
provokes
a
closer
look
at
the
crossroads
in
which
culture
and
finance
intersect
in
the
film
the
building
ampamp
loan
faces
what
is
now
called
a
liquidity
crisis

the
association
could
not
possibly
cover
its
obligations
with
available
cash
let
alone
guarantee
any
loans
the
townspeople
rush
in
demanding
their
life
savings
youre
thinking
of
this
place
all
wrong
george
tells
the
crowd
as
if
i
had
the
money
back
in
a
safe
the
moneys
not
here
that
much
was
obvious
but
george
goes
on
pointing
to
individuals
your
moneys
in
joes
house
he
says
to
one
man
right
next
to
yours
he
says
to
another
and
in
the
kennedy
house
and
mrs
backlins
house
and
a
hundred
others
why
youre
lending
them
the
money
to
build
and
then
theyre
going
to
pay
it
back
to
you
as
best
they
can
you
think
you
are
just
depositing
your
money
here
he
suggests
but
actually
were
all
helping
one
another
and
if
some
homeowners
cant
meet
their
payments
what
are
you
going
to
do
george
asks
foreclose
on
them
weve
got
to
stick
together
george
says
or
the
truly
evil
banker
henry
potter
will
gain
control
of
everything
weve
got
to
have
faith
in
each
other
and
at
least
for
a
while
the
pitch
works
georges
view
of
the
savings
and
loan
as
a
form
of
social
welfare
institution
was
learned
at
the
feet
of
his
father
who
built
that
savings
and
loan
telling
him
its
deep
in
the
race
for
a
man
to
want
his
own
roof
and
walls
and
fireplace
and
were
helping
him
get
those
things
the
baileys
could
almost
be
early
incarnations
of
fannie
mae
and
freddie
mac

governmentcreated
companies
established
to
help
make
that
same
dream
possible
among
american
citizens
beginning
in
the
mid1990s
they
were
steadily
pressured
by
politicians
and
the
public
to
guarantee
loans
to
ever
more
risky
borrowers
in
the
name
of
this
very
ideal
what
really
helped
that
project
along
though
was
the
discovery
on
wall
street
that
such
risky
loans
could
be
bundled
with
others
like
some
multipack
at
costco
and
resold
as
highly
rated
securities
it
is
as
if
george
had
found
a
way
to
go
into
business
with
potter
answering
his
scornful
challenge
are
you
running
a
business
or
a
charity
ward
with
both
as
it
has
turned
out
of
course
both
georges
charitable
dream
in
which
banks
would
cuddle
with
their
communities
and
avoid
foreclosures
and
potters
dream
of
profittaking
maneuverings
unhampered
by
other
considerations
collapsed
under
the
unrealistic
weight
of
their
fantasies
a
few
weeks
ago
but
in
the
midst
of
this
crisis
something
else
has
been
revealed
that
we
ordinarily
associate
more
with
cultural
life
than
with
financial
enterprise
in
the
wake
of
foreclosures
and
bank
failures
all
circulation
trade
interaction

the
intercourse
of
economic
life

had
nearly
ground
to
a
halt
even
if
a
bank
had
money
it
was
not
about
to
risk
lending
it
even
for
shortterm
use
by
reputable
businesses
it
is
as
if
the
entire
standard
of
valuation
had
been
shattered
what
was
anything
really
worth
what
was
dangerous
and
what
was
safe
who
could
be
relied
on
so
debased
had
judgment
become
and
so
unpredictable
were
the
consequences
that
the
safest
thing
to
do
was
absolutely
nothing
liquidity
turned
solid
credit
froze
and
this
reflected
a
collapse
not
just
of
business
activity
but
also
of
trust
or
to
use
georges
word
of
faith
it
might
seem
strange
to
think
of
these
enormous
disruptions
as
reflections
of
something
so
elemental
trillions
of
dollars
are
now
being
expended
to
reestablish
trust
but
we
can
see
how
this
issue
came
up
in
earlier
periods
of
cultural
transition
consider
shakespeares
merchant
of
venice
written
at
a
time
when
elizabethan
england
was
being
transformed
by
european
trade
and
its
own
growing
international
ambitions
the
play
can
even
seem
to
be
about
how
to
create
trust
in
a
tumultuous
marketplace
the
play
lampoons
cultural
differences
in
cosmopolitan
venice
a
buffoonish
spaniard
a
scimitarwielding
moroccan
drunken
germans
a
jewish
usurer

these
types
are
all
invoked
in
the
work
but
how
are
such
varied
figures
to
interact
in
the
trade
and
profit
of
the
city
only
through
the
presence
of
a
strong
central
law
that
would
guarantee
trust
in
the
midst
of
distrust
shakespeare
though
does
not
minimize
the
difficulties
in
creating
consistent
methods
for
judging
whether
assessing
products
or
the
people
who
make
them
are
the
goods
what
they
seem
are
people
portias
suitors
are
forced
to
choose
a
gold
silver
or
lead
casket

uncertain
about
which
will
disclose
the
true
image
of
their
beloved
characters
confuse
lies
and
truth
ornament
and
essence
mercy
and
ruthlessness
in
the
midst
of
all
this
it
is
amazing
that
any
kind
of
social
and
economic
interchange
is
possible
shakespeare
seems
to
be
asserting
it
is
but
with
modern
eyes
wary
of
his
treatment
of
shylock
we
wonder
on
the
brink
of
the
modern
economic
world
the
issues
become
even
more
fraught
anthony
trollope
said
that
his
1875
novel
the
way
we
live
now
was
instigated
by
what
i
conceived
to
be
the
commercial
profligacy
of
the
age
but
that
profligacy
was
also
a
reflection
of
a
social
transformation
the
traditional
social
order
could
no
longer
be
counted
on
the
hierarchy
of
english
society
ceased
to
be
a
hierarchy
of
worth
financial
or
otherwise
lords
with
enormous
estates
could
be
broke
ious
could
casually
be
exchanged
backed
by
nothing
but
the
vague
whiff
of
respectability
and
title
the
central
figure
an
arriviste
financier
creates
a
pyramid
scheme
in
which
railroads
of
the
new
world
figure
prominently
trollope
sees
a
world
of
social
dissolution
matching
the
financial
dissolution
appearance
bears
no
relationship
to
reality
by
the
novels
end
trollope
suggests
the
only
hope
for
a
restoration
of
trust
is
a
retreat
from
the
new
commercial
age
trollope
was
not
alone
in
harley
granvillebarkers
1905
play
the
voysey
inheritance
the
main
tradition
in
a
distinguished
family
investment
firm
is
the
fraudulent
bilking
of
its
clients
a
heritage
in
which
trust
is
hypocritically
cultivated
and
now
of
course
the
issue
of
trust
is
elevated
to
an
unprecedented
scale
in
2007
when
the
failures
of
this
autumn
were
scarcely
imagined
the
investment
analyst
james
grant
predicted
that
the
habits
of
the
preceding
years
would
lead
to
an
imminent
collapse
of
credit
over
which
posterity
will
shake
its
head
muttering
what
were
they
thinking

he
argued
that
the
ornate
nature
of
the
financial
products
being
packaged
was
part
of
the
problem
and
in
an
oped
article
in
the
new
york
times
this
past
january
agreed
with
the
global
bank
ubs
which
called
the
current
mortgage
crisis
the
biggest
failure
of
ratings
and
risk
management
ever
what
is
strange
is
that
we
now
depend
on
the
state
to
reestablish
trust
by
rescuing
and
even
nationalizing
financial
institutions
relying
on
the
same
authority
that
gives
paper
money
its
value
but
after
the
events
of
the
last
century
can
anyone
fully
believe
that
the
state
should
be
the
ultimate
standard
for
trust
and
fiscal
faith
and
would
even
a
reallife
george
bailey
be
able
to
coax
us
into
confidence
let
alone

that
good
intentions
have
power
over

on

that
it

the

sacrificed

then
they

its
a

mark

the

vice
president
of

operations
said
at
the
time
chess
is
a
tougher
game
to
understand
and
youve
got
to
wait
longer
to
see
the
results
of
the
move
now
the
boldest
move
of
all
allen
iverson
for
chauncey
billups
the
results
of
those
chess
moves
will
lead
to
victory
or
defeat
but
not
a
draw
i
give
high
praise

honestly
the

to

without

carmelo

chauncey
billups
jr
smith
kenyon
martin
nene
except
that
might
not
be
the
starting
five
according
to
coach
george
karl
who
is
not
a
nuggets
vice
president
or
boris
spassky
karl
said
after
practice
that
he
might
start
dahntay
jones
at
shooting
guard
or
use
anthony
carter
in
the
starting
lineup
with
billups
and
he
might
keep
bringing
smith
off
the
bench
or
or

the
chess
moves
arent
finished
antonio
mcdyess
will
not
have
a
homecoming
with
billups
although
the
nuggets
kept
talking
monday
about
mcdyess
future
with
the
team
there
will
be
none
his
contract
will
be
bought
out
and
he
probably
will
resign
with
detroit
huh
he
was
included
in
the
deal
to
make
the
salary
numbers
equitable
in
regard
to
the
third
guy
in
the
deal
cheikh
samb
i
thought
i
must
be
totally
stupid
because
i
had
never
heard
of
him
but
neither
had
most
of
the
nuggets
and
nobody
seem
to
know
what
continent
he
is
from
africa
it
turns
out
the
7foot1
center
will
not
stick
with
the
nuggets
juwan
howard
who
was
waived
on
monday
will
be
resigned
by
the
nuggets
and
who
knows
what
will
happen
to
chucky
atkins
and
steven
hunter
who
have
been
injured
noncontributors
the
nuggets
probably
wish
hunter
would
retire
and
probably
wish
they
could
trade
atkins
the
nuggets
are
still
owned
by
stan
kroenke
but
they
belong
to
anthony
this
is
now
anthonys
team
and
he
must
show
he
can
finally
take
control
of
his
career
with
an
assist
literally
from
billups
billups
is
one
of
our
own
the
most
famous
modernday
basketball
player
of
denver
roots
he
left
twice
as
a
young
man
became
the
main
man
in
detroit
and
returns
as
the
learned
man
billups
can
do
for
the
denver
nuggets
what
he
did
for
denvers
george
washington
high
school
and
the
university
of
colorado

help
lead
them
to
victories
in
the
postseason
he
is
a
winner
if
you
dont
like
chaunceys
comeback
you
never
cared
for
dickensian
characters
billups
provides
the
nuggets
with
upstanding
character
class
leadership
an
nbachampionship
and
finals
mvp
background
one
of
the
best
point
guards
in
the
game
a
player
unafraid
to
take
and
make
the
last
big
shot
mr
big
shot
is
his
nickname
toughness
exceptional
defense
and
tremendous
basketball
knowledge
and
awareness
it
will
be
said
by
some
in
detroit
and
denver
that
chauncey
is
shopworn
too
slow
too
old
but
they
dont
understand
he
is
too
too
good
ive
watched
billups
when
he
was
an
eighth
grader
in
the
colorado
state
tournament
at
his
high
school
graduation
in
the
ncaa
tournament
when
he
was
with
the
nuggets
before
and
in
the
2004
nba
finals
as
i
sat
in
a
tiki
hut
bar
on
a
beach
ive
talked
with
chauncey
when
he
signed
his
scholarship
with
colorado
after
he
was
drafted
in
the
first
round
at
a
denver
broncos
practice
this
year
and
during
charity
events
in
denver
chauncey
belongs
with
the
nuggets
allen
iverson
is
the
answer
but
chauncey
billups
is
the
answer
not
the
tires
the
nuggets
kicked
such
as
stephon
marbury
or
jamaal
tinsley
or
anthony
carter
no
matter
the
end
game
of
royal
gambit
the
nuggets
vice
presidents
got
this
chess
move
right
pundits
and
pollsters
may
be
trying
to
take
all
the
fun
out
of
election
day
so
many
have
predicted
a
lopsided
victory
for
sen
barack
obama
over
sen
john
mccain
that
you
might
wonder
why
even
to
bother
watching
the
returns
on
tuesday
night
the
fact
is
there
is
plenty
of
mystery

and
there
is
only
one
poll
that
counts
aim
to
have
the
popcorn
popped
and
to
be
on
the
couch
no
later
than
7
pm
eastern
time
thats
assuming
you
have
a
day
job
and
have
not
been
glued
to
the
television
all
day
of
course
even
if
you
have
a
day
job
you
may
have
been
glued
to
the
web
in
which
case
take
a
quick
break
now
a
guide
of
highlights
to
watch
for
on
tuesday
setting
the
table
the
networks
are
not
supposed
to
call
a
state
until
all
the
polls
in
that
state
have
closed
but
there
will
be
lots
of
raw
data
online
so
you
can
go
on
the
web
check
the
returns
and
try
calling
the
state
yourself
several
news
sites
include
interactive
maps
so
you
can
play
along
at
home
to
see
how
the
candidates
might
reach
270
electoral
votes
the
magic
number
needed
to
claim
the
presidency
and
theyre
off
the
suspense
starts
in
indiana
most
polls
close
at
6
pm
and
others
at
7
pm
indiana
is
a
ruby
red
state
where
obama
has
been
running
closely
with
mccain
be
wary
of
results
that
do
not
include
gary
a
city
with
a
substantial
africanamerican
population
if
obama
wins
it
indiana
could
be
the
canary
in
the
coal
mine
predicting
disaster
ahead
for
mccain
aperitif
also
at
7
pm
polls
close
in
virginia
and
georgia
and
polls
close
in
most
of
florida
and
new
hampshire
all
eyes
will
quickly
veer
to
virginia
which
obama
has
labored
to
win
if
he
succeeds
in
the
former
capital
of
the
onetime
confederacy
he
will
most
likely
do
exceedingly
well
the
rest
of
the
night
subtracting
virginia
from
the
republican
column
would
give
mccain
very
few
routes
to
270
electoral
votes
new
hampshire
is
less
predictive
but
it
would
be
a
bad
sign
for
mccain
if
he
cannot
capture
these
mavericks
whom
he
has
been
courting
for
eight
years
orange
crush
florida
a
voting
experience
unto
itself
whoever
wins
florida
the
fourthlargest
state
gets
a
big
leg
up
on
winning
the
presidency
again
if
mccain
loses
here
his
path
narrows
but
the
race
is
so
close
that
florida
may
not
portend
much
about
the
rest
of
the
country
the
drama
in
this
state
which
has
become
synonymous
with
electoral
dysfunction
may
be
in
the
new
and
creative
ways
in
which
voters
might
be
foiled
from
casting
their
ballots
palate
cleansers
at
730
pm
polls
close
in
ohio
and
north
carolina
while
ohio
is
the
bigger
prize
keep
your
eyes
on
north
carolina
where
officials
have
the
option
of
keeping
the
polls
open
until
830
pm
if
there
are
problems
north
carolina
is
a
red
state
that
is
newly
competitive
again
thanks
to
an
obama
ground
organization
if
north
carolina
votes
for
obama
the
map
is
likely
to
bleed
blue
for
the
rest
of
the
night
as
for
ohio
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
adage
still
applies
that
no
republican
has
won
the
presidency
without
carrying
ohio
since
abraham
lincoln
for
an
indication
of
how
things
are
going
check
the
returns
from
stark
county
a
longtime
bellwether
main
course
at
8
pm
pennsylvania
and
missouri
finish
voting
pennsylvania
of
course
is
the
keystone
to
mccains
survival
strategy
it
is
the
one
big
blue
state
where
he
has
staked
his
claim
in
anticipation
of
losing
some
smaller
red
states
if
he
wins
pennsylvania
it
would
keep
mccain
alive
and
scramble
the
picture
for
obama
and
it
would
lead
to
grave
pronouncements
about
racism
and
the
socalled
bradley
effect
of
whites
not
being
honest
about
their
preferences
to
pollsters
surveys
of
voters
leaving
the
polls
in
the
april
primary
found
that
19
percent
said
that
race
played
an
important
role
in
their
decision
as
they
delivered
the
state
to
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
by
nine
percentage
points
over
obama
missouri
is
another
red
state
where
the
contest
looks
close
but
it
frequently
has
voting
problems
that
delay
the
count
so
dont
expect
right
away
to
add
this
to
one
column
or
the
other
when
you
do
get
the
results
missouri
is
usually
with
the
winner
go
west
colorado
polls
close
at
9
pm
this
is
a
tossup
that
has
been
trending
democratic
and
is
now
leaning
obama
if
he
wins
here
watch
for
chatter
of
a
democratic
realignment
early
voting
was
big
here

an
astounding
46
percent
of
voters
cast
their
ballots
before
election
day
the
call
conventional
wisdom
suggests
that
if
obama
wins
he
would
do
so
early
because
the
polls
in
so
many
tossup
states

indiana
north
carolina
ohio
and
florida

close
early
long
lines
or
problems
could
delay
the
count
watch
to
see
how
skittish
or
not
the
networks
are
about
calling
the
states
and
the
final
outcome
cbs
has
signaled
it
might
project
a
preliminary
winner
at
8
pm
but
all
news
organizations
have
nightmares
about
the
debacle
in
2000
when
most
made
the
wrong
calls
a
twoscreen
night
this
is
the
first
presidential
election
in
which
the
web
will
be
a
major
source
of
live
information
this
puts
even
more
pressure
on
the
networks
to
remind
viewers
of
their
resources
and
heft

and
to
offer
something
different
check
out
the
holograms
on
cnn
the
networks
are
offering
more
bells
and
whistles
this
year
but
they
are
competing
with
their
cable
channels
and
their
own
web
sites
as
well
as
those
of
other
news
outlets
including
nytimescom
a
note
of
caution
if
a
network
calls
a
state
you
might
be
able
to
extrapolate
something
but
if
a
network
does
not
call
a
state
dont
read
too
much
into
it
it
may
be
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
exit
polls
anyone
remember
president
john
kerry
in
2004
no
more
chads
expect
some
confusion
at
the
polls
about
half
of
all
voters
will
cast
their
ballots
differently
from
the
way
they
cast
them
in
the
last
presidential
election
most
will
use
paper
ballots
rather
than
those
touchy
touchscreen
machines
still
heavy
voter
participation
could
delay
poll
closings
and
stall
the
counting
turnout
based
on
early
voting
analysts
are
predicting
there
they
go
again
that
more
people
will
probably
vote
this
year
than
ever
in
terms
of
numbers
and
maybe
at
a
higher
rate
the
rate
to
beat
in
modern
times
is
the
64
percent
who
voted
in
1960
but
the
real
record
was
set
a
century
ago
when
66
percent
voted
in
a
race
that
no
doubt
warms
the
heart
of
mccain
1908
was
the
year
that
william

perhaps
their
greatest
disappointment
is
over
their

are
focused
not

that

dire
gm

already
lost
188

in
the
first

of

took

the

in

according
to

laneve
gms
sales
chief
for

added
in
my
27
years
in
the

i
have
never
seen
a

like
this
gms
chairman
rick
wagoner
has
been
leading
the
efforts
by
detroit
to
get
some
sort
of
financial
aid
package
from
washington
so
far
he
has
been
unable
to
persuade
the
bush
administration
to
provide
direct
loans
to
the
companies
or
inject
capital
into
their
autofinance
arms
there
was
no
immediate
comment
monday
from

officials
on
whether
the
dismal
october
sales
might
free
up
aid
from
the
700
billion
rescue
fund
for
financial
institutions
gm
officials
said
the
october
sales
rate
was
in
its
estimation
the
worst
of
the
postworld
war
ii
era
given
the
nations
population
growth
since
the
1940s
the
companys
top
market
analyst
michael
digiovanni
said
the
lack
of
financing
for
automotive
lenders
is
driving
sales
down
to
a
severe
recessionary
level
at
this
juncture
in
us
automotive
history
its
highly
critical
for
the
government
and
the
banks
to
help
us
he
said
officials
at
other
automakers
said
the
downturn
will
probably
continue
into
next
year
we
would
not
expect
that
we
are
at
the
bottom
yet
said
emily
kolinski
morris
fords
senior
economist
laneve
and
other
auto
executives
said
the
companies
would
probably
start
their
traditional
yearend
sales
programs
much
earlier
than
usual
but
cash
offers
to
customers
will
not
make
up
for
the
lack
of
available
credit
laneve
said
that
about
half
of
gms
45
percent
sales
decline
in
october
could
be
attributed
to
people
simply
unable
to
get
a
car
loan
even
automakers
that
have
been
offering
big
discounts
stumbled
badly
in
october
toyota
for
example
has
been
providing
zero
percent
financing
on
the
bulk
of
its
lineup
for
a
month
yet
still
saw
its
sales
tumble
23
percent
buyers
are
in
the
drivers
seat
in
a
market
thats
awash
with
good
deals
strong
values
and
new
products
said
bob
carter
general
manager
of
the
companys
toyota
division
another
toyota
executive
irv
miller
said
the
industry
hopes
that
tuesdays
presidential
election
might
remove
some
of
the
uncertainty
that
consumers
are
feeling
about
the
economy
anything
right
now
that
takes
any
element
of
uncertainty
out
of
the
marketplace
we
think
will
be
beneficial
said
miller
besides
a
new
round
of
incentives
for
consumers
the
october
results
will
probably
prompt
automakers
to
make
more
production
cuts
and
lay
off
additional
factory
workers
both
gm
and
ford
will
release
their
thirdquarter
earnings
later
this
week
and
are
expected
to
report
huge
losses
for
the
quarter
as
part
of
the
announcements
both
companies
will
probably
reveal
plans
to
further
reduce
production
at
their
north
american
plants
but
unlike
previous
cuts
the
reductions
might
not
be
limited
to
gasguzzling
suvs

slowselling

there
are
no

to

also
that

the

his
latest
quest
the
supreme
court
agreed
monday
to
decide
whether
people
convicted
of
crimes
have
a
constitutional
right
to
test
dna
evidence
that
could
prove
their
innocence

long
after
trials
and
appeals
are
concluded
in
april
the
9th
us
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
san
francisco
ordered
prosecutors
in
alaska
to
turn
over
dna
evidence
that
had
been
used
to
convict
william
g
osborne
of
kidnapping
and
raping
a
prostitute
the
appeals
court
said
that
biological
evidence

hairs
and
semen

could
be
subjected
to
more
sophisticated
dna
testing
than
had
been
used
by
the
prosecution
to
implicate

said
the
appeals
court
had
created
from
whole
cloth
a
constitutional
right
of
postconviction
access
to
dna
evidence
the
prosecutors
added
that
the
court
had
made
a
separate
mistake
in
allowing
a
right
of
access
to
be
pursued
even
if
a
conviction
was
not
being
challenged
in
a
pending
case
the
federal
government
and
44
states

but
not
alaska

have
laws
allowing
postconviction
dna
testing
osborne
was
convicted
in
1994
based
in
part
on
dna
evidence
that
had
been
subjected
to
relatively
unsophisticated
testing
it
indicated
that
biological
evidence
in
the
case
had
characteristics
consistent
with
the
profiles
of
15
percent
of
africanamerican
men
including
osborne
his
lawyer
decided
not
to
pursue
more
discriminating
testing
fearing
that
it
might
further
incriminate
his
client
osborne
was
sentenced
to
26
years
in
prison
with
five
years
suspended
he
later
confessed
to
the
alaska
board
of
parole
but
has
since
said
he
did
so
only
in
the
hope
of
quicker
release
the
supreme
court
has
in
earlier
cases
left
open
the
question
of
whether
people
convicted
after
fair
trials
may
nonetheless
file
federal
claims
based
solely
on
evidence
that
they
are
in
fact
innocent
barry
scheck
a
director
of
the
innocence
project
at
cardozo
school
of
law
which
represents
osborne
said
he
could
not
understand
why
prosecutors
in
alaska
have
opposed
testing
the
state
of
alaska
concedes
that
dna
testing
could
prove
william
osbornes
innocence
while
fighting
his
right
to
testing
scheck
said
why
would
anyone
be
afraid
to
learn
the
truth
in
this
case
there
is
no
rational
reason
to
deny
dna
testing
that
could
prove
innocence
or
confirm
guilt
biennials
are
a
virus
that
has
spread
across
the
globe
embraced
by
cities
as
tourist
magnets
and
branding
tools
they
often
seem
to
be
stocked
by
a
standard
jet
set
of
curators
artists
collectors
and
advisers
who
touch
down
in
slightly
different
configurations
at
nearly
every
stop
new
orleans
has
joined
the
biennial
rush
with
prospect1
the
sprawling
exhibition
that
opened
across
the
city
over
the
weekend
with
a
roster
of
nearly
80
artists
this
show
has
an
unsurprising
mix
of
good
bad
and
phonedin
art
but
it
is
also
a
testing
ground
with
little
in
the
way
of
way
of
superstars
big
curatorial
egos
and
elaborately
produced
works
and
none
of
the
vast
chilling
art
halls
endemic
in
biennials
it
proves
that
biennials
can
be
just
as
effective
when
pulled
off
without
bells
whistles
big
bucks
and
the
usual
suspects
maybe
even
more
effective
especially
if
the
local
cultural
soil
is
spectacularly
fertile
and
if
theres
a
citywide
need
for
uplift
under
these
conditions
something
magical
can
happen
a
merging
of
art
and
city
into
a
shifting
healing
kaleidoscope
sometimes
this
occurs
in
works
that
are
unrelated
to
new
orleans
like
the
glittery
wall
hangings
el
anatsui
fashions
from
the
foil
of
liquor
bottles
or
yasumasa
morimuras
ranting
riveting
video
performance
as
a
series
of
20thcentury
dictators
sometimes
it
occurs
in
sitespecific
works
like
nari

sculpture
of
a
giant
gem
filled
with
weightlifting
machines

a
veteran
curator

the
founder
of

came
to
new
orleans
after
hurricane
katrina
and
didnt
want
to
leave
he
seems
to
have
sensed
that
in
the
citys
rawness
a
different
kind
of
biennial
was
waiting
to
break
free
because
new
orleans
lacked
an
obvious
site
for
the
event
or
the
means
to
build
one
cameron
has
distributed
his
selections
in
about
30
locations
several
museums
and
alternative
spaces
as
well
as
public
buildings
old
houses
and
empty
lots
stripped
bare
by
the
hurricane
as
a
result
you
are
rarely
viewing
artworks
in
isolation
but
rather
measuring
them
against
their
contexts
on
one
level
the
show
is
a
lively
competition
between
socalled
sitespecific
art
and
portable
art
objects
whose
meanings
are
expanded
by
their
settings
on
another
it
is
a
tour
of
the
citys
rich
past
recent
trauma
and
often
struggling
arts
organizations
and
it
didnt
hurt
that
prospect1
opened
the
weekend
before
the
presidential
election
with
everybody
on
pins
and
needles
again
and
again

indians
as
well
as
a
practicing
shaman
profuse
with
hallucinatory
patterns
and
colors
and
evocations
of
african
masks
his

derail
any
closed
definition
of

as
does
seeing

them
in

on

and
in

made
at
the
rate
of

and

the

are
worn
whenever
the
occasion
demands
that
harris
call
forth
a
spirit
he
has
named
fiyiyi
the
garments
leave
no
doubt
about
the
high
levels
of
creativity
in
a
city
where
french
french
canadian
african
and
american

cultures
have
mixed
for

has
painted
the

with
lavish
slightly
oppressive
vistas
of

swamps
exaggerating
the
traditions
of

and

painting
to
suggest
that

is
ever
invasive
and
always
capable
of

provides
a

of
the
eradication
in
the

where
nothing
remains
of
many
houses
except
lonely
stoops
and
empty
lots
made
of
old
pieces
of
posterplastered

the
ark
rises
from
one
of
these
lots
forlorn
yet
indomitable
its
ancient
hulk
with
its
cacophony
of
decaying
advertisements
seems
to
ridicule
the
overwrought
seemingly
marooned
houses
commissioned
by
the
actor
brad

that
dot
the

sometimes
touring
the
show
you
can
see
hints
of
the

possible
comeback
to
reach
the

photos
by
the
french
artists
pierre
et
gilles
in
a
building
that
was
a

store
before

you
must
walk
through
a
lively
exhibition
of
work
by
local
artists

one
of
several
shows
piggybacking
on
prospect1

as
well
as
the
front
desk
of
a
police
precinct
there
are
some
unfortunate
miscalculations
the
talented
katharina
grosse
has
sprayed
orange
and
yellow
paint
all
over
the
facade
and
front
yard
of
a
dilapidated
house
in
the
lower
ninth
it
may
be
intended
to
symbolize
the
fire
next
time
but
it
seems
to
humiliate
one
of
the
storms
survivors
the
effect
is
more
organic
in
a
doublescreen
video
by
the
brazilian
artist
rosangela
renno
which
can
be
seen
in
the
french
quarter
in
a
house
recently
acquired
by
the
historic
new

collection
a
museum

research
society
the
video
shows
older
men
and
women
black
and
white
from
the
new
orleans
area
ostensibly
discussing
cajun
cooking
the
real
subject
is
the
bonds
and
boundaries
among
the
races
in
new
orleans
as
well
as
a
potential
loss
of
identity
should
the
cajun
language
and
customs
wither
away
several
works
pull
back
to
show
the
larger
picture
reminding
us
that
the
tragedy
of
hurricane
katrina
is
not
unique
these
include

on
the
rwandan
massacres
and

school
the
bulgarian
artist
nedko

has
covered
the
walls
of
one
classroom
with
a
tragicomedy
mostly
handwritten
suggesting
that
both
hurricane
katrina
and
a
deadly
flood
in

resulted
from
the
wrath
of
the
competing
ghosts
of
two

one
word

florida
tomorrow
obama
said
drawing
huge
bursts
of
applause
we
are
one
day
away
from
changing
the
united
states
of
america
with
mccain
already
well
into
his
day
was
obama
sleeping
in
this
morning
no
his
aides
say
after
arriving
at
the
hyatt
in
downtown
jacksonville
in
the
early
morning
hours
he
emerged
from
the
hotel
at
840
am

yes
that
was
the
democratic
nominee
in
a
ball
cap
and
black
sweat
pants

and
took
a
short
ride
to
a
golds
gym
for
45
minutes
he
worked
out
when
he
returned
to
the
hotel
at
928
am
he
went
into
seclusion
aides
said
he
had
breakfast
made
phone
calls
and
met
with
a
few
advisers
who
were
briefing
him
on
his
day
which
includes
rallies
in
jacksonville
in
north
carolina
and
in
virginia
why
only
three
states
for
obama
when
mccain
is
racing
to
seven
over
the
next
20
hours
first
aides
said
the
obama
rallies
are
held
in
large
arenas
not
airport
hangars
so
they
take
more
time
and
second
they
said
the
rallies
are
intended
to
sign
up
supporters
to
help
on
election
day
so
it
is
important
to
have
a
big
crowd
rather
than
just
a
quick
stop
for
the
local
cameras
1126
am
yes
obama
is
using
a
teleprompter
for
his
speech
in
jacksonville
but
apparently
he
is
not
reading
it
carefully
about
10
minutes
into
his
address
obama
was
talking
about
the
television
commercials
that
republicans
have
been
showing
against
him
here
in
ohio
obama
began
he
paused
momentarily
as
people
in
the
crowd
shouted
at
him
realizing
his
mistake
he
quickly
corrected
himself
florida
ive
been
traveling
too
much
obama
said
before
continuing
with
his
remarks
1150
am
stop
no

for

still
some
20
minutes
behind
schedule
tennessees
electoral
votes
are
not
up
for
grabs
in
this
reliably
red
state
but
mccain
has
descended
into
blountsville
in
this
far
northeastern
corner
to
reach
into
television
markets
in
southwestern
virginia
and
a
bit
of
north
carolina
two
states
he
desperately
needs
to
win
we

lane
of
american
politics
and

10
points
up
according
to
the
polls
going
into
election
day
and
lost
by

and
thats
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
take
nothing
for

in

and
we
dont

he

on

shortly
before
landing
in
columbus
ohio
for
the
first
of
two
appearances
in

this
afternoon
you
can
see
the
confidence
in

smile
and
his
new
accessibility
to
the
reporters
who
have
accompanied
him
for
two
months
he
spoke
to
them
for
20
minutes
on
his
plane
the
first
time
he
has
done
so
since
early
september
he
said
he
had
been
avoiding

reported
some
comments
he

were

pleasant
beautiful
golden
lateafternoon
light
but
mccains
presence
here
on
the
eve
of
election
day
means
he
is
still
battling
obamas
incursions
into
this
longtime
red
state
not
great
news
for
him
but
polls
show
him
tied
adding
to
the
troubles
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
speaker
system
again
he
repeats
his
dig
about
the
microphone
being
brought
to
you
courtesy
of
the
democratic
national
committee
he
is
hard
to
hear
and
on
top
of
that
he
is
beginning
to
sound
like
he
has
a
large
frog
in
his
throat
a
big
portion
of
mccains
campaign
plane
has
a
spectacular
cold
and
it
sounds
like
the

has
caught

430

through
a
statement
that
his

about
12
hours

obama
tossed
a
tiny
red
and
blue
football
into
the

as
he
made
calls
to
north

voters
on
the
fifth

he
turned

as
he
talked

mccain
hollers
get
your

i
need

now
here
is
something
really
different
out
of
the
blue
mccain
shouts
out
i
am
pleased
to
announce
that
i
have
received
the
alien
endorsement
this
gets
a
huge
laugh
there
are
two
more
stops
to
go
the
2008
race
for
the
white
house
that
comes
to
an
end
on
tuesday
fundamentally
upended
the
way
presidential
campaigns
are
fought
in
america
a
legacy
that
has
almost
been
lost
with
all
the
attention
being
paid
to
the
battle
between
john
mccain
and
barack
obama
it
has
rewritten
the
rules
on
how
to
reach
voters
raise
money
organize
supporters
manage
the
news
media
track
and
mold
public
opinion
and
wage

and
withstand

political
attacks
including
many
carried
by
blogs
that
did
not
exist
four
years
ago
it
has
challenged
the
consensus
view
of
the
american
electoral
battleground
suggesting
that
democrats
can
at
a
minimum
be
competitive
in
states
and
regions
that
had
long
been
republican
strongholds
the
size
and
makeup
of
the
electorate
may
be
changed
because
of
democratic
efforts
to
register
and
turn
out
new
africanamerican
hispanic
and
young
voters
this
shift
could
have
longlasting
ramifications
for
what
both
parties
do
to
build
enduring
coalitions
especially
if
intensive
and
technologically
driven
voter
turnout
programs
succeed
in
getting
more
people
registered
and
to
the
polls
efforts
by
democrats
to
win
the
allegiance
of
demographic
groups
like
africanamericans
hispanics
and
young
people
could
have
longlasting
ramifications
for
what
both
parties
do
to
build
enduring
coalitions
especially
if
intensive
and
technologically
driven
voter
turnout
programs
succeed
in
getting
more
people
registered
and
to
the
polls
i
think
well
be
analyzing
this
election
for
years
as
a
seminal
transformative
race
said
mark
mckinnon
a
senior
adviser
to
president
bushs
campaigns
in
2000
and
2004
the
year
campaigns
leveraged
the
internet
in
ways
never
imagined
the
year
we
went
to
warp
speed
the
year
the
paradigm
got
turned
upside
down
and
truly
became
bottom
up
instead
of
top
down
to
a
considerable
extent
republicans
and
democrats
say
this
is
a
result
of
the
way
that
the
obama
campaign
sought
to
understand
and
harness
the
internet
and
other
forms
of
socalled
new
media
to
organize
supporters
and
to
reach
voters
who
no
longer
rely
primarily
on
information
from
newspapers
and
television
the
platforms
ranged
from
youtube
which
did
not
exist
in
2004
to
the
cell
phone
text
messages
that
the
campaign
was
sending
out
to
supporters
on
monday
to
remind
them
to
vote
we
did
some
very
innovative
things
on
the
data
side
and
we
did
some
internet
said
sara
taylor
who
was
the
white
house
political
director
during
bushs
reelection
campaign
but
only
40
percent
of
the
country
had
broadband
back
then
you
now
have
people
who
dont
have
home
telephones
anymore
and
obama
has
done
a
tremendous
job
of
waging
a
campaign
through
the
new
media
challenge
i
dont
know
about
you
but
i
see
an
obama
internet
ad
every
day
and
i
have
for
six
months
even
more
crucial
to
the
way
this
campaign
has
transformed
politics
has
been
obamas
success
at
using
the
internet
to
build
a
huge
network
of
contributors
that
permitted
him
to
raise
enough
money

after
declining
to
participate
in
the
public
financing
system

to
expand
the
map
and
compete
in
traditionally
republican
states
no
matter
who
wins
republicans
and
democrats
say
obamas
efforts
in
places
like
indiana
north
carolina
and
virginia

organizing
and
advertising
to
voters
who
previously
had
little
exposure
to
democratic
ideas
and
candidates

will
force
future
candidates
to
think
differently
the
great
impact
that
this
election
will
have
for
the
future
is
that
it
killed
public
financing
for
all
time
said
mccains
chief
campaign
strategist
steve
schmidt
that
means
the
next
republican
presidential
campaign
hopefully
a
reelection
for
john
mccain
will
need
to
be
a
billiondollar
affair
to
challenge
what
the
democrats
have
accomplished
with
the
use
of
the
internet
and
viral
marketing
to
communicate
and
raise
money
it
was
a
profound
leap
forward
technologically
schmidt
added
republicans
will
have
to
figure
out
how
to
compete
with
this
in
order
to
become
competitive
again
at
a
national
level
and
in
house
and
senate
races
this
transformation
did
not
happen
this
year
alone
in
2000
bushs
campaign
lead
by
karl
rove
and
ken
mehlman
pioneered
the
use
of
microtargeting
to
find
and
appeal
to
potential
new
supporters
in
2004
the
presidential
campaign
of
howard
dean
was
widely
credited
with
being
the
first
to
see
the
potential
power
of
the
internet
to
raise
money
and
sign
up
volunteers
a
platform
that
obama
tremendously
expanded
they
were
apollo
11
and
we
were
the
wright
brothers
said
joe
trippi
the
manager
of
deans
campaign
terry
nelson
political
director
of
the
bush
campaign
in
2004
said
that
the
evolution
was
challenging
campaign
operatives
who
worked
for
every
presidential
campaign
and
would
continue
in
2012
and
beyond
we
are
in
the
midst
of
a
fundamental
transformation
of
how
campaigns
are
run
nelson
said
and
its
not
over
yet
the
changes
go
beyond
what
obama
did
and
reflect
a
cultural
shift
in
voters
producing
an
audience
that
is
at
once
better
informed
more
skeptical
and
from
reading
blogs
sometimes
trafficking
in
rumors
or
suspect
information
as
a
result
this
new
electorate
tends
to
be
more
questioning
of
what
they
are
told
by
campaigns
and
often
uses
the
web
to
do
their
own
factchecking
you
do
focus
groups
and
people
say
i
saw
that
ad
and
i
went
to
this
web
site
to
check
it

said
david
plouffe
the
obama
campaign
manager
they
are
policing
the
campaigns
schmidt
said
the
speed
and
diversity
of
the
news
cycle
had
broken
down
the
traditional
way
that
voters
received
information
and
had
given
campaigns
opportunities
and
challenges
in
trying
to
manage
the
news
the
news
cycle
is
hyperaccelerated
and
driven
by
new
players
on
the
landscape
like
politico
and
huffington
post
which
cause
competition
for
organizations
like
the
ap
where
there
is
a
high
premium
on
being
first
he
said
this
hyperaccelerates
a
cable
news
cycle
driven
to
conflict
and
drama
and
trivia
among
the
biggest
changes
this
year
is
the
intense
new
interest
in
politics
reflected
in
jumps
in
voter
registration
numbers
early
voting
and
attendance
at
obamas
rallies
to
no
small
extent
that
is
a
reflection
of
the
unusual
interest
stirred
by
his
campaign
thus
it
is
hardly
clear
that
a
future
candidate
who
appropriated
all
the
innovations
that
obama
and
his
campaign
tried
would
necessarily
have
the
same
success
as
obama
without
the
candidate
who
excites
people
plouffe
said
you
can
have
the
greatest
strategy
and
machinery
and
it
wont
matter
trippi
who
worked
for
one
of
obamas
rivals
in
the
democratic
primary
campaign
john
edwards
said
it
has
all
come
together
for
one
guy
barack
obama
but
now
that
its
happened
its
a
permanent
change
a
campaign
waged
under
the
specter
of
war
and
financial
crisis
drew
to
an
anxious
finish
on
monday
as
sens
barack
obama
and
john
mccain
raced
across
nine
states
and
asked
voters
on
both
sides
to
discount
polls
and
predictions
on
the
closing
day
of
a
twoyear
pursuit
of
the
presidency
obama
surrendered
the
race
to
the
judgment
of
the
american
people
as
he
told
a
booming
crowd
here
now
its
all
about
who
wants
it
more
who
believes
in
it
more
mccain
sought
to
motivate
republicans
who
worried
aloud
that
it
could
be
a
bleak
election
declaring
the
mac
is
back
in
the
final
hours
of
his
second
bid
for
the
presidency
mccain
dashed
through
republicanleaning
states
from
florida
to
indiana
and
new
mexico
to
nevada
he
stopped
in
tennessee
hoping
to
reach
voters
in
north
carolina
and
virginia
and
he
swung
by
pennsylvania
the
only
democratic
state
of
the
day
he
was
set
to
return
home
for
a
rally
in
arizona
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
obama
confident
in
his
standing
on
democratic
terrain
devoted
his
final
day
of
campaigning
by
trying
to
push
florida
north
carolina
and
virginia
into
his
column
he
pressed
ahead
after
he
awoke
to
news
that
his
grandmother
the
woman
chiefly
responsible
for
his
upbringing
had
died
overnight
in
hawaii
the
election
eve
travels
of
both
men
as
well
as
their
running
mates
offered
a
viewers
guide
of
the
states
whose
outcomes
will
loom
large
in
settling
who
will
become
the
nations
44th
president
after
the
polls
close
on
tuesday
the
candidates
lastminute
efforts
were
amplified
by
their
muscular
ground
organizations
and
unprecedented
advertising
barrages
across
all
modes
of
technology
the
obama
campaign
tested
its
text
messaging
program
to
remind
voters
particularly
young
ones
to
go
to
the
polls
the
mccain
campaign
activated
its
automated
phone
system
to
check
in
with
any
voter
who
has
shown
an
interest
in
the
republican
ticket
in
their
pitches
to
voters
both
candidates
struck
optimistic
chords
delivering
a
few
gracious
words
about
their
opponent
and
offering
their
own
pledges
to
change
washington
yet
neither
man
refrained
from
reprising
the
piercing
criticisms
that
have
become
the
soundtrack
for
the
fivemonth
general
election
fight
at
the
end
of
this
long
race
i
want
to
congratulate
him
on
the
tough
race
that
he
has
fought
obama
said
speaking
of
mccain
during
a
morning
speech
here
at
veterans
memorial
auditorium
he
can
point
to
a
few
items
where
he
has
broke
with
president
bush
but
when
it
comes
from
the
central
issue
of
this
election
the
plain
truth
is
john
mccain
has
stood
with
george
bush
mccain
delivered
a
truncated
version
of
his
stump
speech
at
each
stop
but
grew
hoarser
as
the
day
progressed
his
staff
said
he
appeared
to
be
catching
the
bad
cold
that
had
waylaid
many
passengers
in
his
campaign
plane
by
late
afternoon
in
indiana
he
was
using
throat
lozenges
to
try
to
get
through
the
rest
of
the
marathon
my
friends
you
know
that
ive
been
fighting
for
this
country
since
i
was
17
years
old
and
i
have
the
scars
to
prove
it
he
told
a
rally
in
indianapolis
as
he
battled
to
prevent
obama
from
taking
a
state
that
has
not
backed
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
since
1964
four
hours
later
mccain
dropped
into
the
supposed
home
of
space
aliens
roswell
nm
i
am
pleased
to
announce
that
i
have
received
the
alien
endorsement
he
told
the
crowd
to
an
uproar
of
laughter
as
the
contest
headed
to
its
finish
an
air
of
normality
surrounded
obama
there
was
no
rush
of
friends
or
advisers
on
the
plane
for
the
final
flights
his
demeanor
at
least
from
his
public
appearances
seemed
the
same
as
it
has
for
months
his
schedule
of
rallies
was
no
more
aggressive
or
different
than
at
any
point
in
the
general
election
only
a
few
close
advisers
knew
that
at
8
am
he
had
received
word
from
his
sister
that
his
86yearold
grandmother
madelyn
dunham
had
died
when
he
arrived
at
a
rally
he
spoke
briefly
about
the
woman
whom
he
visited
late
last
month
in
honolulu
during
a
brief
suspension
of
his
campaign
she
has
gone
home
obama
said
his
voice
tinged
with
emotion
she
died
peacefully
in
her
sleep
with
my
sister
at
her
side
so
theres
great
joy
instead
of
tears
mccain
as
he
sprinted
through
seven
states
warned
voters
at
every
stop
of
the
differences
between
the
outlooks
and
policies
of
the
republican
and
democratic
tickets
he
didnt
dally
spending
30
minutes
at
each
stop
with
his
argument
boiled
down
to
fit
the
frenzied
moment
sen
obamas
running
to
punish
the
successful
mccain
said
at
his
opening
stop
in
tampa
im
running
to
make
everyone
successful
at
each
stop
the
drill
for
mccain
was
nearly
the
same
he
raced
out
of
his
plane
walked
a
few
steps
to
an
airport
hangar
told
the
crowd
he
had
to
win
florida
virginia
and
pennsylvania
and
delivered
a
truncated
version
of
his
speech
the
mood
on
the
mccain
campaign
plane
was
upbeat
and
punchy
throughout
the
day
as
mccains
advisers
continued
to
hammer
their
belief
that
the
polls
were
tightening
and
that
mccains
chances
of
winning
the
presidency
were
difficult
but
not
impossible
winning
270
is
right
in
the
cards
mccains
campaign
manager
rick
davis
insisted
to
reporters
around
midnight
on
sunday
as
mccains
plane
headed
from
new
hampshire
to
florida
mccain
drew
stirring
applause
from
his
crowds

as
well
as
jeers
directed
at
the
democratic
rival

when
he
said
obama
wanted
to
spread
the
wealth
around
hes
in
the
far
left
lane
of
american
politics
mccain
said
the
barnstorming
rallies
the
dawntodusk
television
commercials
and
the
armies
of
volunteers
flooding
those
neighborhoods
belied
the
reality
of
how
america
elects
its
president
with
millions
of
ballots
have
already
cast
though
early
voting
in
ohio

lines
looped
in

record
number
of
voters
adding
their
ballots
to
those
that
have
been
collected
for
nearly
a
month
early
signs
point
skyward
for
the
democrats
who
outnumbered
republicans
by
more
than
two
to
one
in
florida
about
37
percent
of
registered
voters
have
already
cast
their
ballots
state
officials
said
setting
the
stage
for
potentially
recordbreaking
turnout
in
virginia
where
more
restrictions
are
placed
on
early

the
state
has
processed
465962
absentee
ballots
and
more
than
300000
virginians
voted
in
person
by
an
absentee
ballot
that
contrasts
with
the
2004
total
of
222059
absentee
ballots
cast
worried
about
the
outlook
in
virginia
where
a
democrat
hasnt
won
the
presidential
race
in
more
than
four
decades
mccains
campaign
sued
the
states
election
board
on
monday
they
asserted
that
the
absentee
ballots
werent
mailed
on
time
to
military
members
serving
overseas
obama
selected
virginia
as
the
site
of
his
final
rally
a
sign
democrats
are
waging
an
allout
push
for
the
state
that
is
seen
as
a
barometer
for
the
fight
with
mccain
in
virginia
and
around
the
country
both
sides
are
keeping
a
close
eye
on
the
weather
conditions
for
election
day
i
think
if
it
rained
mud
it
wont
make
a
difference
said
douglas
wilder
the
former
governor
of
virginia
who
was
the
states
first
black
chief
executive
theyre
coming
out
trust
me
theyre
coming
out
a
top
iranian
minister
who
admitted
to
faking
his
university
degree
will
face
a
motion
of
no
confidence
on
tuesday
on
charges
that
he
tried
to
bribe
members
of
parliament
not
to
impeach
him
members
of
parliament
had
questioned
the
qualifications
of
the
official
interior
minister
ali
kordan
when
president
mahmoud
ahmadinejad
nominated
him
for
the
post
in
august
the
previous
minister
had
been
dismissed
because
of
his
differences
with
the
president
kordan
claimed
to
have
been
awarded
an
honorary
doctorate
from
oxford
university
but
a
parliamentary
investigation
found
not
only
that
kordans
phd
was
a
fake
but
also
that
he
had
neither
the
bachelors
nor
masters
degrees
he
had
claimed
from
an
iranian
university
the
scandal
over
his
impeachment
turned
into
a
crisis
on
wednesday
when
a
government
official
muhammad
abbassi
distributed
5000
checks
among
parliamentary
ministers
who
had
signed
the
impeachment
motion
the
weekly
news
magazine
shahrvand
emrooz
reported
that
abbassi
gave
the
checks
as
a
donation
for
the
legislators
local
mosques
but
asked
them
to
sign
two
receipts
one
of
those
receipts
was
for
a
letter
to
the
speaker
of
parliament
asking
for
the
impeachment
to
be
dropped
ali
asghar
zarei
a
legislator
close
to
ahmadinejad
slapped
abbassi
in
the
face
and
the
speaker
expelled
the
official
from
parliament
later
abbassi
was
dismissed
by
ahmadinejad
who
said
he
would
not
bother
to
appear
in
parliament
to
defend
his
minister
who
cares
even
if
kordans
degree
is
fake
the
islamic
republic
news
agency
quoted
ahmadinejad
as
asking
i
have
already
said
that
it
is
just
a
torn
piece
of
paper
because
it
was
only
an
honorary
degree
ahmadinejad
said
he
did
not
consider
the
impeachment
legal
because
kordan
had
done
nothing
wrong
kordan
refused
to
resign
despite
calls
by
legislators
analysts
believe
that
the
impeachment
would
undermine
ahmadinejads
standing
in
the
coming
presidential
elections
in
june
2009

tabatinga
resembles
a
small
version
of
ho
chi
minh
city
vietnam
another
chaotic
place
where
cars
take
a
distant
back
seat
as
the
preferred
mode
of
transportation
i
have
never
seen
a
place
with
so
many
motorbikes
said
sabrina
dassumpcao
a
resident
of
rio
de
janeiro
who
was
visiting
her
husband
a
military
officer
at
the
army
base
here
recently
it
is
practically
a
city
run
entirely
by
motorbikes
tabatinga
owes
much
of
its
motoobsession
to
its
location
along
brazils
extreme
western
frontier
nestled
alongside
colombia
and
just
across
a
narrow
river
from
peru
the
town
has
evolved
in
the
last
quarter
century
from
a
military
town
into
a
hub
of
crossborder
commerce
the
open
border
with
leticia
colombia
allows
brazilians
to
buy
japanesemade
motorbikes
there
for
about
2000
half
of
what
they
cost
in
brazil
chinesemade
models
which
are
less
popular
with
residents
can
be
had
for
as
little
as
900
on
the
river
island
of
santa
rosa
in
peru
said
ulianov
mejia
the
manager
of
the
yamaha
motorbike
store
in
tabatinga
here
you
can
have
breakfast
in
brazil
lunch
in
colombia
and
dinner
in
peru
because
its
a
triple
border
said
mejia
a
colombian
who
is
married
to
a
brazilian
woman
and
has
been
living
here
since
2001
in
recent
years
the
relative
strength
of
the
brazilian
economy
and
its
currency
the
real
has
made
it
easier
for
brazilians
to
afford
motorbikes
easy
credit
terms
allow
people
to
pay
in
up
to
24
installments
and
most
people
walk
out
of
a
store
with
a
bike
after
putting
down
just
30
percent
mejia
said
for
some
it
can
be
even
easier
than
that
if
a
fisherman
from
the
river
doesnt
have
documents
doesnt
have
a
checking
account
but
if
i
know
him
know
where
he
lives
know
his
family
i
will
sell
to
him
without
a
problem
mejia
said
the
ease
of
acquiring
a
motorbike
has
helped
fuel
the
growth
of
the
city
which
has
doubled
in
population
in
the
past
20
years
surging
past
neighboring
leticia
which
has
about
35000
residents
and
about
10000
motorbikes
there
are
families
that
have
six
or
seven
motorbikes
said
joel
santos
de
lima
tabatingas
mayor
they
are
cheap
and
easy
to
buy
and
they
help
keep
the
economy
moving
for
those
who
cannot
afford
their
own
motorbikes
tabatinga
boasts
500
twowheeled
moto
taxis
run
by
four
companies
for
one
and
a
half
reals
about
70
cents
a
moto
taxi
will
take
you
anywhere
in
the
city
the
drivers
are
the
model
of
efficiency
and
reliability
said
waldery
nobre
mesquita
a
doctor
who
uses
them
daily
to
see
patients
by
law
the
moto
taxis
are
allowed
to
carry
only
one
passenger
said
anderson
de
souza
tabatingas
public
transportation
coordinator
but
that
seems
to
be
where
the
rules
stop
and
the
lawlessness
begins
tabatinga
does
not
require
motorbikes
to
be
registered
or
residents
to
wear
helmets
the
process
of
applying
for
a
license
plate
and
insuring
a
motorbike
is
laden
with
bureaucracy
and
costs
about
500
more
than
most
residents
can
afford
de
souza
said
since
a
helmet
law
is
enforced
across
the
colombian
border
in
leticia
drivers
stop
at
the
border
and
pick
up
a
visorless
helmet
from
stands
along
the
street
vendors
charge
75
cents
for
the
rented
helmets
which
must
be
returned
at
the
border
in
tabatinga
the
issue
is
more
complicated
city
officials
here
worry
that
the
borders
reputation
for
violent
drug
trafficking
makes
anyone
who
wears
a
helmet
a
potential
suspect
where
you
have
trafficking
you
have
death
de
souza
said
when
assassins
want
to
kill
they
use
helmets
so
they
cant
be
identified
for
that
reason
tabatinga
informally
prohibits
the
wearing
of
helmets
on
motorbikes
though
it
is
not
a
written
law
he
said
that
makes
matters
even
trickier
when
it
rains

and
rain
can
be
torrential
in
the
amazon
most
moto
taxi
drivers
simply
don
a
rain
slicker
and
continue
working
some
wearing
helmets
rain
is
the
one
time
when
actual
fourwheeled
taxis
get
a
chance
to
get
in
the
game
but
good
luck
finding
one
without
calling
first
trying
to
cement
the
areas
motorbike
culture
a
decade
ago
mejia
and
a
friend
tried
to
line
up
bikes
stretching
for
five
kilometers
just
over
three
miles
from
tabatinga
into
leticia
a
representative
from
the
guinness
book
of
world
records
showed
up
to
witness
the
worldrecord
attempt
he
said
but
in
the
end
the
duo
could
not
pull
it
off
if
it
had
been
something
organized
by
the
city
with
resources
we
could
have
gotten
into
the
book
mejia
said
outside
of
asia
no
one
could
beat
tabatinga
and
leticia
for
having
more
motorbikes
no
one
conservative
commentators
had
a
lot
of
fun
mocking
sen
barack
obamas
use
of
the
phrase
the
fierce
urgency
of
now
noting
that
it
had
originated
with
the
rev
dr
martin
luther
king
jr
obama
made
it
a
cornerstone
of
his
early
campaign
speeches
conservatives
kicked
the
phrase
around
like
a
soccer
ball
the
fierce
urgency
of
now
they
would
say
giggling
what
does
it
mean
well
if
your
house
is
on
fire
and
your
family
is
still
inside
thats
an
example
of
the
fierce
urgency
of
now
something
like
that
is
the
case
in
the
united
states
right
now
as
americans
go
to
the
polls
in
what
is
probably
the
most
important
presidential
election
since
world
war
ii
a
mindboggling
series
of
crises
is
threatening
not
just
the
shortterm
future
but
the
very
viability
of
the
nation
the
economy
is
sinking
into
quicksand
the
financial
sector
guardian
of
the
nations
wealth
is
leaning
on
the
crutch
of
a
trilliondollar
taxpayer
bailout
the
giant
auto
companies

for
decades
the
highpowered
gasguzzling
exhaustspewing
pride
of
american
industry

are
on
life
support
as
the
holiday
shopping
season
approaches
the
nation
is
hemorrhaging
jobs
the
value
of
the
family
home
has
plunged
retirement
plans
are
shrinking
like
ice
cubes
on
a
hot
stove
and
economists
are
telling
us
the
recession
has
only
just
begun
its
in
that
atmosphere
that
voters
tuesday
will
be
choosing
between
the
crisismanagement
skills
of
obama
who
has
enlisted
joe
biden
as
aidedecamp
and
those
of
sen
john
mccain
who
is
riding
to
the
rescue
with
sarah
palin
and
joe
the
plumber
in
tow
as
important
as
this
choice
has
become
the
election
is
just
a
small
first
step
what
americans
really
have
to
decide
is
what
kind
of
country
they
want
right
now
the
united
states
is
a
country
in
which
wealth
is
funneled
absurdly
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
the
richest
1
percent
of
americans
now
holds
close
to
40
percent
of
all
the
wealth
in
the
nation
and
maintains
an
iron
grip
on
the
levers
of
government
power
this
is
not
only
unfair
but
selfdefeating
the
united
states
cannot
thrive
with
its
fabulous
wealth
concentrated
at
the
top
and
the
middle
class
on
its
knees
no
one
even
bothers
to
talk
about
the
poor
anymore
how
to
correct
this
imbalance
is
one
of
the
biggest
questions
facing
the
country
the
united
states
is
also
a
country
in
which
blissful
ignorance
is
celebrated
and
intellectual
excellence
the
key
to
21st
century
advancement
is
not
just
given
short
shrift
but
is
ridiculed
paris
hilton
and
britney
spears
are
cultural
icons
the
average
american
watches
television
a
mindnumbing
4
12
hours
a
day
at
the
same
time
our
public
school
system
is
plagued
with
some
of
the
highest
dropout
rates
in
the
industrialized
world
math
and
science
forget
about
it
too
tough
for
these
tv
watchers
or
too
boring
or
whatever
when
i
compare
our
high
schools
with
what
i
see
when
im
traveling
abroad
said
bill
gates
i
am
terrified
for
our
work
force
of
tomorrow
the
point
here
is
that
as
we
approach
the
end
of
the
first
decade
of
the
21st
century
the
united
states
is
in
deep
deep
trouble
yet
instead
of
looking
for
creative
21stcentury
solutions
to
these
enormous
problems
too
many
of
our
socalled
leaders
are
behaving
like
clowns
or
worse

spouting
garbage
in
the
pubic
sphere
that
hearkens
back
to
the
1940s
and
50s
thoughtful
welleducated
men
and
women
are
denounced
as
elites
and
thus
the
enemies
of
ordinary
americans
attempts
to

while
the

of
a

asserts
there
is
no
god
americans
have
to
decide
if
they
want
a
country
that
tolerates
this
kind
of
debased
backward
behavior
or
if
they
want
a
country
that
aspires
to
true
greatness

a
country
that
stands
for
more
than
the
mere
rhetoric
of
equality
freedom
opportunity
and
justice
that
decision
will
require
more
than
casting
a
vote
in
one
presidential
election
it
will
require
a
great
deal
of
reflective
thought
and
hard
work
by
a
committed
citizenry
the
great
promise
of
america
hinges
on
a
government
that
works
openly
and
honestly
for
the
broad
interests
of
the
american
people
as
opposed
to
the
narrow
benefit
of
the
favored
wealthy
few
by
all
means

today
but
that
is
just
the
first
step
toward
meaningful
change
the
2008
race
for
the
white
house
that
comes
to
an
end
on
tuesday
fundamentally
upended
the
way
presidential
campaigns
are
fought
in
america
a
legacy
that
has
almost
been
lost
with
all
the
attention
being
paid
to
the
battle
between
john
mccain
and
barack
obama
it
has
rewritten
the
rules
on
how
to
reach
voters
raise
money
organize
supporters
manage
the
news
media
track
and
mold
public
opinion
and
wage

and
withstand

political
attacks
including
many
carried
by
blogs
that
did
not
exist
four
years
ago
it
has
challenged
the
consensus
view
of
the
american
electoral
battleground
suggesting
that
democrats
can
at
a
minimum
be
competitive
in
states
and
regions
that
had
long
been
republican
strongholds
the
size
and
makeup
of
the
electorate
may
be
changed
because
of
democratic
efforts
to
register
and
turn
out
new
africanamerican
hispanic
and
young
voters
this
shift
could
have
longlasting
ramifications
for
what
both
parties
do
to
build
enduring
coalitions
especially
if
intensive
and
technologically
driven
voter
turnout
programs
succeed
in
getting
more
people
registered
and
to
the
polls
efforts
by
democrats
to
win
the
allegiance
of
demographic
groups
like
africanamericans
hispanics

could

i
think
well
be
analyzing
this
election
for
years
as
a
seminal
transformative
race
said
mark
mckinnon
an
adviser
to
president
bushs
campaigns
in
2000
and
2004
the
year
campaigns
leveraged
the
internet
in
ways
never
imagined
the
year
we
went
to
warp
speed
the
year
the
paradigm
got
turned
upside
down
and
truly
became
bottom
up
instead
of
top
down
to
a
considerable
extent
this
is
a
result
of
the
way
that
the
obama
campaign
sought
to
understand
and
harness
the
internet
and
other
forms
of
socalled
new
media
to
organize
supporters
and
to
reach
voters
who
no
longer
rely
primarily
on
information
from
newspapers
and
television
the
platforms
ranged
from
youtube
which
did
not
exist
in
2004
to
the
cell
phone
text
messages
that
the
campaign
was
sending
out
to
supporters
on
monday
to
remind
them
to
vote
even
more
crucial
to
the
way
this
campaign
has
transformed
politics
has
been
obamas
success
at
using
the
internet
to
build
a
huge
network
of
contributors
that
permitted
him
to
raise
enough
money

after
declining
to
participate
in
the
public
financing
system

to
expand
the
map
and
compete
in
traditionally
republican
states
google
the
titan
of
silicon

dolly
parton
are
two
of
the
many
combatants
in
a
hightechnology
dispute
over
precious
slices
of
the
nations
airwaves
the
issue
comes
to
a
head
on
election
day
when
the
federal
communications
commission
votes
on
a
proposal
to
make
a
disputed
chunk
of
radio
spectrum
available
for
public
use
google
microsoft
hewlettpackard
and
other
technology
companies
say
the
spectrum
could
be
used
by
a
whole
new
array
of
internetconnected
wireless
gadgets
they
say
freeing
it
up
would
encourage
innovation
and
investment
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
spread
of
wifi
technology
has
this
would
generate
more
business
for
technology
companies
but
a
coalition
of
oldguard
media

from
television
networks
to
broadway
producers

is
objecting
to
the
proposal
saying
it
needs
a
closer
look
the
opponents
argue
that
signals
sent
over
those
frequencies
could
interfere
with
broadcasts
and
wireless
microphones
at
live
productions
the
measure
appears
likely
to
pass
though
its
opponents
have
mounted
a
spirited
latestage
lobbying
effort
supported
by
sen
hillary
rodham
clinton
dny
and
others
in
congress
also
opposed
are
the
professional
sports
leagues
las
vegas
casinos
a
coalition
of
rock
musicians
and
of
late
parton
who
produces
live
shows
if
the
spectrum
is
set
free
parton
says
chaos
could
reign
on
broadway

in
the
form
of
static
and
other
interference
technology
companies
argue
that
if
soothe
spectrum
is
freed
entrepreneurs
and
innovators
will
create
a
new
generation
of
devices
that
transmit
signals
farther
and
more
reliably
than
wifi
which
also
relies
on
unlicensed
spectrum
the
technology
could
also
handle
cheap
internetbased
phone
calls
the
battle
between
the
old
media
and
new
media
companies
is
a
byproduct
of
an
impending
change
in
the
way
overtheair
tv
signals
are
delivered
in
february
tv
stations
will
be
required
to
switch
from
analog
broadcasting
to
digital
which
is
less
susceptible
to
radio
interference
the
theory
behind
the
fcc
proposal
is
that
handheld
devices
and
other
gadgets
emit
such
low
levels
of
power
that
their
transmissions
will
not
overlap
or
interfere
with
the
digital
tv
signals
also
the
proposals
supporters
say
devices
can
be
made
smart
enough
to
sense
when
they
might
interfere
with
a
broadcast
signal
and
find
another
frequency
the
fcc
has
been
studying
the
potential
for
interference
and
found
that
most
problems
can
be
avoided
through
tight
regulation
of
the
new
devices
said
kevin
j
martin
chairman
of
the
fcc
who
proposed
the
white
space
measure
the
fivemember
commission
seems
likely
to
approve
the
measure
according
to
several
people
who
were
involved
in
the
agencys
internal
discussions
but
who
declined
to
be
named
because
they
were
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
terms
blockbuster
business
case
one
that
might
put
an
end
to
thousands
of
statecourt
injury
suits
but
the
argument
in
the
supreme
court
on
monday
in
the
case
of
a
vermont
musician
who
lost
her
arm
after
receiving
an
injection
of
an
antinausea
drug
quickly
turned
into
a
search
for
limiting
principles
the
case
wyeth
v
levine
no
061249
concerns
an
implied
form
of
the
doctrine
of
preemption
which
bars
state
lawsuits
from
people
injured
by
products
that
met
federal
safety
standards
the
drug
law
at
issue
in
the
case
says
nothing
about
preemption
and
the
question
before
the
court
was
whether
the
food
and
drug
administrations
approval
of
drug
labels
should
knock
out
state
lawsuits
contending
that
the
labels
did
not
contain
adequate
warnings
a
broad
endorsement
of
implied
preemption
based
on
regulators
actions
rather
than
on
statements
in
laws
enacted
by
congress
could
shut
down
countless
injury
suits
in
cases
involving
not
only
drugs
but
also
motor
vehicles
household
products
chemicals
and
agricultural
products
several
justices
appeared
open
to
the
idea
that
preemption
could
follow
from
the
fdas
approval
of
a
drug
label

but
only
if
drug
companies
remained
subject
to
lawsuits
if
they
failed
to
disclose
new
information
about
potential
risks
there
was
much
discussion
of
what
information
should
be
considered
new
other
justices
seemed
prepared
to
allow
preemption

but
only
if
the
drug
agency
had
considered
the
particular
risk
before
approving
the
label
given
the
justices
interest
in
those
finer
points
the
court
seemed
unlikely
to
rule
broadly
on
the
larger
issues
in
the
case
whether
the
agency
and
other
federal
regulators
set
minimum
safety
standards
that
states
are
free
to
augment
or
whether
they
make
judgments
about
the
optimal
balance
between
risks
and
benefits
that
states
must
follow
in
february
an
eightjustice
majority
of
the
court
ruled
in
riegel
v
medtronic
that
suits
concerning
injuries
caused
by
medical
devices
were
preempted
by
a
1976
federal
law
but
the
underlying
law
in
riegel
required
preemption
in
so
many
words
in
the
jargon
it
involved
express
preemption
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
argued
on
monday
diana
levine
lost
her
arm
after
being
injected
with
a
wyeth
drug
phenergan
the
drug
is
safe
levines
lawyers
said
when
administered
by
intramuscular
injection
or
by
intravenous
drip
but
they
said
that
efforts
to
inject
the
drug
directly
into
a
vein
carry
enormous
risks
a
vermont
clinic
used
that
third
method
known
as
iv
push
and
apparently
missed
the
vein
when
the
drug
was
exposed
to
levines
arterial
blood
it
caused
swift
and
irreversible
gangrene
requiring
amputation
of
her
arm
below
the
elbow
levine
settled
with
the
clinic
and
sued
wyeth
saying
the
company
should
have
added
a
warning
telling
doctors
not
to
use
the
risky
method
seth
p
waxman
a
lawyer
for
wyeth
said
the
company
had
provided
ample
lavish
warnings
about
the
risks
involved
and
left
it
to
medical
professionals
to
make
the
ultimate
judgment
about
how
to
administer
the
drug
justices
samuel
a
alito
jr
and
ruth
bader
ginsburg
both
questioned
the
costbenefit
calculation
that
allowed
the
drug
to
be
administered
by
iv
push
on
the
benefit
side
of
this
you
dont
have
a
lifesaving
drug
you
have
a
drug
that
relieves
nausea
alito
said
on
the
risk
side
you
have
the
risk
of
gangrene
justice
antonin
scalia
said
that
what
mattered
was
not
whether
the
agencys
decision
was
sound
but
whether
it
had
addressed
the
issue
at
all
if
youre
telling
me
the
fda
acted
irresponsibly
scalia
told
levines
lawyer
david
c
frederick
then
sue
the
fda
chief
justice
john
g
roberts
jr
tried
to
boil
down
fredericks
argument
to
a
simple
test
if
the
fda
had
considered
the
risks
involved
in
ivpush
administration
levine
would
lose
if
the
fda
had
not
considered
those
risks
levine
would
win
frederick
said
levine
would
win
under
that
analysis
saying
the
fda
had
never
specifically
compared
the
risks
of
methods
of
intravenous
administration
waxman
said
he
understood
that
members
of
this
court
are
concerned
about
applying
a
broad
vague
or
freewheeling
analysis
but
levines
case
he
added
is
in
the
heartland
of
implied
preemption
given
that
the
jury
had
awarded
damages
for
wyeths
failure
to
alter
the
very
drug
label
the
fda
had
approved

the

has
become
a
symbol
of
the
antagonism
between
the
bush
administration
and
president
hugo
chavez
of
venezuela
who
has
used
his

oil
wealth

also
testified
that
he
was
told
an

42
million
was
on

and
he
said
there
had
been
previous

from

to

in
the
region
an
internal
review
by
the
american
military
has
found
that
a
local
afghan
police
chief
and
another
district
leader
helped
taliban
militants
carry
out
an
attack
on
july
13
in
which
nine
us
soldiers
were
killed
and
a
remote
american
outpost
in
eastern
afghanistan
was
nearly
overrun
afghan
and
american
forces
had
started
building
the
makeshift
base
just
five
days
before
the
attack
and
villagers
repeatedly
warned
the
american
troops
in
that
time
that
militants
were
plotting
a
strike
the
report
found
it
said
that
the
warnings
did
not
include
details
and
that
troops
never
anticipated
such
a
large
and
wellcoordinated
attack
the
assault
involved
some
200
fighters
nearly
three
times
the
number
of
the
american
and
afghan
forces
defending
the
site
as
evidence
of
collusion
between
the
district
police
chief
and
the
taliban
the
report
cited
large
stocks
of
weapons
and
ammunition
that
were
found
in
the
police
barracks
in
the
adjacent
village
of
wanat
after
the
attackers
were
repelled
the
stocks
were
more
than
the
local
20officer
force
would
be
likely
to
need
and
many
of
the
weapons
were
dirty
and
appeared
to
have
been
used
recently
the
police
officers
were
found
dressed
in
crisp
clean
new
uniforms
the
report
said
and
were
acting
as
if
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
had
occurred
the
attackers
were
driven
back
after
a
pitched
fourhour
battle
in
which
american
artillery
warplanes
and
attack
helicopters
were
ultimately
called
in
still
the
militants
fought
in
ways
that
showed
imaginative
military
training
if
not
sophisticated
weapons
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
american
soldiers
were
at
times
flushed
out
into
the
open
when
they
fled
what
they
thought
were
grenades
but
were
in
fact
rocks
thrown
by
taliban
attackers
the
report
said
the
day
before
the
attack
the
militants
began
flowing
water
through
an
irrigation
ditch
feeding
an
unused
field
creating
background
noise
that
masked
the
sounds
of
the
advancing
fighters
the
base
and
a
nearby
observation
post
were
held
by
just
48
american
troops
and
24
afghan
soldiers
nine
americans
died
and
27
were
injured
most
in
the
first
20
minutes
of
the
fight
four
afghan
soldiers
were
also
wounded
the
intensity
of
the
attack
was
so
fierce
the
report
said
that
american
soldiers
shot
at
insurgents
as
close
as
10
yards
away
often
until
their
weapons
jammed
and
at
militants
who
shimmied
up
trees
overhanging
their
positions
to
shoot
at
the
americans
the
attack
on
the
outpost
near
wanat
caused
the
worst
single
loss
for
the
american
military
in
afghanistan
since
june
2005
and
one
of
the
worst
overall
since
the
invasion
in
late
2001
it
underscored
the
vulnerability
of
american
forces
in
afghanistan
as
well
as
the
continuing
problem
posed
by
uncertainties
over
the
loyalties
of
their
afghan
allies
especially
the
afghan
police
the
military
investigating

governor
be
replaced
if
not
arrested
but
the
senior
american
commander
in
eastern
afghanistan
maj
gen
jeffrey
j
schloesser
decided
after
conferring
with
american
forces
that
relieved
the
unit
that
the
district
governor
had
probably
been
acting
under
duress
and
had
been
cooperative
with
american
troops
according
to
the
generals
spokeswoman
lt
col
rumi
nielsongreen
nielsongreen
said
in
a
telephone
interview
on
monday
that
while
the
governor
had
been
absolved
it
was
unclear
whether
the
police
chief
in
wanat
was
complicit
a
spokesman
for
afghan
defense
ministry
officials
said
the
americans
had
never
discussed
these
complaints
with
them
hajji
abdul
halim
deputy
governor
at
the
time
of
the
wanat
attack
and
now
the
acting
governor
of
nearby
nuristan
province
said
monday
that
both
officials
had
been
detained
briefly
and
then
released
we
suspected
them
after
the
incident
but
the
american
forces
released
the
district
governor
after
two
days
of
custody
he
said
in
a
telephone
interview
the
report
which
was
completed
on
aug
13
and
declassified
in
recent
days
to
allow
military
officials
to
brief
family
members
of
those
who
were
killed
did
not
assign
blame
to
any
commanders
of
the
unit
involved

the
2nd
battalion
503rd
infantry
regiment
173rd
airborne
combat
brigade
team

a
unit
that
was
in
the
final
days
of
a
15month
deployment
when
the
attack
took
place
the
actions
by
leaders
at
all
levels
were
based
upon
sound
military
analysis
proper
risk
mitigation
and
for
the
right
reasons
the
report
said
it
concluded
that
despite
reports
earlier
in
july
that
200
to
300
militants
had
been
massing
to
attack
another
remote
outpost
in
the
same
vicinity
the
commanders
at
wanat
had
no
reason
to
expect
such
a
large
frontal
assault
the
enemy
normally
conducts
probing
attacks
prior
to
conducting
an
allout
largescale
attack
the
report
said
quoting
the
investigating
officer
as
concluding
that
it
was
logical
to
think
that
an
initial
probing
attack
would
involve
only
about
20
militants
seeking
to
gauge
defenses
and
the
reaction
of
american
and
afghan
forces
however
the
report
criticized
the
incredible
amount
of
time

10
months

it
took
the
nato
military
authorities
to
negotiate
arrangements
over
the
site
of
the
outpost
giving
adversaries
plenty
of
time
to
plan
coordinated
and
complex
attacks
some
details
of
the
attack
have
been
described
in
recent
months
by
publications
including
the
new
york
times
the
army
times
and
vanity
fair
but
the
44page
report
offers
the
most
extensive
account
so
far
at
the
time
of
the
attack
american
and
afghan
forces
were
still
building
fortifications
of
sandbags
and
earthen
barriers
around
the
main
outpost
and
a
small
observation
post
about
100
yards
away
in
some
places
those
troops
were
protected
only
by
strands
of
concertina
wire
and
a
ring
of
gunmounted
armored
humvees
the
report
said
the
militants
apparently
detected
the
vulnerability
and
moved
to
exploit
it
on
the
evening
of
july
12
the
militants
slipped
into
the
village
undetected
by
the
americans
ordered
the
villagers
to
leave
and
set
up
firing
positions
inside
houses
and
a
mosque
at
420
am
on
july
13
the
militants
struck
with
a
fusillade
of
heavy
machinegun
fire
and
rocketpropelled
grenades
destroying
the
americans
most
potent
weapons
120mm
mortars
and
a
tow
missile
launcher
at
the
same
time
the
militants
blasted
the
small
observation
post
100
yards
from
the
main
base
with
rifle
fire
and
more
grenades
within
20
minutes
all
nine
americans
inside
were
dead
or
wounded
three
times
teams
of
soldiers
from
the
main
base
ran
a
gantlet
of
hostile
fire
to
resupply
the
observation
post
and
carry
back
the
dead
and
wounded
within
30
minutes
american
fighterbombers
were
blasting
the
militant
positions
followed
by
apache
helicopter
gunships
just
days
after
the
attack
american
forces
abandoned
the
outpost
at
wanat
but
nielsongreen
said
the
military
continued
to
patrol
in
the
region
from
a
larger
base
four
miles
away
this
was
a
complex
attack
carried
out
by
militants
who
clearly
knew
the
terrain
and
maintained
radio
silence
he
said
gunmen
dressed
as
security
guards
kidnapped
a
french
aid
worker
in
central
kabul
monday
morning
and
shot
dead
an
afghan
bystander
who
tried
to
thwart
the
abduction
police

said
the
kidnapping
was
the
latest
of
a
series
of
incidents
spreading
alarm
among

it
was
carried
out
just

was
killed
in

said
it
had
executed
her
for

christianity
there
was
no
immediate
claim
if
responsibility
for
mondays
kidnapping
but
the
taliban
denied
involvement
two
french
aid
workers
were
making
their

from
their

when
three

tackled
one
of

and
grabbed
his

the

killed
the

pushed
the

into
a
car
and
drove

in

said
the
abducted
man
was
a
french

and
education
expert
who
had
been
in

for
only
a
week
he
had
been
staying
with
colleagues
from
afrane
which
also
specializes
in

projects
but
worked
for
a

the

his

said
the

were
dressed
as

there
has
been
a
string
of
kidnappings
in
the
capital
and
neighboring
provinces
recently
involving
both
foreigners
and
prominent
afghans
many
of
them
have
been
blamed
by

a

service
the
national
security
directorate
a
report
released
by
the
alaska
personnel
board
on
monday
found
that
gov
sarah
palin
did
not
apply
improper
pressure
to
try
to
dismiss
a
state
trooper
who
was
her
former
brother
in
law
and
did
not
violate
state
ethics
laws
in
the
firing
of
her
state
public
safety
commissioner
the
report
contradicts
the
conclusions
last
month
of
a
separate
inquiry
into
the
matter
overseen
by
a
bipartisan
legislative
panel
the
panel
found
that
palin
had
breached
a
state
ethics
act
by
pressing
to
have
the
trooper
mike
wooten
fired
it
said
however
that
the
governor
was
within
her
rights
to
fire
the
public
safety
commissioner
walt
monegan
the
boards
report
based
on
an
investigation
led
by
an
independent
counsel
hired
by
the
board
timothy
j
petumenos
concluded
there
was
no
evidence
to
prove
ms
palin
or
any
state
employee
had
acted
improperly
in
monegans
dismissal
the
report
said
the
legislative
inquiry
had
based
its
conclusions
on
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
state
ethics
laws
and
insufficient
evidence
palins
lawyer
thomas
v
van
flein
said
in
a
statement
the
governor
is
grateful
that
this
investigation
has
provided
a
fair
and
impartial
review
of
this
matter
and
upholds
the
governors
ability
to
take
measures
when
necessary
to
ensure
that
alaskans
have
the
best
possible
team
working
to
serve
them
monegan
has
said
he
believes
he
was
fired
because
he
would
not
bend
to
pressure
from
palin
her
husband
todd
and
her
subordinates
to
fire
wooten
who
had
been
through
a
bitter
divorce
with
the
governors
sister
he
has
also
said
that
he
had
received
many
complaints
about
wooten
from
palin
her
husband
and
several
members
of
her
administration
and
that
he
felt
clear
pressure
to
terminate
wooten
petumenos
said
the
governor
and
other
state
employees
had
testified
firmly
that
several
conversations
monegan
described
had
not
happened
he
said
there
were
no
witnesses
other
than
monegan
who
said
they
heard
the
conversations
they
didnt
happen
at
all
petumenos
said
unless
someone
can
be
proved
to
abuse
their
power
petumenos
added
it
seems
to
me
they
havent
done
it
monegan
said
monday
in
an
interview
obviously
im
disappointed
with
the
outcome
and
the
contradictory
nature
of
this
investigation
compared
to
the
first
one
its
not
only
me
he
said
there
were
senior
members
of
the
department
of
public
safety
who
got
the
calls
felt
the
pressure
and
knew
exactly
what
was
going
on
i
will
always
feel
that
there
were
conversations
and
emails
that
were
intended
to
inappropriately
use
an
official
government
position
to
settle
a
family
matter
the
governor
of
alaska
appoints
the
members
of
the
alaska
personnel
board
though
all
three
of
the
boards
current
members
were
appointed
by
palins
predecessor
palin
reappointed
one
member
to
a
new
term
said
a
spokesman
for
the
governor
bill
mcallister
this
is
obviously
the
correct
outcome
mcallister
said
we
knew
all
along
that
governor
palin
did
not
abuse
her
power
john
cyr
the
executive
director
of
the
alaska
public
safety
employees
association
said
it
was
not
surprising
that
a
board
appointed
by
the
governors
office
would
reach
the
conclusion
we
all
knew
that
the
governors
office
was
putting
pressure
on
the
department
of
public
safety
to
take
action
against
michael
wooten
cyr
said
in
late
july
several
weeks
after
monegan
was
fired
the
states
bipartisan
legislative
council
ordered
an
inquiry
into
his
but
tension
over
the
matter
increased
dramatically
in
late
august
when
palin
was
selected
as
the
running
mate
for
sen
john
mccain
the
republican
nominee
for
president
the
inquiry
undercut
her
image
as
an
ethics
reformer
palin
said
in
the
summer
that
she
would
cooperate
with
the
legislative
inquiry
but
after
she
was
nominated
she
refused
to
testify
the
mccainpalin
campaign
sent
lawyers
and
staff
to
alaska
to
help
with
the
governors
legal
strategy
and
to
make
what
for
several
weeks
was
an
almost
daily
public
relations
effort
to
portray
the
legislative
inquiry
as
biased
and
run
by
democrats
who
support
sen
barack
obama
in
september
palin
took
the
unusual
step
of
filing
an
ethics
complaint
against
herself
to
the
personnel
board
which
she
said
was
the
proper
forum
for
dealing
with
the
matter
the
boards
report
conducted
by
petumenos
was
what
was
filed
on
monday
the
report
by
petumenos
said
it
was
based
on
substantially
more
evidence
than
the
legislative
inquiry
including
a
threehour
deposition
from
palin
the
governor
refused
to
testify
for
the
legislative
inquiry
petumenos
said
the
legislative
inquiry
had
determined
that
palin
violated
the
scope
of
state
ethics
laws
by
inaction
because
she
supposedly
did
not
stop
her
staff
and
husband
from
pressuring
monegan
but
petumenos
said
that
the
legislative
inquiry
had
not
met
requirements
for
finding
a
violation
because
it
did
not
cite
violations
under
specific
sections
of
the
ethics
code
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
terms
blockbuster
business
case
one
that
might
put
an
end
to
thousands
of
statecourt
injury
suits
but
the
argument
in
the
supreme
court
on
monday
in
the
case
of
a
vermont
musician
who
lost
her
arm
after
receiving
an
injection
of
an
antinausea
drug
quickly
turned
into
a
search
for
limiting
principles
the
case
wyeth
v
levine
no
061249
concerns
an
implied
form
of
the
doctrine
of
preemption
which
bars
state
lawsuits
from
people
injured
by
products
that
met
federal
safety
standards
the
drug
law
at
issue
in
the
case
says
nothing
about
preemption
and
the
question
before
the
court
was
whether
the
food
and
drug
administrations
approval
of
drug
labels
should
knock
out
state
lawsuits
contending
that
the
labels
did
not
contain
adequate
warnings
a
broad
endorsement
of
implied
preemption
based
on
regulators
actions
rather
than
on
statements
in
laws
enacted
by
congress
could
shut
down
countless
injury
suits
in
cases
involving
not
only
drugs
but
also
motor
vehicles
household
products
chemicals
and
agricultural
products
several
justices
appeared
open
to
the
idea
that
preemption
could
follow
from
the
fdas
approval
of
a
drug
label

but
only
if
drug
companies
remained
subject
to
lawsuits
if
they
failed
to
disclose
new
information
about
potential
risks
there
was
much
discussion
of
what
information
should
be
considered
new
other
justices
seemed
prepared
to
allow
preemption

but
only
if
the
drug
agency
had
considered
the
particular
risk
before
approving
the
label
given
the
justices
interest
in
those
finer
points
the
court
seemed
unlikely
to
rule
broadly
on
the
larger
issues
in
the
case
whether
the
agency
and
other
federal
regulators
set
minimum
safety
standards
that
states
are
free
to
augment
or
whether
they
make
judgments
about
the
optimal
balance
between
risks
and
benefits
that
states
must
follow
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
argued
on
monday
diana
levine
lost
her
arm
after
being
injected
with
a
wyeth
drug
phenergan
the
drug
is
safe
levines
lawyers
said
when
administered
by
intramuscular
injection
or
by
intravenous
drip
but
they
said
that
efforts
to
inject
the
drug
directly
into
a
vein
carry
enormous
risks
a
vermont
clinic
used
that
third
method
known
as
iv
push
and
apparently
missed
the
vein
when
the
drug
was
exposed
to
levines
arterial
blood
it
caused
swift
and
irreversible
gangrene
requiring
amputation
of
her
arm
below
the
elbow
levine
settled
with
the
clinic
and
sued
wyeth
saying
the
company
should
have
added
a
warning
telling
doctors
not
to
use
the
risky
method
seth
p
waxman
a
lawyer
for
wyeth
said
levines
case
he
added
is
in
the
heartland
of
implied
preemption
given
that
the
jury
had
awarded
damages
for
wyeths
failure
to
alter
the
very
drug
label
the
fda
had
approved
a
federal
court
has
blocked
the
bush
administrations
effort
to
save
money
on
medicare
by
paying
for
only
the
least
expensive
treatments
for
particular
conditions
congress
sets
medicare
payment
rates
and
never
intended
to
give
officials
broad
discretion
to
alter
them
the
court
said
in
an
important
test
case
last
month
the
case
closely
followed
by
medicare
officials
and
consumer
advocates
involved
drugs
used
to
treat
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
judge
henry
h
kennedy
jr
of
us
district
court
here
said
the
policy
of
paying
for
only
the
least
costly
alternative
was
not
permitted
under
the
medicare
law
the
administrations
position
would
give
the
health
and
human
services
secretary
enormous
discretion
to
determine
the
amount
paid
for
every
item
and
service
covered
by
medicare
without
reference
to
the
detailed
formulas
set
by
congress
kennedy
said
this
flies
in
the
face
of
the
detailed
statutory
provisions
he
added
over
the
years
medicare
officials
have
often
tried
to
adopt
regulations
that
allow
them
to
consider
cost
in
deciding
whether
the
program
should
cover
various
goods
and
services
health
care
providers
manufacturers
and
some
patients
advocates
have
resisted
these
efforts
saying
that
coverage
decisions
should
be
made
based
on
clinical
effectiveness
and
not
cost
we
are
disappointed
with
the
ruling
and
continue
to
believe
that
our
policy
is
supported
by
the
statute
peter
l
ashkenaz
a
spokesman
for
the
federal
centers
for
medicare
and
medicaid
services
said
monday
we
are
still
considering
our
options
and
next
steps
congress
set
forth
the
touchstone
for
medicare
coverage
in
a
1965
law
that
created
the
program
the
law
generally
prohibits
payment
for
items
and
services
that
are
not
reasonable
and
necessary
for
the
diagnosis
or
treatment
of
illness
or
injury
or
to
improve
the
functioning
of
a
malformed
body
member
if
an
item
is
covered
the
payment
rate
is
specified
in
other
parts
of
the
law
the
bush
administration
argued
that
medicare
officials
had
the
right
to
decide
whether
the
expense
incurred
for
a
given
item
not
just
the
item
itself
was
reasonable
and
necessary
kennedy
said
this
argument
does
not
make
sense
because
congress
went
to
great
lengths
to
establish
payment
rates

each
sounded
hopeful

not

confident
and
energized
though
exhaustion
lay
behind
the
smiles
while
hopscotching
among
swing
states
on
monday

after
22
months
of
memorable
campaigning
there
were
a
few
final
memorable
lines
obama
on
mtv
criticizing
sagging
pants
brothers
should
pull
up
their
pants
and
gov
sarah

warning
voters
in

made
a

announcement
he

is
showing

and
his

be
proud
obama
is
returning
to
his
two

and
his

after
a
long
long
run
his
parents
and

would
be
proud
too

sen
john
mccain
at
a
rally
in
indianapolis
an
internal
review
by
the
american
military
has
found
that
a
local
afghan
police
chief
and
another
district
leader
helped
taliban
militants
carry
out
an
attack
on
july
13
in
which
nine
us
soldiers
were
killed
and
a
remote
american
outpost
in
eastern
afghanistan
was
nearly
overrun
afghan
and
american
forces
had
started
building
the
makeshift
base
just
five
days
before
the
attack
and
villagers
repeatedly
warned
the
american
troops
in
that
time
that
militants
were
plotting
a
strike
the
report
found
it
said
that
the
warnings
did
not
include
details
and
that
troops
never
anticipated
such
a
large
and
wellcoordinated
attack
the
assault
involved
some
200
fighters
nearly
three
times
the
number
of
the
american
and
afghan
forces
defending
the
site
as
evidence
of
collusion
between
the
district
police
chief
and
the
taliban
the
report
cited
large
stocks
of
weapons
and
ammunition
that
were
found
in
the
police
barracks
in
the
adjacent
village
of
wanat
after
the
attackers
were
repelled
the
stocks
were
more
than
the
local
20officer
force
would
be
likely
to
need
and
many
of
the
weapons
were
dirty
and
appeared
to
have
been
used
recently
the
police
officers
were
found
dressed
in
crisp
clean
new
uniforms
the
report
said
and
were
acting
as
if
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
had
occurred
the
attack
on
the
outpost
near
wanat
caused
the
worst
single
loss
for
the
american
military
in
afghanistan
since
june
2005
and
one
of
the
worst
overall
since
the
invasion
in
late
2001
it
underscored
the
vulnerability
of
american
forces
in
afghanistan
as
well
as
the
continuing
problem
posed
by
uncertainties
over
the
loyalties
of
their
afghan
allies
especially
the
afghan
police
the
military
investigating
officer
an
army
colonel
whose
identity
was
not
disclosed
in
a
redacted
copy
of
the
report
provided
to
the
new
york
times
recommended
that
the
police
chief
and
the
district
governor
be
replaced
if
not
arrested
but
the
senior
american
commander
in
eastern
afghanistan
maj
gen
jeffrey
j
schloesser
decided
after
conferring
with
american
forces
that
relieved
the
unit
that
the
district
governor
had
probably
been
acting
under
duress
and
had
been
cooperative
with
american
troops
according
to
the
generals
spokeswoman
lt
col
rumi
nielsongreen
nielsongreen
said
in
a
telephone
interview
on
monday
that
while
the
governor
had
been
absolved
it
was
unclear
whether
the
police
chief
in
wanat
was
complicit
a
spokesman
for
afghan
defense
ministry
officials
said
the
americans
had
never
discussed
these
complaints

a
campaign
waged
under
the
specter
of

and
financial
crisis
drew
to
an
anxious
finish
on
monday
as
sens
barack
obama
and
john
mccain
raced
across
nine
states
and
asked
voters
on
both
sides
to
discount
polls
and
predictions
on
the
closing
day
of
a
twoyear
pursuit
of
the
presidency
obama
surrendered
the
race
to
the
judgment
of
the
american
people
as
he
told
a
booming
crowd
here
now
its
all
about
who
wants
it
more
who
believes

mccain
sought
to
motivate

who
worried
aloud
that
it
could
be
a
bleak
election
declaring
the
mac
is
back
in
the
final
hours
of
his
second
bid
for

mccain
dashed
through

to

he
stopped
in

hoping
to
reach
voters
in

and
virginia
and
he
swung
by
pennsylvania
the
only
democratic
state
of
the
day
he
was
set
to
return
home
for
a
rally
in
arizona
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
obama
confident
in
his
standing
on
democratic
terrain
devoted
his
final
day
of
campaigning
by
trying
to
push
florida
north
carolina
and
virginia
into
his
column
he
pressed
ahead
after
he
awoke
to
news
that
his
grandmother
the
woman
chiefly
responsible
for
his
upbringing
had
died
overnight
in
hawaii
only
a
few
close
advisers
knew
that
at
8
am
he
had
received
word
from
his
sister
that
his
86yearold
grandmother
madelyn
dunham
had
died
when
he
arrived
at
a

he
spoke
briefly
about
the
woman
whom
he
visited
late
last
month
in
honolulu
during
a
brief
suspension
of
his
campaign
she
has
gone
home
obama
said
his
voice
tinged
with
emotion
she
died
peacefully
in
her
sleep
with
my
sister
at
her
side
so
theres
great
joy
instead
of
tears
the
mood
on
the

was
upbeat
as
mccains
advisers
continued
to
insist
that
the
polls
were
tightening
and
that
mccains
chances
of
winning
the

were
difficult
but
not
impossible
winning

on
monday
and
sentenced
him
to
life
in

giving
the

administration
a
second
conviction
in
a
warcrimes
trial
there
but
the
conviction
of
the
detainee
ali
hamza
al
bahlul
was
a
measured
victory
for
the
government
which
has
been
struggling
for
seven
years

prove
the
effectiveness
of
its
military
commission
system
for
trying
terrorism
suspects
at
the
us
naval
station
at

the
guilty
verdict
had
been
expected
because
bahlul
a
yemeni
who
prosecutors
said
was
a
close
aide
to
osama
bin
laden
did
not
offer
any
defense
saying
he
did
not
accept
the
authority
of

he
insisted
that
his
lawyer
remain
mute
in
a
weeklong
trial
that
drew
little
attention
the
pentagons
response
to

some

who
work
on

say
the

uncertain

of

possibility
that

pakistani
paramilitary

in

sunday
after

of

said
in
a
statement
continuing
drone
attacks
on
our
territory
which
result
in
loss
of
precious
lives
and
property
are
counterproductive
and
difficult
to
explain
by
a
democratically
elected
government
it
is
creating
a
credibility
gap
there
was
no
comment
or
public
appearances
by
petraeus
and
it
was
not
clear
how
he
responded
to
the
complaints

the

are
completing
reviews
on

made
clear
that

would
be
more
of

focus
if

a
senior
pakistani
military
official
said
the

wanted
to
bring
home
the
point
that
the

that
this

it

the
outcome
will
have
major
ramifications
as
a
massive
budget
shortfall
is
causing

to
cut

the
rulings
expected
within
the
next
several
months
will
likely
determine
hundreds
of
similar
corporate

the
underlying
issue
revolves
around
how
companies
apportion
profits
and
other
business
activities
to
entities
in
other
states
a
massachusetts
victory
would
result
in
a
flood
of

that
would
offset
budget
problems
if

loses

to
get
their
money
back
if
the
state
loses
the
toys
r
us
case
is
the
most
prominent
of
such
disputes
the
toy
company
nearly
20
years
ago
set
up
a
subsidiary
in
delaware
and
gave
that
unit
ownership
of
its
trademark
geoffrey
the
giraffe
delaware
does
not
tax
income
on
intangible
assets
such
as
trademarks
the
company
had
its
stores
in
massachusetts
and
other
states
pay
royalties
to
the
delaware
firm
for
use
of
the
geoffrey
trademark
according
to
court
filings
tax
officials
said
the
move
effectively
transferred
profits
that
would
be
taxable
in
massachusetts
to
a
nontax
jurisdiction
the
amount
now
in
dispute
is
16
million
plus
penalties
and
interest
between
1997
and
2001
the
legal
battle
involves
competing
interpretations
of
the
commerce
clause
of
the
us
constitution
which
regulates
trade
across
state
borders
massachusetts
and
tax
officials
from
other
states
argue
the
clause
gives
them
authority
to
collect
income
taxes
when
a
companys
business
activities
are
substantially
connected
to
the
state
lawyers
for
toys
r
us
and
other
companies
with
similar
disputes
contend
in
court
filings
the
constitution
only
allows
states
to
tax
businesses
that
are
physically
present
within
their
borders
an
interpretation
that
would
prevent
the
delaware
subsidiary
from
being
taxed
by
other
states
that
interpretation
however
has
failed
to
persuade
courts
in
south
carolina
louisiana
new
york
and
oklahoma
which
over
the
years
have
ruled
against
toys
r
us
a
toys
r
us
spokesman
did
not
respond
to
a
call
seeking
comment
a
spokesman
for
microsoft
which
has
a
similar
legal
fight
here
said
it
has
complied
with
state
tax
laws
and
will
continue
to
seek
a
resolution
in
court
in
the
capital
one
case
the
state
argues
the
bank
effectively
has
a
taxable
business
presence
in
massachusetts
because
of
the
thousands
of
credit
card
transactions
it
has
with
card
holders
and
businesses
even
though
it
doesnt
have
a
local
branch
office
or
other
physical
presence
here
capital
one
did
not
return
a
phone
call
seeking
comment
in
court
documents
capital
one
argued
that
because
it
does
not
have
employees
or
property
in
massachusetts
it
should
not
pay
state
taxes
under
the
commerce
clause
and
lawyers
for
other
companies
said
the
state
is
trying
to
equate
a
transaction
on
an
electronic
network
with
one
in
a
local
bank
branch
this
is
about
something
much
more
important
than
tax
dollars
said
griswold
the
attorney
who
represents
mbna
its
about
the
principle
of
federalism
and
when
states
are
going
to
be
permitted
to
reach
beyond
their
borders
to
exercise
dominion
over
citizens
of
another
state
mbna
has
a
dispute
with
massachusetts
that
mirrors
the
capital
one
case
the
tjx
lawsuit
involves
an
arrangement
the
company
set
up
in
the
early
1990s
that
treated
royalty
and
interest
payments
from
subsidiaries
as
deductions
that
lowered
its
overall
tax
liability
in
the
late
1990s
massachusetts
pressed
the
retailer
to
pay
more
taxes
on
the
grounds
the
deductions
were
improper
the
contested
amount
is
around
196
million
in
2006
the
states
appellate
tax
board
ruled
in
the
revenue
departments
favor
although
it
later
allowed
tjx
some
of
the
deductions
a
tjx
spokeswoman
declined
to
comment
in
a
similar
case
a
comcast
spokeswoman
said
the
company
believes
it
has
complied
with
tax
laws
and
is
working
with
the
state
to
resolve
the
matter
which
involves
issues
from
its
acquisition
of
atampampt
broadband
in
2002
a
spokesman
for
home
depot
also
said
the
company
is
working
with
the
state
this
year
the
massachusetts
legislature
changed
the
states
corporate
tax
law
to
prevent
many
of
these
disputes
from
arising
in
the
first
place
the
law
known
as
combined
reporting
requires
companies
to
lump
income
together
from
all
their
business
units
and
apportion
a
share
to
massachusetts
thus
preventing
them
from
shifting
profits
to
nontaxable
subsidiaries

2008
is
a
historic
day
because
it
marks
the
end
of
an
economic
era
a
political
era
and
a
generational
era
all
at
once
economically
it
marks
the
end
of
the
long
boom
which
began
in
1983
politically
it
probably
marks
the
end
of
conservative
dominance
which
began
in
1980
generationally
it
marks
the
end
of
baby
boomer
supremacy
which
began
in
1968
for
the
past
16
years
baby
boomers
who
were
formed
by
the
tumult
of
the
1960s
occupied
the
white
house
by
tuesday
night
if
the
polls
are
to
be
believed
a
member
of
a
new
generation
will
become
presidentelect
so
today
is
not
only
a
pivot
but
a
confluence
of
pivots
when
historians
look
back
at
the
era
that
is
now
closing
they
will
see
a
time
of
private
achievement
and
public
disappointment
in
the
past
two
decades
the
united
states
has
become
a
much
more
interesting
place
companies
like
starbucks
apple
crate
ampamp
barrel
microsoft
and
many
others
enlivened
daily
life
private
citizens
especially
young
people
repaired
the
social
fabric
dedicated
themselves
to
community
service
and
lowered
crime
and
teenage
pregnancy
yet
at
the
same
time
the
public
sphere
has
not
flourished
despite
decades
of
affluence
longstanding
issues
like
health
care
education
energy
and
entitlement
debt
have
not
been
adequately
addressed
the
baby
boomers
who
entered
adulthood
promising
a
lifetime
of
activism
have
been
a
politically
undistinguished
generation
they
produced
two
presidents
neither
of
whom
lived
up
to
his
potential
they
remained
consumed
by
the
culture
war
that
divided
their
generation
they
pass
their
political
supremacy
today
having
squandered
the
fat
years
and
the
golden
opportunities
month
by
month
frustration
has
mounted
americans
are
anxious
about
their
private
lives
but
absolutely
disgusted
by
public
leaders
so
change
is
demanded
republicans
nominated
an
old
warrior
with
a
record
of
making
hard
decisions
and
absorbing
the
blows
that
ensue
many
of
us
regard
him

and
always
will

as
one
of
the
heroes
of
our
time
but
the
public
demand
for
change
was
total
and
if
the
polls
are
right
voters
will
elect
the
man
who
breaks
from
the
recent
past
in
almost
every
way
barack
obama
is
a
child
of
a
child
of
the
1960s
his
mother
was
born
only
five
years
earlier
than
hillary
clinton
for
people
in
obamas
generation
the
great
disruption
had
already
occurred
by
the
time
they
hit
adulthood
theirs
is
a
generation
of
consolidation
and
neotraditionalism

a
generation
of
sunscreen
and
bicycle
helmets
more
anxious
about
parenthood
than
anything
else
obama
is
not
only
a
member
of
this
temperate
generation
but
of
its
most
educated
segment
he
has
lived
nearly
his
entire
adult
life
within
a
few
miles
of
one
or
another
of
the
countrys
top
10
universities
his
upscale
educated
class
postboomer
cohort
has
rallied
behind
him
with
unalloyed
fervor
major
college
newspapers
have
endorsed
him
at
a
ratio
of
631
the
upscale
educated
class

from
the
universities
the
media
the
law
and
the
financial
centers

has
financed
his
600
million
campaign
which
relied
on
bigdollar
donations
even
more
heavily
than
george
w
bushs
2004
effort
this
cohort
will
soon
become
the
ruling
class
and
the
irony
is
that
they
will
be
confronted
by
the
problem
for
which
they
have
the
least
experience
and
for
which
they
are
the
least
prepared
the
problem
of
scarcity
raised
in
prosperity
favored
by
genetics
these
young
meritocrats
will
have
to
govern
in
a
period
when
the
demands
on
the
nations
wealth
outstrip
the
supply
they
will
grapple
with
the
growing
burdens
of
an
aging
society
rising
health
care
costs
and
high
energy
prices
they
will
have
to
make
up
for
the
trillion
or
so
dollars
the
government
will
spend
to
avoid
a
deep
recession
they
will
have
to
struggle
to
keep
their
promises
to
cut
taxes
create
an
energy
revolution
pass
an
expensive
health
care
plan
and
all
the
rest
as
robert
j
samuelson
writes
in
his
forthcoming
book
the
great
inflation
and
its
aftermath
already
americans
face
far
more
claims
on
their
incomes
than
can
be
easily
met
in
the
next
few
years
the
nations
wealth
will
either
stagnate
or
shrink
the
fiscal
squeeze
will
grow
severe
there
will
be
fiercer
struggle
over
scarce
resources
starker
divisions
along
factional
lines
the
challenge
for
the
next
president
will
be
to
cushion
the
pain
of
the
coming
recession
while
at
the
same
time
trying
to
build
a
solid
fiscal
foundation
so
the
country
can
thrive
at
some
point
in
the
future
were
probably
entering
a
period
in
other
words
in
which
smart
young
liberals
meet
a
stonecold
scarcity
that
they
do
not
seem
to
recognize
or
have
a
plan
for
in
an
age
of
transition
the
children
are
left
with
the
burdens
of
their
elders
the
caucus
a
fairweather
forecast
on
election
day
much
of
america
including
most
of
the
battleground
states
will
see
fair
weather
that
will
encourage
voters
to
go
to
the
polls
according
to
the
national
weather
service
temperatures
are
expected
be
mild
for
this
time
of
year
in
many
large
urban
areas
and
precipitation
should
be
minimal
weather
of
course
can
be
a
factor
in
voter
turnout
especially
for
democrats
because
democrats
tend
to
be
less
affluent
than
republicans
and
to
live
in
larger
cities
the
theory
goes
they
not
only
depend
more
on
public
transportation
to
get
to
the
polls
but
also
vote
in
precincts
that
are
prone
to
long
lines
and
thus
are
more
vulnerable
to
bad
weather
a
2004
study
of
a
centurys
worth
of
data
about
weather
on
election
day
concluded
that
when
it
rained
the
negative
effect
on
democratic
performance
of
turnout
is
significantly
increased
and
that
weather
accounts
for
about
a
5point
swing
in
turnout
another
study
published
in
2005
found
that
every
inch
of
rain
above
average
on
election
day
gives
republicans
an
additional
25
percent
of
the
vote
and
every
inch
of
snow
above
average
increases
the
republican
vote
share
by
06
percent
so
where
are
the
exceptions
to
sunny
skies
north
carolina
and
virginia
which
are
heavily
contested
are
expected
to
get
rain
and
up
to
3
or
4
inches
in
some
areas
and
the
pacific
northwest
into
the
rockies
could
see
significant
amounts
of
rain
or
snow
though
primarily
in
uncontested
wyoming
reliably
republican
some
parts
of
colorado
which
has
emerged
as
one
of
the
mostcontested
states
in
the
campaign
could
also
be
hit
by
that
storm
but
nevada
another
battleground
state
is
not
likely
to
be
affected
and
in
missouri
where
the
race
is
perhaps
the
tightest
in
the
country
its
going
to
be
a
beautiful
day
for
voting
said
brian
cordy
a
forecaster
at
the
national
weather
service

larry
rohter
style
no
hiphop
look
for
obama
one
of
the
most
memorable
moments
in
the
1992
presidential
campaign
came
on
an
mtv
show
when
a
young
woman
cheekily
asked
bill
clinton
boxers
or
briefs
it
took
until
the
last
day
of
the
2008
campaign
for
the
subject
of
undergarments
to
come
up
again
and
it
was
an
mtv
interviewer
who
brought
it
up
the
answer
from
sen
barack
obama
keep
them
in
your
pants
the
subject
was
raised
by
sway
calloway
of
mtv
news
who
asked
obama
if
he
supported
ordinances
to
ban
sagging
pants
a
style
inspired
by
hiphop
artists
here
is
my
attitude
obama
replied
i
think
people
passing
a
law
against
people
wearing
sagging
pants
is
a
waste
of
time
we
should
be
focused
on
creating
jobs
improving
our
schools
health
care
dealing
with
the
war
in
iraq
and
anybody
any
public
official
that
is
worrying
about
sagging
pants
probably
needs
to
spend
some
time
focusing
on
real
problems
out
there
but
it
was
clear
that
obama
was
not
a
fan
of
the
look
brothers
should
pull
up
their
pants
he
said
you
are
walking
by
your
mother
your
grandmother
your
underwear
is
showing
whats
wrong
with
that
come
on
obama
passed
on
the
boxersorbriefs
question
earlier
this
year
when
it
was
posed
by
a
reporter
for
us
weekly
i
dont
answer
those
humiliating
questions
but
whichever
one
it
is
i
look
good
in
them
he
said
according
to
the
magazine

michael
falcone
comics
foreshadowing
a
political
first
before
sen
barack
obama
of
illinois
there
was
gov
tim
pettigrew
of
new
york
the
first
black
presidential
nominee
of
the
democratic
party
but
that
happened
in
1976
and
in
the
pages
of
treasure
chest
a
comic
book
distributed
to
catholic
school
students
around
the
country
its
been
on
the
edge
of
reality
berry
reece
author
of
the
series
said
of
the
current
election
i
frankly
had
forgotten
about
this
pettigrew
series
reece
added
until
national
public
radio
unearthed
it
earlier
this
year
writing
in
1964
of
an
election
12
years
later
reece
now
76
initially
used
the
story
of
pettigrew
and
his
bid
for
the
democratic
nod
to
walk
students
through
the
abcs
of
the
nomination
process
the
candidate
survives
an
assassination
attempt
and
soldiers
through
a
debate
with
sen
willard
oilandgas
but
his
face
is
hidden
until
the
last
few
panels
of
the
final
episode
what
we
wanted
to
do
reece
said
was
get
the
readers
in
deep
through
this
pettigrews
integrity
his
charisma
before
we
ever
disclosed
his
race
so
that
they
would
not
prejudge
him
reece
said
he
was
inspired
by
the
political
turmoil
of
the
period
especially
in
his
home
state
mississippi
it
was
red
stateblue
state
to
the
15th
power
he
said
but
his
strip
has
also
predicted
more
recent
history
new
york
for
example
now
has
a
black
governor
and
in
his
debate
with
sen
oilandgas
pettigrew
must
defend
himself
against
charges
of
cowardice
in
vietnam
there
was
absolutely
no
way
of
foreseeing
the
swift
boat
attack
said
reece
now
living
in
annapolis
md
he
says
the
same
of
the
core
plot
twist
there
was
absolutely
no
prescience
said
reece
who
supported
obama
in
the
maryland
primary
it
was
just
a
young
mans
dream
reece
ended
the
series
with
a
cliffhanger
could
he
win
well
it
would
depend
in
part
on
how
the
boys
and
girls
who
were
reading
this
grew
up
and
voted
fortyfour
years
later
the
strip
will
have
a
conclusion

sarah
wheaton
the
next
president
is
about
to
inherit
an
economy
in
a
nose
dive
and
a
stock
market
flat
on
its
back
thats
painfully
bad
news
for
most
of
us
but
a
big
opportunity
for
him
compared
with
other
daunting
challenges
that
will
face
either
barack
obama
or
john
mccain
as
president
the
economy
in
general
and
the
stock
market
in
particular
are
fixable
markets
are
notoriously
difficult
to
predict
but
they
almost
always
rebound
from
plunging
corrections
over
time
four
years
should
be
plenty
the
current
stock
market
decline
is
not
historic
but
it
has
been
wrenchingly
bad
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
has
lost
345
percent
since
its
peak
reached
in
october
2007
all
but
one
of
the
dow
averages
30
stocks
has
lost
money
this
year
other
presidents
who
took
office
with
the
nation
in
financial
turmoil
benefitted
from
the
stock
markets
resilience
franklin
roosevelt
ronald
reagan
and
even
gerald
ford
saw
a
troubled
market
begin
to
rebound
in
less
than
four
years
all
three
of
those
presidents
faced
different
specific
challenges
but
each
inherited
stock
markets
suffering
because
of
serious
economic
problems
when
they
first
took
office
roosevelt
famously
dealt
with
the
great
depression
of
the
1930s
reagan
took
office
amid
a
recession
and
skyhigh
interest
rates
of
18
to
20
percent
ford
battled
a
recession
and
doubledigit
inflation
rates
of
the
mid1970s
the
nations
economic
problems
did
not
disappear
by
the
end
of
those
terms
and
the
economy
remained
downright
dire
in
1936
after
roosevelts
first
four
years
in
office
but
stock
prices
had
moved
sharply
higher
in
each
case
the
stock
market
roughly
tripled
in
value
during
the
first
roosevelt
term
the
ford
stock
market
lost
ground
at
first
but
eventually
climbed
about
20
percent
the
dow
jones
industrials
earned
a
total
return
of
60
percent
during
the
first
reagan
term
which
turned
out
to
be
the
launching
pad
for
one
of
the
20th
centurys
great
bull
markets
despite
the
crash
of
1987
one
safe
bet
we
will
still
be
looking
at
real
economic
problems
at
the
end
of
the
coming
administrations
fouryear
term
but
stock
prices
will
also
be
significantly
higher
than
todays
levels
history
offers
a
few
stock
market
lessons
for
the
next
president
he
can
help
by
trying
to
stimulate
the
economy
and
projecting
leadership
at
a
time
when
confidence
matters
more
than
usual
the
next
president
could
exercise
real
power
by
doing
both
but
he
will
also
discover
the
limits
to
his
influence
over
the
market
the
president
is
not
responsible
for
the
stock
market
says
richard
sylla
a
market
historian
and
economics
professor
at
new
york
university
but
if
they
appear
to
be
in
charge
and
do
things
to
address
the
countrys
economic
ills
people
will
rally
behind
them
a
little
bit
its
almost
a
psychological
thing
people
feel
good
about
a
new
president
anyway
roosevelt
certainly
projected
leadership
as
a
new
president
as
did
reagan
what
each
actually
did

launching
the
new
deal
cutting
taxes

also
made
a
difference
but
other
factors
beyond
their
control
were
at
work
too
the
stock
market
had
fallen
so
dramatically
by
the
time
roosevelt
took
office
in
1933
it
was
almost
impossible
for
it
to
go
lower
in
fact
stocks
had
actually
bounced
off
the
bottom
before
he
took
office
the
market
soared
during
roosevelts
first
term
but
fell
hard
after
he
won
reelection
call
that
good
political
timing
all
the
way
around
reagan
came
to
office
in
early
1981
pursuing
change
his
admirers
called
a
revolution
but
federal
reserve
chairman
paul
volcker
was
more
important
to
the
economy
and
markets
volcker
drove
interest
rates
sky
high
to
curb
dangerous
inflation
the
strategy
worked
and
the
stock
market
advanced
but
the
high
rates
inflicted
real
pain
along
the
way
sylla
says
reagan
advisers
worried
about
the
political
fallout
and
initially
urged
the
president
to
blame
everything
on
volcker
which
he
declined
to
do
volcker
is
remembered
for
bold
action
but
reagan
also
benefitted
from
the
stock
market
boost
the
ford
presidency
is
such
a
strange
historical
period
its
hard
to
know
what
to
make
of
the
stock
markets
relationship
to
the
white
house
in
those
years
after
taking
office
in
the
summer
of
1974
ford
labored
to
right
the
economy
campaigning
to
whip
inflation
now
but
never
seemed
completely
effective
ultimately
all
three
benefited
from
timing
too
the
ups
and
downs
of
business
are
just
as
important
to
the
stock
market
as
decisions
made
in
the
white
house
policies
are
important
but
timing
helps
an
administration
can
make
some
difference
at
the
margin
with
policies
says
john
carey
a
veteran
portfolio
manager
at
pioneer
investments
in
boston
but
i
think
its
the
business
cycle
that
drives
the
market
over
long
periods
of
time
timing
may
have
helped
the
stock
market
of
bill
clinton
who
arrived
in
and
departed
from
washington
under
ideal
economic
circumstances
and
perhaps
timing
hurt
president
bush
whose
terms
spanned
the
technology
stock
bust
the
sept
11
2001
terrorist
attacks
and
now
this
latest
financial
collapse
that
can
be
blamed
on
so
many
culpable
parties
today
financial
institutions
are
under
stress
around
the
world
companies
consumers
and
even
municipalities
find
it
harder
to
borrow
money
unemployment
is
rising
and
economists
worry
about
a
serious
recession
facing
all
that
obama
or
mccain
will
also
exercise
a
limited
power
over
the
direction
of
the
stock
market
but
their
timing
couldnt
be
better

unemployed

some

could
postpone

as
long
as
the
amount
deferred
each

was
no

or
about
635
the
offer
would
apply
to

of
up

and
could
affect
about

zapatero
said
the

will
underwrite
the
deferred
payments
which
may
be
spread
over
10

zapatero
said
spain
had
been
a
european
leader
in
terms
of
job
creation
in
the
last
decade
as
well
as
in
home
building
but
the

ground
to

hit

the
package
is
intended
to
bolster
growth
next
year
by
an
additional
percentage
point
to
around
4

and
was
announced
as
fresh

early

finished

highly
partisan
messages
they
have

the

asserted
that

are
siding
with
wall
street
barons
and
fortune
500
companies
over
middleclass
families
while

the

a

thats
what
theyre
all
about
my
friends
twice
in
one
speech
he
accused
obama
of
being
in
the
farleft
lane
of
american
politics
and
at
each
stop
took
aim
at
democratic
congressional
leaders
including
representative
barney
frank
of
newton
mass
as
readily
as
he
pointed
at
the
nominee
himself
watch
out
theyre
even
talking
about
taxing
your
401k
contributions
mccain
said
at

im
going

retirement
not
tax
it
im
going

protect

security
im
going

even
as

told
voters
it
was
time
to
move
beyond
the
old
arguments
between

and
democrats
that
have
generated
so
much
washington
gridlock
the
illinois
senator
drawing
on
the
central
plank
of
his
candidacy
sought
to
paint
mccain
as
an
outoftouch
republican
who
cared
more
about
the
wealthy
than
he
did
average
workers
at
his
first
rally
in
front
of
more
than
9000
people
at
jacksonvilles
veterans
memorial
arena
obama
hammered
mccain
anew
for
saying
in
the
same
setting
on
sept
15
that
the
fundamentals
of
our
economy
are
strong
that
day
more
than
5000
jobs
were
lost
more
than
7000
homes
were
foreclosed
on
said
obama
whose
stump
speech
was
repeatedly
interrupted
by
chants
of
obama
and
yes
we
can
the
day
before
former
fed
chairman
alan
greenspan
said
we
were
in
a
once
in
a
century
crisis
he
continued
florida
you
and
i
know
that
not
only
was
john
mccain
fundamentally
wrong
it
sums
up
the
fact
that
hes
out
of
touch
when
boos
filled
the
arena
obama
used
a
rejoinder
he
has
employed
at
nearly
every
rally
over
the
past
week
you
dont
need
to
boo
you
just
need
to
vote
the
backandforth
over
taxes
and
the
economy
is
one
of
several
familiar
disputes
that
mccain
and
obama

both
of
whom
portray
themselves
as
politicians
unburdened
by
the
usual
leftright
divides

have
sparred
over
throughout
their
campaign
the
candidates
have
veered
little
from
their
party
lines
on
trade
mccain
embraces
it
obama
wants
more
protections
for
american
workers
on
healthcare
mccain
favors
a
market
approach
obama
calls
for
more
government
involvement
and
on
foreign
policy
mccain
talks
tough
obama
emphasizes
diplomacy
but
if
their
policy
clashes
resemble
those
in
past
elections
their
battlefield
most
certainly
does
not
in
any
other
recent
presidential
contest
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
a
democratic
candidate
spending
the
eve
of
the
election
in
north
carolina
which
last
voted
for
a
democratic
presidential
candidate
32
years
ago
and
virginia
which
last
did
so
44
years
ago
but
polls
suggest
obama
has
a
shot
at
winning
both
states
and
he
hoped
a
final
exclamation
point
might
make
the
difference
monday
evening
obama
revved
up
about
25000
supporters
on
the
campus
of
the
university
of
north
carolinacharlotte
who
braved
pouring
rain
to
hear
his
lastminute
appeals
i
know
its
a
little
drizzly
and
youve
been
standing
here
getting
wet
he
said
thats
all
right

you
worth
it
a
woman
screamed
back
when
we
started
21
months
ago
obama
continued
i
didnt
know
how
it
would
turn
out
and
no
matter
what
happens

im
going
to
feel
good
about
how
its
turned
out
because
all
of
you
have
created
this
incredible
campaign
of
the
20
events
obama
held
in
the
final
full
week
of
campaigning
just
one

a
rally
outside

in

i
feel
pretty
peaceful
i
gotta
say
he
said
on
the
russ
parr
morning
show
because
my
attitude
is
if
weve
done
everything
we
can
do
then
its
up
to
the
people
to
decide
and
the
question
is
going
to
be
who
wants
it
more
and
i
hope
that
our

want
it

in

sean

were
sleeping
as
russell
worked
in

said
watterson
who
spoke
with
russell
cahalane
monday
morning
russell
cahalane
heard
a
noise
went
to
the
hallway
to
investigate
and
saw
smoke
watterson
said
he
and
linda
ran
outside
but
quickly
realized
that
sean
was
still
inside
they
saw
him
leaning
out
the
window
and
russell
screamed
at
him
to
keep
his
head
outside
and
breathe
fresh
air
sean
was
about
15
feet
from
the
ground
and
at
6
feet
5
inches
probably
could
have
jumped
without
hurting
himself
seriously
watterson
said
but
he
apparently
panicked
russell
cahalane
rushed
to
find
a
ladder
thats
when
his
wife
went
back
in
said
neighbor
susan
ngatha
who
called
911
when
russell
cahalane
returned
he
ran
inside
to
rescue
his
family
but
the
fire
and
smoke
were
too
intense
and
he
got
only
as
far
as
the
front
stairs
watterson
said
he
called
out
to
his
wife
and
at
first
she
answered
said
michelle
mooney
custeaus
fiancee
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
stopped
yelling
back
at
him
mooney
said
firefighters
found
the
two
near

bedroom
unconscious
they
did
not
seem
to
have
any
burns
said

chief
john

but
it
was
too
late
russell
cahalane
was
inconsolable
said
ngatha
even
now
it
still
hasnt
sunk
in
she
said
monday
friends
and
relatives
recalled
linda
cahalane
as
a
nurturing
mother
of
three
who
insisted
that
sean
stay
in
regular
classes
she
loved
watching
videos
with
him
mooney
said
they
were
big
fans
of
any
new
movie
that
came
out
sean
cahalane
who
graduated
from
whittier
regional
vocational
technical
high
school
in
2007
was
selfsufficient
and
independent
in
high
school
he
was
not
coordinated
enough
to
play
sports
but
he
loved
being
around
athletes
and
became
the
football
teams
equipment
manager
setting
up
cones
for
practice
drills
and
fixing
broken
helmets
in
return
the
players
would
drive
him
to
the
teams
friday
night
spaghetti
dinners
he
meant
so
much
to
the
kids
said
the
schools
athletic
director
kevin
bradley
in
a
statement
released
by
the
school
they
are
all
crying
he
never
played
a
down
but
he
touched
every
one
of
their
lives
after
graduation
sean
cahalane
took
a
few
marketing
classes
at
northern
essex
community
college
but
had
a
hard
time
keeping
up
and
worked
for
a
while
instead
mooney
said
he
could
not
drive
because
he
was
prone
to
seizures
so
he
would
bike
or
walk
the
2
miles
to
market
basket
he
would
help
women
with
children
lug
groceries
to
their
cars
and
would
go
out
of
his
way
to
lift
heavy
objects
so
that
others
would
not
have
to
said
ronald
savage
a
store
manager
though
he
towered
over
most
people
he
was
incredibly
disarming
said
watterson
every
time
i
would
see
him
at
market
basket
he
would
walk
away
from
whatever
he
was
doing
and
give
me
a
huge
hug
watterson
said
id
get
a
face
full
of

google
and
yahoo
have
offered
to
significantly
narrow
the
scope
of
a
planned
advertising
partnership
in
a
lastminute
effort
to
win
the
approval
of
the
justice
department
which
is
scrutinizing
the
deal
for
its
effect
on
competition
a
person
briefed
on
the
revised
plan
said
on
monday
the
advertising
deal
calls
for
google
to
place
ads
next
to
some
web
search
results
on
yahoo
lifting
yahoos
revenue
under
the
revised
terms
the
deal
would
be
shortened
to
two
years
from
as
many
as
10
said
the
person
who
agreed
to
speak
only
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
the
discussions
remained
confidential
in
addition
the
amount
that
yahoo
could
earn
from
ads
placed
by
google
would
be
capped
at
25
percent
of
yahoos
search
advertising
revenue
the
person
said
previously
yahoo
had
the
discretion
to
decide
how
much
of
its
search
ads
to
turn
over
to
google
google
and
yahoo
submitted
the
new
proposal
to
the
justice
department
over
the
weekend
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
limitations
will
be
enough
to
satisfy
antitrust
investigators
who
have
raised
objections
to
the
planned
partnership
representatives
for
yahoo
and
google
declined
to
comment
on
the
new
proposal
but
said
that
discussions
with
the
justice
department
were
continuing
gina
talamona
a
department
spokeswoman
said
the
matter
was
pending
but
declined
to
comment
further
the
proposed
limits
on
the
partnership
if
accepted
by
regulators
would
most
likely
reduce
the
financial
benefits
of
the
deal
for
yahoo
which
has
been
struggling
to
accelerate
its
growth
in
the
wake
of
failed
merger
talks
with
microsoft
the
company
has
said
it
hopes
to
receive
250
million
to
450
million
in
additional
operating
cash
flow
from
the
agreement
in
its
first
year
for
google
a
more
limited
deal
would
also
be
a
setback
but
would
most
likely
be
worth
pursuing
if
it
averted
a
showdown
with
regulators
over
the
companys
growing
power
groups
representing
some
of
the
nation
largest
advertisers
who
are
googles
most
important
customers
have
said
that
the
deal
could
reduce
competition
lead
to
higher
prices
and
strengthen
its
dominance
of
the
search
advertising
market
one
critic
of
the
deal
said
that
the
revisions
would
do
nothing
to
make
the
agreement
more
palatable
to
advertisers
if
a
deal
cant
survive
longterm
scrutiny
whats
the
benefit
of
allowing
it
for
the
short
term
said
robert
d
liodice
president
of
the
association
of
national
advertisers
which
has
urged
the
justice
department
to
oppose
the
deal
the
companies
have
said
that
the
deal
would
actually
be
good
for
competition
and
that
they
do
not
control
ad
prices
which
are
set
through
auctions
a
cap
on
the
percentage
of
revenue
that
yahoo
could
earn
would
ensure
that
it
would
not
use
the
deal
to
slowly
exit
the
search
advertising
market

a
situation
that
some
advertisers
said
was
likely
and
that
would
give
google
a
virtual
monopoly
on
the
largest
and
most
profitable
portion
of
the
online
advertising
business
the
new
proposal
came
as
the
discussions
between
the
companies
and
the
justice
department
appeared
to
have
run
their
course
a
resolution

either
a
decision
by
the
department
to
file
a
suit
to
block
the
deal
a
decision
by
the
companies
to
walk
away
from
it
or
a
lastminute
agreement

was
expected
this
week
google
and
yahoo
announced
their
planned
partnership
in
june
they
agreed
to
delay
it
until
early
october
to
give
regulators
time
to
review
it
since
then
the
companies
have
postponed
the
start
of
the
deal
repeatedly
news
of
the
revised
proposal
was
first
reported
on
the
web
site
of
the
wall
street
journal
he
is
an
enormously
popular
candonowrong
player
in
the
eyes
of
his
constituents
who
have
anointed
him
as
the
ultimate
counterculture
player

suit
necktie
tie
shoes
you
crazy

but
allen
iverson
is
just
a
basketball
commodity
to
the
basketball
establishment
and
now
he
has
been
traded
for
a
second
time
in
less
than
two
years
the
answer
is
what
his
adoring
public
calls
him
well
todays
question
is
can
you
win
a
championship
with
allen
iverson
as
your
best
player
thus
far
the
answer
is
no
and
ai
is
now
33
this
means
he
is
a
past
his
physical
peak
and
b
set
in
his
ways
there
is
a
chance
im
wrong
about
the
first
one
but
there
isnt
much
doubt
about
the
second
one
iverson
has
been
traded
from
the
denver
nuggets
to
the
detroit
pistons
a
team
that
needs
a
change
of
something
call
it
change
of
pace
call
it
what
you
wish
but
it
was
evident
by
their
play
against
the
celtics
in
the
2008
playoffs
that
the
window
for
that
core
group
had
closed
a
team
that
had
the
talent
and
knowledge
to
win
multiple
championships
was
going
to
hold
itself
to
just
one
title
for
reasons
the
rest
of
us
will
never
know
what
is
shocking
about
this
transaction
is
the
sobering
thought
that
the
pistons
have
coldbloodedly
acquired
him
with
a
larger
idea
in
mind
can
allen
iverson
deal
with
the
idea
that
he
has
not
really
been
brought
to
auburn
hills
to
help
the
pistons
win
an
nba
championship
that
he
is
in
addition
to
being
an
experienced
player
of
note
that
most
desirable
of
nba
items
an
expiring
contract
oh
the
indignity
but
that
is
the
immediate
assumption
the
experts
are
making
detroit
general
manager
joe
dumars
has
acquired
allen
iverson
as
much
for
his
contract
as
his
skill
iversons

wow
this
is
year
13
for
ai
which
hardly
seems
possible
does
it
it
seems
like
yesterday
that
carmelo
travieso
and
edgar
padilla
were
schooling
iverson
and
victor
page
in
the
1996
ncaa
eastern
regionals
down
there
in
atlanta
that
was
a
glorious
day
for
umass
but
we
all
knew
iverson
was
headed
for
nba
fame
and
glory
regardless
of
what
took
place
in
the
georgia
dome
that
sunday
afternoon
but
how
will
history
treat
allen
iverson
the
barebones
are
that
he
is
a
rookie
of
the
year
199697
a
threetime
firstteam
allnba
player
a
threetime
scoring
leader
a
threetime
steals
leader
and
an
mvp
200001
he
got
to
the
nba
finals
once
in
2001
against
the
lakers
and
his
76ers
were
simply
beaten
by
a
better
team
he
is
a
twotime
allstar
game
mvp
2001
2005
with
a
high
of
35
pretty
good
for
6
feet
1
inch
if
that
huh
yes
it
is
allen
iverson
is
one
of
the
most
intriguing
players
in
the
history
of
the
nba
there
have
been
little
guys
equally
quick
and
there
have
been
little
guys
nate
archibald
for
example
who
could
match
his
ability
to
both
score
and
pass
but
the
thing
he
will
be
remembered
for
is
his
sheer
physical
toughness
the
only
players
his
size
i
know
of
who
have
ever
approached
iversons
fearlessness
and
ability
to
play
in
pain
were
kc
jones
and
norm
van
lier
and
neither
was
anywhere
near
the
total
ballplayer
allen
iverson
has
been
neither
kc
nor
stormin
could
have
led
this
league
in
scoring
even
if
they
had
been
allowed
to
count
all
their
pregame
layups
all
of
us
who
love
basketball
have
been
thrilled
by
allen
iversons
extraordinary
tenacity
and
virtuosity
but
the
eternal
issue
with
all
extraordinary
virtuosos
in
this
game
whether
they
be
7foot
scoringmachine
centers
such
as
wilt
chamberlain
and
kareem
abduljabbar
midsize
doitalls
such
as
michael
jordan
ok
specifically
michael
jordan
or
small
multiskilled
guards
such
as
archibald
isiah
thomas
or
allen
iverson
is
how
to
blend
that
dominating
talent
with
the
other
four
people
in
order
to
best
help
a
team
win
basketball
games
and
eventually
championships
it
is
basketballs
great
conundrum
a
man
can
indeed
have
too
much
talent
in
iversons
case
the
entire
package
includes
a
very
specific
personal
background
that
has
shaped
him
into
a
very
rigid
adult
he
embraces
a
culture
that
very
often
irritates
the
basketball
establishment
it
permeates
everything
he
does
from
the
way
he
dresses
to
the
way
he
plays
the
game
and
being
61
is
a
major
problem
the
61
player
who
can
affect
basketball
in
the
long
run
the
way
the
great
centers
and
the
great
midsize
players
such
as
bird
magic
and
michael
did
has
not
yet
been
born
as
talented
as
allen
iverson
is
there
is
only
so
much
a
61
guy
can
do
im
not
sure
allen
iverson
will
ever
be
at
peace
with
that
concept
the
fact
that
he
has
not
won
a
championship
since
high
school
is
not
his
fault
it
is
a
testament
to
the
game
of
basketball
pure
point
guards
fitting
a
specific
team
need
in
a
given
point
in
time
help
teams
win
championships
this
is
what
oscar
robertson
and
tiny
archibald
did
for
the
1971
bucks
and
1981
celtics
respectively
they
were
each
very
toneddown
versions
of
their
careerpeak
physical
selves
when
they
won
their
rings
but
allen
iverson
has
yet
to
make
that
transition
could
he
theoretically
yes
if
he
did
so
could
he
make
detroit
a
champion
im
not
sure
the
pistons
are
that
close
but
for
the
sake
of
argument
lets
say
yes
again
theoretically
does
he
have
any
idea
what
im
talking
about
i
doubt
it
i
bet
joe
dumars
doubts
it
too
but
hes
going
to
enjoy
allen
iversons
expiring
contract

the
mood
in
the
patriots
locker
room
following
their
hardfought
and
hardluck
1815
loss
to
the
indianapolis
colts
sunday
night
was
understandably
funereal
it
would
be
human
nature
to
dwell
on
what
could
have
beenshould
have
been
against
the
colts
but
the
patriots
dont
have
time
to
wallow
in
pigskin
selfpity
with
next
to
no
contributions
from
their
projected
starting
backfield
of
quarterback
tom
brady
and
running
back
laurence
maroney
both
of
whom
are
done
for
the
season
the
patriots
sit
at
53
halfway
through
the
season
locked
in
a
threeway
tie
with
the
buffalo
bills
and
new
york
jets
for
first
place
in
the
afc
east
this
sundays
crucial
game
at
home
against
the
bills
kicks
off
a
stretch
of
three
straight
division
games
for
the
patriots
after
the
bills
new
england
plays
the
jets
on
a
thursday
night
nov
13
at
gillette
stadium
and
then
travels
to
miami
to
face
the
dolphins
nov
23
those
games
will
go
a
long
way
in
deciding
whether
the
patriots
can
win
a
sixth
straight
afc
east
title
any
anger
over
playing
perfect
stall
ball
on
offense
and
limiting
peyton
manning
and
the
colts
to
18
points
on
defense
but
still
losing
has
to
be
left
in
the
locker
room
at
lucas
oil
stadium
or
the
patriots
will
be
left
behind
in
the
afc
east
you
got
to
take
it
for
what
it
is

were
still
53
said
cornerback
ellis
hobbs
following
sunday
nights
loss
we
go
from
here
we
continue
to
play
weve
got
an
eightgame
season
we
have
some
division
games
coming
up
it
hurts
right
now
but
its
just
like
a
win
i
take
it
for
what
it
is
today
then
tomorrow
its
out
of
my
system
the
patriots
have
dominated
the
afc
east
since
2001
winning
five
straight
titles
and
six
of
seven
their
3610
record
783
winning
percentage
in
divisional
play
since
2001
is
the
best
in
the
nfl
but
this
year
is
different
the
balance
of
power
in
the
division
shifted
the
moment
chiefs
safety
bernard
pollard
plowed
into
bradys
left
knee
in
the
season
opener
while
the
bills
jets
and
patriots
are
tied
for
the
lead
miami
which
already
has
beaten
the
patriots
this
season
is
just
a
game
back
at
44
i
think
all
three
of
those
are
good
football
teams
said
coach
bill
belichick
we
certainly
knew
about
the
jets
and
miami
that
wasnt
any
surprise
the
way
that
buffalo
has
been
built
with
the
job
that
coach
dick
jauron
has
done
there
and
getting
a
lot
of
young
talented
players
on
their
team
and
how
explosive
they
are
in
the
return
game
on
special
teams
and
offensively
with
lee
evans
all
the
other
receivers
and
marshawn
lynch
at
running
back
defensively
their
speed
and
quickness
up
front
with
some
talented
guys
in
the
secondary
it
doesnt
surprise
me
that
they
have
won
five
games
no
the
bills
may
present
the
greatest
challenge
to
the
patriots
afc
east
supremacy
they
are
wellcoached
by
jauron
they
have
an
explosive
wide
receiver
in
evans
who
is
averaging
194
yards
per
catch
a
talented
running
back
in
lynch
and
a
quality
quarterback
in
trent
edwards
who
in
his
second
season
out
of
stanford
has
cemented
himself
as
one
of
the
games
good
young
qbs
as
if
the
bills
needed
any
added
motivation
they
have
lost
two
straight
games
after
a
51
start
both
losses
coming
in
the
division
working
in
the
patriots
favor
is
that
the
bills
could
be
without
safety
donte
whitner
who
suffered
a
separated
right
shoulder
sunday
against
the
jets
and
defensive
end
aaron
schobel
a
passrushing
patriots
tormentor
who
has
a
torn
tendon
in
his
left
foot
and
has
missed
the
last
three
games
belichick
knows
the
task
his
team
faces
i
have
kind
of
kept
an
eye
on
buffalo
said
belichick
they
have
played
a
lot
of
teams
that
we
have
played
so
we
have
seen
them
to
some
degree
but
now
is
really
when
we
start
zeroing
in
on
them
thats
good
because
the
rest
of
the
division
teams
are
zeroing
in
on
the
patriots
and
they
dont
care
what
happened
against
the
colts
that
means
the
patriots
must
take
kevin
faulks
failed
2point
conversion
rush
david
thomass
untimely
unnecessary
roughness
penalty
and
all
the
other
whatifs
from
sundays
loss
and
toss
them
out
of
their
minds
indianapolis
is
over
but
the
drive
for
a
division
title
is
in
full
gear
after
a
loss
like
this
you
can
feel
bad
but
at
the
same
time
we
still
have
a
lot
of
football
left
the
second
half
of
the
season
so
well
see
each
other
wednesday
and
get
back
to
work

sharna
fey
and
kim
broadbeck
have
gotten
married
three
times
in
2004
they
married
in
a
daze
in
2005
they
married
on
an
island
and
on
monday
when
it
really
counted
under
the
law
they
married
in
a
hurry
were
doing
this
while
we
still
can
said
fey
a
44yearold
life
coach
who
has
been
with
broadbeck
for
11
years
and
through
two
previous
samesex
marriage
ceremonies
neither
recognized
as
legal
i
mean
trust
me
we
feel
married
but
this
is
a
legal
response
they
were
not
alone
with
polls
showing
the
outcome
of
a
ballot
measure
tuesday
on
outlawing
samesex
marriage
in
california
a
tossup
couples
were
not
taking
any
chances
on
monday
they
showed
up
early
here
at

city
hall
donning
boutonnieres
and
blouses
and
holding
each
others
hands

and
their

near
los

john
duran
a
city
councilman
said
he
had
performed
a
whopping
25
ceremonies
since
friday
driving
all
over
los
angeles
county
to
officiate
this
is
the
modern
day
version
of
a
shotgun
wedding
said
duran
were
doing
as
many
as
we
can
before
tomorrow
the
rush
to
the
altar
was
in
anticipation
of
proposition
8
which
would
amend
the
state
constitution
to
define
marriage
as
between
a
man
and
a
woman
and
end
nearly
five
months
of
legalized
samesex
marriages
in
the
state
the
ban
if
approved
would
take
effect
wednesday
were
here
in
case
of
what
happens
tomorrow
said
michael
levy
who
married
his
partner
michael
golden
in
san
francisco
on
monday
both
wearing
identical
tuxedo
jackets
ties
and
beards
im
scared
its
really
close
while
defeat
of
the
california
ballot
measure
would
probably
quell
debate

at
least
for
a
time

over
allowing
samesex
unions
in
the
state
it
is
expected
that
a
victory
would
lead
to
a
secondround
of
legal
wrangling
this
time
over
the
validity
of
the
thousands
marriages
performed
since
june
when
a
state
supreme
court
decision
legalizing
samesex
marriages
took
effect
the
california
attorney
general
jerry
brown
has
indicated
that
he
would
uphold
the
marriages
but
geoff
kors
the
executive
director
of
equality
california
a
gay
rights
group
opposing
proposition
8
said
he
expects
challenges
if
they
lose
it
wouldnt
surprise
me
that
people
trying
to
eliminate
constitutional
rights
would
try
to
annul
or
divorce
people
that
are
married
said
kors
who
nonetheless
expressed
optimism
that
the
ballot
measure
would
fail
it
ought
to
be
a
seminal
moment
as
a
new
president
takes
office
in
washington
the
czech
republic
assumes
the
rotating
presidency
of
the
european
union
the
first
former
soviet
bloc
country
to
lead
the
group
of
470
million
europeans
and
during
one
of
the
worst
economic
conflagrations
in
a
century
but
instead
of
welcoming
the
opportunity
for
this
country
of
10
million
to
shepherd
the
worlds
biggest
trading
bloc
the
fiery
czech
president
vaclav
klaus
has
invoked
the
munich
agreement
of
1938
when
the
european
powers
helped
to
carve
up
czechoslovakia
he
said
in
late
october
that
the
czech
presidency
would
be
insignificant
since
europe
now
as
then
was
controlled
by
france
germany
italy
and
britain
czech
politicians
he
warned
should
not
think
they
could
change
anything
like
their
central
european
neighbors
czechs
have
spent
centuries
straddling
the
continents
eastwest
divide
pushed
and
pulled
between

and

or

the
prospect
come
jan
1
of
six
months
at
the
helm
of
the
european
union
at
a
sensitive
point
in
history
seems
to
have
brought
out
national
neuroses
from
the
past
the
centerright
government
of
prime
minister
mirek
topolanek
is
teetering
badly
after
huge
losses
in
recent
regional
elections
prompting
alarm
that
the
european
union
could
be
led
by
a
rudderless
nation
meanwhile
with
russia
having
flexed
a
new
set
of
muscles
over
georgia
some
european
diplomats
question
whether
this
nation
is
up
to
taming
its
former
master
some
in
france
current
holder
of
the
presidency
are
so
alarmed
that
officials
there
have
suggested
bypassing
the
czech
republic
and
extending
the
french
presidency
into
next
year
clearly
piqued
the
czech
foreign
minister
karel
schwarzenberg
a
pipesmoking
prince
joked
that
if
france
did
not
step
aside
then
he
would
have
to
challenge
nicolas
sarkozy
its
president
to
a
duel
the
french
and
mr
sarkozy
do
not
want
to
part
with
being
the
president
of
europe
schwarzenberg
said
during
an
interview
on
friday
sarkozy
offered
a
belated
pledge
of
support
the
diplomatic
wrangling
has
echoes
of
2003
when
former
communist
countries
including
the
czech
republic
supported
the
usled
war
in
iraq
prompting
jacques
chirac
then
president
of
france
to
remark
that
they
needed
to
learn
to
shut
up
europe
is
more
united
now
but
a
new
divide
nevertheless
threatens
to
emerge
predicated
in
part
on
divergent
approaches
to
steering
economic
policy
during
perilous
financial
times
under
the
czechs
some
fear
a
renewed
battle
over
which
economic
model
should
dominate
the
european
union
the
social
market
economy
favored
by
its
newest
members
or
the
statecontrolled
economy
increasingly
championed
by
france
while
sarkozy
has
earned
praise
for
helping
to
engineer
a
speedy
bailout
of
european
banks
prague
remains
deeply
wary
of
state
intervention
klaus
an
economist
by
training
recently
equated
sarkozys
methods
to
old
socialism
while
topolanek
the
prime
minister
has
argued
that
state
support
for
collapsing
banks
runs
counter
to
the
european
unions
free
market
principles
the
czech
republics
refusal
to
embrace
the
euro
even
as
its
poorer
cousin
slovakia
moves
to
adopt
it
in
january
has
prompted
some
observers
to
argue
that
a
country
outside
the
euro
zone
is
not
wellsuited
to
guide
the
bloc
during
a
global
recession
tomas
sedlacek
chief
economist
at
csob
the
largest
czech
bank
contended
that
the
czech
republic
would
not
be
the
most
empathetic
leader
since
the
government
had
pumped
cash
into
faltering
czech
banks
in
the
late
1990s
which
was
now
shielding
them
from
the
liquidity
crisis
in
a
group
where
everyone
has
a
headache
you
dont
want
to
follow
the
one
guy
who
says
his
head
feels
fine
he
said
but
schwarzenberg
the
foreign
minister
argued
that
the
czech
republic
was
not
immune
to
the
financial
crisis
because
of
deep
integration
with
the
euro
zone
more
than
threequarters
of
czech
exports
go
to
the
european
union
while
the
manufacturing
sector
in
the
country
is
suffering
as
for
the
contention
that
the
czechs
might
be
ill
equipped
to
guide
policy
toward
the
kremlin
schwarzenberg
argued
that
40
years
under
soviet
domination
had
not
gone
unnoticed
we
have
some
experience
with
the
russians
he
said
wryly
czech
ambivalence
toward
the
european
union
stems
in
part
from
instinctive
distrust
for
europe
and
loyalty
to
the
united
states
conditioned
during
decades
of
invasion
and
occupation
jan
hamacek
a
social
democrat
who
heads
the
foreign
affairs
committee
in
parliament
said
czechs
remembered
that
americans
had
rescued
them
and
the
rest
of
europe
three
times
in
the
20th
century

in
world
wars
i
and
ii
and

his

prime

creation
in

as
well
as

the

has
ground

deflated

crisis
hit

south

which
has
been
hit
hard
by

the
package
is
intended
to
bolster
growth
next
year
by
an
additional
percentage
point
to

and
was
announced
as
fresh

had
slowed
to
its
lowest
pace
in

months
weak
economic

business
travelers
of
all
political
affiliations
reported
an
unusual
amount
of
political
conversation
in
the
last
few
months

some
of
it
rather
pointed

from
airplane
seatmates
fellow
guests
diners
and
even
associates
its
almost
like
theyre
looking
for
a
reaction
said
barry
goldberg
an
executive
coach
who
regularly
flies
for
work
he
said
that
he
had
had
numerous
conversations

not
always
pleasant

with
fellow
travelers
who
wanted
to
talk
politics
on
a
flight
from
atlanta
to
new
york
in
midaugust
goldberg
said
his
seatmate
addressed
him
as
he
read
a
copy
of
the
financial
times
the
opening
salvo
was
oh
that
pink
paper
whats
the
matter

you
cant
read
an
american
paper
goldberg
recalled
the
reference
being
to
the
papers
salmoncolored
newsprint
he
said
he
replied
that
he
worked
frequently
in
europe
and
tried
to
keep
up
on
global
economic
affairs
after
the
safety
announcements
he
said
youre
one
of
those
people
whos
going
to
vote
for
obama
right
youre
probably
one
of
those
people
who
thinks
we
ought
to
talk
to
iran
goldberg
said
adding
that
he
told
the
man
he
did
not
want
to
talk
about
politics
and
opened
his
laptop
to
no
avail
this
guy
didnt
give
it
up
he
said
while
encounters
with
strangers
may
be
awkward
it
is
far
more
fraught
to
have
such
an
exchange
with
a
colleague
or
superior
while
on
the
road
lindsay
griffiths
an
administrative
staff
member
for
a
legal
association
found
that
out
at
her
organizations
annual
meeting
in
june
when
one
lawyer
took
umbrage
with
her
stance
on
the
iraq
war
as
they
were
gathered
with
a
group
at
the
hotel
bar
he
was
pointing
his
finger
in
my
face
he
really
thought
the
higher
he
raised
his
voice
the
more
likely
i
was
to
go
over
to
his
side
the
lawyers
wife
eventually
stepped
in
and
changed
the
subject
and
griffiths
excused
herself
some
business
travelers
said
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
avoid
these
confrontations
going
so
far
as
to
hurry
through
a
meal
in
a
restaurant
or
cut
short
their
time
at
the
hotel
spa
but
then
there
is
laurie
riedman
owner
of
a
marketing
firm
who
said
she
had
been
stopped
four
times
over
the
course
of
a
single
crosscountry
journey
in
september
by
travelers
who
remarked
that
she
looked
like
sarah
palin
the
republican
vice
presidential
nominee
it
was
bizarre
to
me
i
happen
to
be
an
obama
supporter
and
i
think
people
thought
they
were
giving
me
a
huge
compliment
she
said
riedman
said
the
resemblance
was
superficial
she
has
brown
hair
with
bangs
and
rectangular
glasses
and
on
that
day
happened
to
be
wearing
a
suit
with
her
hair
in
an
updo
for
bryce
gruber
being
visibly
pregnant
attracted
comments
and
admonishments
from
fellow
travelers
on
both
the
right
and
the
left
on
a
recent
flight
from
new
york
to
fort
lauderdale
fla
her
seatmate
who
identified
herself
as
a
doctor
told
gruber
it
was
her
responsibility
to
vote
for
barack
obama
if
she
cared
about
the
health
of
her
unborn
child
it
was
an
early
morning
flight
she
said
i
just
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
conversation
on
a
car
trip
to
a
meeting
in
philadelphia
gruber
said
she
was
stopped
at
a
highway
rest
area
by
another
traveler
the
guy
next
to
me
saw
i
had
florida
plates
on
my
car
and
said
oh
you
must
be
a
mccain
fan
and
then
he
started
praising
me
while
few
are
willing
to
admit
that
they
argue
politics
with
strangers
on
the
road
jennifer
kushell
conceded
that
she
had
started
a
few
spirited
discussions
ive
been
a
lot
more
aggressive
in
my
comments
than
i
think
ive
ever
been
in
the
past
she
said
as
the
president
of
a
networking
and
career
counseling
web
site
for
college
students
a
job
that
involves
flying
about
100000
miles
a
year
she
teaches
that
politics
is
a
topic
to
be
avoided
while
in
professional
company
to
admit
im
talking
about
this
kills
me
because
its
against
my
policy
she
said
although
not
the
brunt
of
hostility
noah
cole
said
he
had
found
himself
in
an
uncomfortable
situation
on
a
flight
on
united
in
october
when
the
flight
attendant
came
to
take
drink
orders
cole
noticed
that
the
attendant
had
an
obama
sticker
on
his
uniform
the
sticker
was
also
noticed
by
his
seatmate
who
challenged
the
attendant
and
asked
why
he
was
supporting
him
when
the
attendant
demurred
and
left
to
get
the
beverages
cole
said
his
seatmate
turned
to
him
next
the
guy
looked
at
me
and
said
he
must
be
gay
and
thats
why
hes
supporting
obama
i
didnt
know
how
to
respond
he
said
he
had
considered
himself
a
good
judge
of
his
fellow
travelers
beforehand
but
now
unless
its
an
outward
sign
like
a
button
ive
learned
not
to
assume
anything
christopher
federico
director
of
the
center
for
the
study
of
political
psychology
at
the
university
of
minnesota
said
that
the
anonymity
of
travel
might
lead
some
to
think
of
themselves
in
terms
of
the
groups
they
support

including
political
parties

instead
of
as
individuals
theres
a
lot
of
research
to
suggest
that
people
behave
in
unique
ways
when
there
is
anonymity

said
when
people
are
traveling

2008
and
director
of
the

at

university
were
in
a
sort
of
suspended
life
and
maybe
that
makes
us
feel
that
the
rules
of
decent
engagement
are
suspended
as
well
the
wait
for
a
publicly
traded
kohlberg
kravis
roberts
just
grew
a
little
longer
the
company
a
private
equity
firm
said
on
monday
that
it
was
delaying
the
purchase
of
a
publicly
listed
affiliate
until
next
year
amid
the
turmoil
troubling
the
markets
kohlberg
executives
said
the
rescheduling
was
a
result
of
complications
arising
from
the
merger
which
would
combine
the
firm
with
the
affiliate
kkr
private
equity
investors
which
is
traded
on
the
euronext
exchange
in
amsterdam
netherlands
the
investment
thesis
for
the
transaction
is
solid
george
r
roberts
a
founder
of
kohlberg
said
on
a
call
with
analysts
on
monday
we
remain
committed
to
completing
the
transaction
the
news
was
the
latest
bump
in
kohlbergs
quest
to
start
trading
in
the
public
markets
a
process
started
at
the
height
of
the
private
equity
boom
in
july
2007
first
the
firm
sought
an
initial
offering
following
in
the
footsteps
of
fortress
investment
group
and
the
blackstone
group
with
the
credit
squeeze
though
kohlberg
and
its
peers
have
suffered
as
they
have
been
cut
off
from
dealmaking
the
source
of
their
previously
lavish
profits
last
july
kohlberg
said
it
would
go
public
by
acquiring
the
88
percent
of
kkr
private
equity
investors
that
it
did
not
already
own
and
by
relisting
21
percent
of
the
combined
companys
shares
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
unlike
in
the
blackstone
or
fortress
offerings
none
of
kohlbergs
top
executives
will
cash
out
through
the
deal
the
affiliates
earnings
shed
some
light
on
how
kohlbergs
companies
are
performing
an
unusual
amount
of
disclosure
for
buyout
firms
which
are
often
secretive
the
fund
which
invests
in
kohlbergs
private
equity
funds
as
well
as
several
companies
owned
by
the
buyout
firm
said
its
assets
value
fell
153
percent
to
387
billion
in
the
third
quarter
the
total
return
for
private
equity
investors
for
the
year
through
sept
30
was
negative
226
percent
slightly
worse
than
the
standard
ampamp
poors
500stock
index
or
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
have
performed
over
the
same
period
while
private
equity
investors
said
the
value
of
some
investments
like
its
stake
in
the
hospital
operator
hca
owned
by
kohlberg
rose
most
of
its
other
holdings
declined
its
investment
in
bonds
of
sun
microsystems
for
example
fell
about
11
percent
from
the
second
quarter
to
511
million
other
stakes
mostly
in
european
companies
declined
in
part
because
of
fluctuations
in
foreign
exchange
rates
analysts
have
grown
increasingly
concerned
that
companies
owned
by
buyout
firms
which
on
average
carry
higher
debt
burdens
may
struggle
more
than
their
peers
as
the
economy
worsens
but
on
the
conference
call
kohlberg
executives
said
that
threequarters
of
the
firms
portfolio
companies
were
performing
well
furthermore
the
firms
representatives
said
that
many
of
the
companies
had
flexible
terms
on
their
debt
repayment
private
equity
investors
also
said
that
the
value
of
its
investment
in
kohlbergs
private

funds
fell
with
the
exception
of
its
stake

these

extraordinary
times

the
buyers
are
out
there
he
said
there
are
just
not
as
many
haroon
also
said
falling
gas
prices
may
be
enticing
buyers
to
again
consider
buying
pickup
trucks
and
suvs
of
the
69

hamer
sold

more

more

looking

haroon
said
its
going
to
happen
thats
just
the
kind
of
cycle
we
go
through
haroon
and
other
dealers
said
theyre
also
working
to
sell
used
vehicles
and
2008
models
to
make
way
for
the
2009
models
that
are
unveiled
each
fall
despite
the
slow
october
sales
industry
executives
said
most
dealers
have
adjusted
orders
to
keep
inventory
levels
manageable
manufacturers
in
turn
have
been
slowing
production
for
example
north
american
automakers
assembled
16
percent
fewer
vehicles
in
the
third
quarter
with
detroits
big
three
cutting
production
by
23
percent
george
pipas
fords
top
sales
analyst
said
dealers
factor
economic
conditions
into
their
newcar
orders
things
are
quite
slow
now
but
things
were
slowing
down
earlier
this
year
he
said
it
wasnt
like
the
economy
was
motoring
along
on
all
cylinders
tom

said
the
pasadenabased
company
sells
about
1000
vehicles
a
month
and
is
doing
ok
despite
the
tough
economy
we
are
staying
ahead
of
the
curve
and
growing
our
business
he
said
in
fact
rusnak
which
sells
luxury
brands
at
12

across

california
is
completing
a
220000squarefoot
sixlevel
bmw
dealership
at
the
thousand

auto
mall
that
is
slated
to
open
next
month
i
also
think
it
helps
we
are
located
in
upscale
areas
like
pasadena
and
westlake
village
they
are
very
strong
areas
to
do
business

in

1980s
against

guilty
on

in

to

the

with
stuart
levine
a

black
during
a
racially
charged
chapter
of
chicago
history
known
as
the

vrdolyak
and
his
28
allies
used
their
majority
on
the
50member
city
council
to
block
washingtons
proposals
and
appointments
until
a
federal

ordered
special

for

that
were
remapped
to
reflect
the

before
surprising
many
by
switching
to
the

in
1989
days
before
the

primary
vrdolyak
announced
himself
as

said
dick

a

science
at

university
of
illinois
at
chicago
referring
to
the
racial
divisiveness
and
corruption
that
have
characterized

here
and
hopefully
we
will
have
a
different
history
in
the
future
prosecutors
recommended
that
vrdolyak
serve
41
months
his
lawyer
michael
monico
said
he
would
ask
for
less
the
fact
that
this
brings
closure
to
this
case
monico
said
is
very
meaningful
to
the
family
vrdolyak
was
not
available
for
comment
he
apparently
left
court
through
a
back
exit
at
times
he
slouched
in

crossing

uncrossing

as
the

sat
about
15
feet
away
staring
at
him
patrice

accused

of
plantation
politics
and
patti
hagan
a
writer
decried
his
strongarmed
knucklebusting
tactics
custom
at
city
hall
has
long
allowed
anyone
to
appear
at
a
bill
signing
and
offer
an
opinion
on
the
legislation
being
enacted
most
such
ceremonies
are
sleepy
affairs
that
attract
a
handful
of
political
gadflies
but
on
monday
this
tidy
ritual
was
turned
on
its
head
for
four
uninterrupted
hours
scores
of
new
yorkers
walked
up
to
a
microphone
looked
at
bloomberg
and
rendered
a
blunt
verdict
on
the
legislation
that
would
allow
him
to
seek
a
third
term
it
was
a
singular
moment
in
the
bloomberg
era
of
government
for
much
of
his
tenure
the
mayor
has
been
showered
with
accolades
and
surrounded
by
friendly
crowds
that
have
treated
him
like
a
head
of
state
but
during
the
bill
signing
a
man
unaccustomed
to
direct
public
criticism
endured
a
heavy

and
very
harsh

dose
of
it
from
those
he
governs
dozens
of
speakers
accused
the
mayor
of
arrogantly
disregarding
the
will
of
new
york
voters
who
overwhelmingly
endorsed
the
current
eightyear
term
limits
in
two
referendums
in
the
1990s
there
were
many
voices
of
support
too

from
average
new
yorkers
elected
officials
and
union
heads

and
bloomberg
appeared
relieved
when
they
spoke
of
his
proven
leadership
and
financial
resume
you
have
everything
well
oiled
and
i
would
like
you
to
sign
this
so
the
people
of
new
york
city
have
a
choice
to
keep
you
in
office
said
jill
whitaker
a
personal
assistant
in
manhattan
patrick
j
egan
an
assistant
professor
of
politics
at
new
york
university
called
the
legislation
extending
term
limits
to
12
years
a
great
step
for
democracy
in
new
york
city
in
all
137
people
spoke

68
against
the
legislation
and
65
for
it
according
to
a
tally
by
the
new
york
times
four
people
did
not
make
their
preferences
known
one
man
simply
brandished
a
copy
of
his
resume
and
asked
the
billionaire
mayor
for
a
job
with
a
sixfigure
salary
but
it
was
the
opponents
who
brought
the
most
passion

and
raw
anger

to
the
stately
setting
many
put
their
opposition
in
intensely
personal
terms
saying
that
a
mayor
whom
they
admired

and
had
voted
for

had
let
them
down
by
seeking
to
circumvent
voters
you
have
exploited
the
power
of
your
office
to
overturn
the
express
will
of
the
people
said
judi
polson
of
the
upper
west
side
despite
calling
herself
a
bloomberg
supporter
polson
a
former
wall
street
executive
vowed
to
vote
against
the
mayor
in
the
next
race
he
has
lost
my
vote
she
told
a
reporter
on
her
way
out
another
bloomberg
admirer
michael
rosen
told
bloomberg
he
had
voted
for
him
twice
but
then
pleaded
with
the
mayor
not
to
sign
the
legislation
please
dont
make
me
and
countless
other
parents
explain
to
our
children
that
good
men
craving
power
pushed
aside
the
peoples
voice
he
said
those
seeking
to
derail
the
legislation
which
the
city
council
approved
on
oct
23
appealed
to
the
mayors
sense
of
pride
arguing
that
his
legacy
would
be
tarnished
by
a
push
to
ease
term
limits
without
returning
to
the
voters
who
created
them
just
ask
yourself
how
would
you
like
to
be
remembered
in
the
history
books
said
andre
calvert
23
from
brooklyn
do
you
really
want
to
be
remembered
as
a
mayor
who
along
with
29
city
council
members
overturned
the
will
of
the
people
when
it
was
their
turn
however
many
who
favored
the
legislation
said
that
voters
would
have
a
chance
to
speak
out
on
term
limits
at
the
polls
next
year
when
bloomberg
seeks
reelection
most
of
them
cited
the
fragile
economy
as
a
reason
for
letting
bloomberg
a
former
wall
street
executive
remain
in
office
the
crowd
at
the
bill
signing
dwarfed
any
in
modern
memory
with
the
line
of
those
signed
up
to
testify
zigzagging
across
the
marble
rotunda
at
city
hall
by
9
am
george
arzt
a
veteran
political
consultant
who
has
attended
dozens
of
city
hall
bill
signings
over
the
last
40
years
said
that
there
have
been
controversial
items
that
come
up
but
nothing
in
this
realm

not
even
close
there
were
lighter
moments
as
when
jimmy
mcmillan
representing
a
political
group
called
the
rent
is
too
damn
high
party
turned
his
back
to
bloomberg
as
he
addressed
the
mayor
saying
the
mayor
had
turned
his
back
on
the
people
i
have
no
desire
to
look
at
you
mcmillan
said
when
mcmillan
called
bloomberg
a
nice
guy
a
rich
guy
a
goodlooking
man
the
mayor
suppressed
a
smile
but
mostly
as
the
parade
of
speakers
stretched
into
its
third
hour
bloomberg
sat
stonefaced
behind
a
thick
wooden
table
even
those
who
angrily
opposed
the
legislation
commended
his
endurance
thanks
for
sitting
here
said
john
jiler
a
62yearold
writer
from
lower
manhattan
this
must
not
be
easy
to
you
but
in
the
next
breath
jiler
tore
into
the
mayor
with
the
presidential
election
nearing
he
said
his
two
children
ages
9
and
11
were
so
enthralled
with
the
idea
that
one
person
can
make
their
voice
heard
throughout
the
whole
planet
but
unfortunately
now
he
said
i
have
to
give
them
lesson
no
2
which
is
that
every
so
often
a
caesar
comes
along
and
tries
to
muffle
that
voice
the
tradition
of
allowing
the
public
to
speak
before
a
bill
is
signed
dates
back
at
least
as
far
as
the
19th
century
and
occasionally
has
been
known
to
sway
a
mayor
once
after
hearing
hours
of
fiery
testimony
in
1897
mayor
william
l
strong
vetoed
a
bill
regulating
sidewalk
street
vendors
about
a
halfdozen
members
of
the
new
york
city
council
sat
next
to
the
mayor
during
the
ceremony
but
as
the
testimony
dragged
on
several
struggled
to
pay
attention
with
one
tapping
away
on
his
blackberry
and
another
appearing
to
listen
to
messages
on
his
cell
phone
when
the
testimony
was
over
around
2
pm
it
was
bloombergs
turn
to
speak
still
sitting
behind
the
table
with
the
room
half
empty
he
said
that
i
thought
long
and
hard
about
the
issue
after
long
opposing
any
attempt
to
tweak
term
limits

he
once
called
the
idea
disgraceful

the
mayor
said
he
had
decided
to
reverse
himself
you
know
that
i
have
over
a
period
of
time
fundamentally
changed
my
opinion
in
terms
of
how
long
somebody
could
be
in
office
bloomberg
said
nobody
is
irreplaceable
he
said
but
i
do
think
that
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
real
world
at
how
long
it
takes
to
do
things
he
added
and
finished
the
thought
i
do
think
that
three
terms
makes
more
sense
than
two
with
that
the
lefthanded
bloomberg
picked
up
a
black
and
gold
pen
and
with
a
flick
of
his
wrist
rewrote
new
york

said

its

to
remember
how

they
vote
on

a

today
some

crowded

not
just
with

and
to

the

pace
secretary
of

kurt
browning
said
voter
turnout
could
meet
or
exceed
the
current
florida
record
of
83
percent
set
in
1992
be
patient
and
be
prepared
browning
advised
lines
are
not
necessarily
a
sign
of
something
bad
or
something
gone
wrong
lines
are
a
sign
of
a
healthy
democracy
browning
said
he
had
spoken
with
gov
charlie
crists
staff
and
urged
that
if
there
is
any
whimper
of
talk
about
extending
polling
hours
that
we
really
need
to
make
sure
its
the
right
thing
to
do
for
the
first
time
the
state
wont
release
any
election
results
until
8
pm
that
is
being
done
to
accommodate
voters
in
much
of
the
panhandle
which
is
on
central
time
meaning
the
polls
close
an
hour
later
than
the
florida
peninsula
my
job
as
the
secretary
browning
said
is
to
ensure
a
fair
honest
accurate
election
and
thats
what
were
going
to
deliver
for
florida
although
rain
is
expected
this
morning
in
los
angeles
election
officials
anticipate
a
record
turnout
in
this
historic
election
and
have
deployed
extra
poll
workers
and
printed
additional
ballots
to
handle
the
crush
of
voters
i
think
the
motivation
and
interest
in
this
election
is
at
an
alltime
high
and
i
think
people
will
find
their
way
to
the
polls
to
vote
registrarrecorder
dean
logan
said
hopefully
the
rain
will
hold
off
and
we
wont
have
people
out
in
the
elements
waiting
to
vote
the
national
weather
service
is
predicting
a
60
percent
chance
of
rain
in
parts
of
los
angeles
county
this
morning
clearing
by
the
afternoon
an
election
watchdog
group
is
concerned
there
wont
be
enough
ballots
for
all
the
voters
and
a
looming
crisis
is
brewing
but
logan
said
his
office
will
deliver
extra
ballots
to
75
to
100
precincts
and
has
made
contingency
plans
in
case
ballots
do
run
out
we
believe
there
will
be
sufficient
quantifies
of
ballots
in
those
precincts
where
voter
registration
totals
have
gone
up
significantly
logan
said
over
the
weekend
election
protection
advocates
sent
a
letter
to
logan
asking
him
to
print
enough
precinctmarked
ballots
to
guarantee
a
ballot
for
every
one
of
the
countys
record
43
million
registered
voters
the
advocates
made
the
request
after
learning
that
some
precinct
inspectors
only
received
800
ballots
in
precincts
with
rosters
of
1500
voters
a
result
of
logan
reportedly
only
ordering
enough
ballots
for
80
percent
of
the
registered
voter
pool
with
the
inactive
voters
purged
from
the
pool
according
to
work
the
vote
los
angeles
in
the
event
of
a
ballot
shortage
the
county
has
contingency
plans
to
deliver
extra
ballots
to
the
polls
and
use
emergency
ballots
when
the
supply
of
regular
ballots
runs
out
poll
workers
can
use
the
yellow
emergency
ballots
which
are
transcribed
onto

sheri
myers
of
work
the

we
may
be
looking
at
races
and
propositions
that
are
held
up
for
days
because
so
many
emergency
ballots
are
used
in
the
county
myers
said
the
advocates
are
especially
concerned
about
the
potential
impact
of
the
purported
ballot
shortage
on
the
race
between
los

the
wait
for
a
publicly
traded
kohlberg
kravis
roberts
just
grew
a
little
longer
the
company
a
private
equity
firm
said
on
monday
that
it
was
delaying
the
purchase
of
a
publicly
listed
affiliate
until
next
year
amid
the
turmoil
troubling
the
markets
kohlberg
executives
said
the
rescheduling
was
a
result
of
complications
arising
from
the
merger
which
would
combine
the
firm
with
the
affiliate
kkr
private
equity
investors
which
is
traded
on
the
euronext
exchange
in
amsterdam
netherlands
the
investment
thesis
for
the
transaction
is
solid
george
r
roberts
a
founder
of
kohlberg
said
on
a
call
with
analysts
on
monday
we
remain
committed
to
completing
the
transaction
the
news
was
the
latest
bump
in
kohlbergs
quest
to
start
trading
in
the
public
markets
a
process
started
at
the
height
of
the
private
equity
boom
in
july
2007
first
the
firm
sought
an
initial
offering
following
in
the
footsteps
of
fortress
investment
group
and
the
blackstone
group
with
the
credit
squeeze
though
kohlberg
and
its
peers
have
suffered
as
they
have
been
cut
off
from
dealmaking
the
source
of
their
previously
lavish
profits
last
july
kohlberg
said
it
would
go
public
by
acquiring
the
88
percent
of
kkr
private
equity
investors
that
it
did
not
already
own
and
by
relisting
21
percent
of
the
combined
companys
shares
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
unlike
in
the
blackstone
or
fortress
offerings
none
of
kohlbergs
top
executives
will
cash
out
through
the
deal
the
affiliates
earnings
shed
some
light
on
how
kohlbergs
companies
are
performing
an
unusual
amount
of
disclosure
for
buyout
firms
which
are
often
secretive
the
fund
which
invests
in
kohlbergs
private
equity
funds
as
well
as
several
companies
owned
by
the
buyout
firm
said
its
assets
value
fell
153
percent
to
387
billion
in
the
third
quarter
the
total
return
for
private
equity
investors
for
the
year
through
sept
30
was
negative
226
percent
slightly
worse
than
the
standard
ampamp
poors
500stock
index
or
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
have
performed
over
the
same
period
while
private
equity
investors
said
the
value
of
some
investments
like
its
stake
in
the
hospital
operator
hca
owned
by
kohlberg
rose
most
of
its
other
holdings
declined
its
investment
in
bonds
of
sun
microsystems
for
example
fell
about
11
percent
from
the
second
quarter
to
511
million
other
stakes
mostly
in
european
companies
declined
in
part
because
of
fluctuations
in
foreign
exchange
rates
after
nearly
two
years
of
rollercoaster
campaigning
a
billion
dollars
in
campaign
spending
and
the
most
diverse
slate
of
major
candidates
ever
this
historic
presidential
election
comes
to
a
close
today
polls
open
in
florida
at
7
am
and
close
at
7
pm
given
the
importance
of
floridas
27
electoral
votes
sens
john
mccain
and
barack
obama
both
hit
the
state
monday
for
one
last
pitch
we
will
win
florida
and
we
will
win
this
race
there
is
one
day
left
until
we
take
america
in
a
new
direction
my
friends
we
need
your
help
and
we
will
win
mccain
told
nearly
1200
supporters
outside
raymond
james
stadium
in
tampa
on
monday
morning
the
pundits
may
not
know
it
and
the
democrats
may
not
know
it
but
the
mac
is
back
were
going
to
win
this
election
obama
drew
more
than
7000
to
a
rally
in
jacksonville
a
republican
stronghold
that
also
holds
searing
symbolism
for
democrats
who
remember
tens
of
thousands
of
africanamerican
votes
invalidated
in
the
2000
election
dont
believe
for
a
second
this
election
is
over
the
illinois
senator
said
dont
think
for
a
minute
that
power
will
concede
anything
for
a
minute
without
a
fight
this
is
going
to
be
close
here
in
florida
we
have
to
work
like
our
future
depends
on
it
in
the
next
24
hours
because
it
does
this
is
about
who
wants
it
more
the
candidates
their
spouses
and
their
running
mates
roared
through
more
than
a
dozen
battleground
states
their
paths
underscoring
the
challenge
facing
mccain
of
the
seven
states
where
he
campaigned
only
pennsylvania
went
democratic
four
years
ago
obama
campaigned
in
florida
north
carolina
and
virginia
each
of
which
bush
won
in
2004
until
this
year
north
carolina
and
virginia
had
been
safe
republican
states
in
tampa
mccain
was
joined
on
stage
by
gov
charlie
crist
and
sens
mel
martinez
and
joe
lieberman
and
was
introduced
by
former
tampa
bay
buccaneers
fullback
mike
alstott
we
can
trust
john
mccain
to
put
his
country
first
because
thats
what
hes
always
done
said
alstott
a
registered
republican
the
arizona
senator
hammered
obama
as
unready
and
sure
to
raise
taxes
sen
obama
is
running
to
be
redistributionist
in
chief
i
am
running
to
be
commander
in
chief
said
mccain
periodically
interrupted
by
chants
of
nobama
and
usa
the
crowd
size
was
not
a
great
sign
for
mccain
however
on
the
sunday
before
the
2004
election
president
bush
drew
nearly
15000
to
a
rally
across
the
street
on
monday
night
at
a
rally
for
obama
comedian
george
lopez
joked
to
a
crowd
of
about
300
at
the
cuban
club
in
ybor
city
that
he
had
thought
obama
was
going
to
pick
him
as
a
running
mate
while
poking
fun
at
mccain
running
mate
sarah
palin
im
well
qualified
i
told
obama
i
can
see
mexico
from
my
front
porch
lopez
joked
the
crowd
cheered
loudly
and
waved
signs
saying
hispanics
for
obama
turn
florida
blue
through
sunday
358000
more
democrats
than
republicans
had
cast
ballots
in
florida
but
buzz
jacobs
mccains
florida
campaign
manager
said
he
is
confident
the
early
vote
results
are
stronger
for
mccain
than
many
people
assume
i
expect
it
to
be
a
very
long
night
tuesday
i
think
its
going
to
be
a
razorthin
victory
for
us
jacobs
said
obama
appeared
at
the
jacksonville
veterans
memorial
arena
the
same
site
where
mccain
in
september
declared
the
fundamentals
of
our
economy
are
strong
on
monday
obama
focused
on
the
economy
and
his
promise
that
no
one
earning
less
than
250000
a
year
will
see
their
taxes
rise
that
includes
98
percent
of
small
businesses
and
999
percent
of
plumbers
obama
said
to
laughter
the
grueling
schedule
is
apparently
taking
a
toll
with
obama
at
one
point
referring
to
being
in
ohio
rather
than
florida
steve
schale
obamas
florida
campaign
manager
said
he
feels
confident
were
where
we
want
to
be
in
terms
of
turning
out
voters
and
talking
to
undecideds
schale
said
the
hardest
thing
right
now
is
this
next
36hour
period
weve
put
our
game
in
place
but
now
its
up
to
voters

a

indiana
mccain
is
scarcely
ahead
in
a
state
that
has
a
perfect
gop

record
since

obama
made
inroads
as
a

son

a

would
be

ohio
along

its
one
of
three
traditional

states
polls
show
obama
leading
but

is
running
hard
and

is
not
quite

predisposed
to

as

florida
most

polls
close

but
the

are
an
hour
later
its
quite
simple
the
electoral
math
doesnt
work
for
mccain
without
having
florida
in
his
column
if
obama
manages
to
hold
on
to
his
lead
in
the
polls
which
has
been
slipping
and
captures
the
state
mccain
would
have
to
score
an
unlikely
set
of
upsets
to
recover
pennsylvania
this
rich
prize
has
tilted
toward
democrats
in
recent
elections
and
favors
obama
strongly
in
the
polls
mccain
has
not
given
up
though
and
an
upset
win
here
could
signal
that
mccain
is
drawing
bluecollar
voters
who
are
important
in
other
key
states
like
missouri
missouri
mccain
is
leading
slightly
in

swing
state

winner

has
been

both
times
a
wealthy
venezuelan
businessman
was
found
guilty
in
federal
court
in
miami
on
monday
of
acting
as
an
illegal
foreign
agent
sent
to
the
united
states
to
cover
up
his
governments
role
in
a
political
scandal
involving
a
cashstuffed
suitcase
smuggled
into
argentina
during
the
eightweek
trial
prosecutors
argued
that
key
biscayne
resident
franklin
duran
41
was
working
for
venezuelas
intelligence
service
when
he
sought
to
cover
up
the
secret
donation
of
oil
money
from
the
venezuelan
government
of
hugo
chavez
to
the
campaign
of
argentinas
president
cristina
fernandez
the
us
government
was
initially
accused
of
politicizing
the
case
in
an
effort
to
embarrass
chavez
a
vocal
leftist
critic
of
the
bush
administration
opponents
of
chavez
say
the
case
provides
valuable
insight
into
his
governments
illegal
use
of
income
from
the
countrys
stateowned
oil
company
petroleos
de
venezuela
or
pdvsa
to
help
political
allies
the
charges
relate
to
an
incident
in
august
2007
when
durans
friend
and
business
partner
guido
antonini
46
also
of
key
biscayne
was
stopped
by
a
customs
agent
in
argentina
after
arriving
on
a
private
jet
chartered
by
pdvsa
he
was
briefly
detained
after
almost
800000
in
cash
was
found
in
his
luggage
duran
and
four
other
defendants
were
later
accused
of
arranging
a
series
of
meetings
in
the
miami
area
to
get
antonini
to
lie
about
the
origin
of
the
cash
unbeknownst
to
the
defendants
antonini
wore
an
fbi
recording
device
at
meetings
venezuelan
and
argentina
officials
have
angrily
denied
the
money
was
a
political
contribution
though
they
have
failed
to
explain
why
the
cash
was
on
the
plane
while
the
trial
did
not
provide
proof
that
the
money
was
intended
for
argentinas
president
prosecutors
put
on
a
strong
case
linking
duran
to
several
top
chavez
officials
prosecutors
were
aided
by
three
of
the
defendants
who
pleaded
guilty
and
testified
against
duran
one
of
them
durans
business
partner
carlos
kauffmann
told
jurors
that
the
venezuelan
intelligence
service
sought
their
help
to
silence
antonini
in
return
for
government
favors
kauffmann
admitted
that
he
and
duran
had
over
the
years
made
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
on
public
contracts
after
paying
kickbacks
to
government
officials
there
is
no
mystery
as
to
what
happened
in
this
case
assistant
us
attorney
john
shipley
said
in
his
closing
arguments
duran
came
here
on
a
mission
a
mission
to
hide
the
source
of
the
money
he
said
duran
attorney
ed
shohat
argued
in
court
that
duran
was
simply
trying
to
help
his
friend
while
protecting
his
own
legitimate
oil
business
he
denounced
the
case
as
a
political
circus
and
vowed
to
appeal
the
verdict
duran
faces
a
maximum
of
15
years
in
prison
at
his
sentencing
jan
12
it
is
probably
not
a
great
idea
for
a
hotel
to
alienate
a
business
traveler
like
richard
glassman
not
when
times
are
good
and
especially
not
now
when
the
hotel
business
is
hurting
but
a
hilton
hotel
in
washington
dc
did
just
that
recently
and
then
the
problem
was
compounded

according
to
both
glassman
and
hilton

when
someone
at
the
companys
loyalty
program
hilton
hhonors
dropped
the
ball
glassman
a
partner
in
a
prominent
memphis
law
firm
was
a
frequent
hilton
customer
until
late
september
when
his
scheduled
twonight
stay
at
the
hilton
washington
hotel
went
astray
after
he
tried
to
change
his
arrival
date
to
sept
27
from
sept
26
glassman
said
he
was
prompted
to
email
me
after
reading
a
column
i
wrote
a
few
weeks
ago
about
being
hit
with
a
41429
penalty
when
i
called
to
cancel
a
twonight
stay
at
the
st
regis
a
starwood
hotel
in
aspen
colo
according
to
glassmans
account
which
hilton
did
not
dispute
a
hotel
clerk
told
him
he
could
not
check
in
on
sept
27
because
a
large
group
was
checking
in
that
day
there
wont
be
anyone
on
the
desk
to
accommodate
you
he
says
he
was
told
i
said
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
this
youre
saying
that
no
matter
what
time
i
get
there
even
if
i
get
there
at
10
pm
you
have
the
room
but
you
wont
have
any
desk
people
available
to
check
me
in
correct
the
clerk
said
glassman
decided
the
clerk
was
joking
i
know
a
couple
of
guys
in
hilton
corporate
so
i
said
to
her
wait
they
put
an
asterisk
next
to
my
name
in
the
computer
and
told
you
to
do
this
right
he
recalled
excuse
me
the
woman
replied
getting
the
old
offensive
bureaucratic
excuse
me
a
reply
to
which
there
is
no
known
rejoinder
glassman
instead
called
hilton
hhonors
but
he
got
nowhere
they
advised
me
that
they
had
no
control
over
specific
properties
he
said
what
glassman
did
next
was
cancel
all
of
his
existing
hilton
reservations

and
those
of
his
21member
law
firm
as
well
and
then
he
emailed
me
at
hiltons
headquarters
in
beverly
hills
calif
adam
burke
a
senior
vice
president
who
manages
hilton
hhonors
worldwide
had
an
immediate
reaction
when
he
heard
all
of
this
a
few
days
ago
gaskets
were
blown
burke
said
using
the
passive
voice
but
making
it
clear
that
he
was
the
one
who
blew
a
gasket
just
what
a
worldwide
hotel
loyalty
program
needs

an
unhappy
loyal
guest
who
stays
frequently
at
luxury
brands
my
short
answer
burke
told
me
is
that
i
am
concerned
obviously
i
would
like
to
make
sure
we
get
customer
service
right
100
percent
of
the
time
it
seems
like
we
could
have
handled
this
better
burke
said
that
he
regarded
the
matter
as
a
training
opportunity
for
those
down
the
chain
of
command
who
had
mishandled
glassmans
reservation
and
their
supervisors
by
the
way
i
belong
to
hilton
hhonors
among
other
hotel
loyalty
programs
and
so
does
my
wife
who
also
travels
on
business
were
both
happy
customers
but
it
takes
only
one
big
foulup
to
change
that
all
right
two
in
the
glassman
case
with
hotel
profits
under
siege
this
is
not
the
time
to
be
making
your
most
loyal
customers
unhappy
glassman
says
for
example
that
he
travels
about
once
a
week
on
business
its
never
more
important
to
get
it
right
than
in
a
down
cycle
burke
said
every
time
weve
seen
that
cycle
in
the
last
20
years
the
hhonors
members
were
our
core
market
that
sustained
the
business
glassman
is
a
tough
customer
who
values
loyalty
but
thinks
it
works
both
ways
he
and
his
wife
recently
canceled
reservations
to
stay
at
hilton
hotels
on
a
trip
to
syracuse
he
says
he
isnt
looking
for
amelioration
from
hilton
a
hilton
hhonors
representative
called
him
on
monday
to
apologize
and
assure
him
the
problem
would
be
addressed
he
said
he
wasnt
moved
they
said
they
will
miss
me
a
report
released
on
monday
by
a
state
board
found
that
gov
sarah
palin
did
not
apply
improper
pressure
to
try
to
dismiss
a
state
trooper
who
was
her
former
brotherinlaw
and
did
not
violate
state
ethics
laws
in
the
firing
of
her
public
safety
commissioner
the
report
by
the
alaska
personnel
board
contradicts
the
conclusions
last
month
of
a
separate
inquiry
into
the
matter
overseen
by
a
bipartisan
legislative
panel
the
earlier
inquiry
found
that
palin
had
breached
a
state
ethics
act
by
pressing
to
have
the
trooper
mike
wooten
fired
the
panel
said
however
that
the
governor
was
within
her
rights
to
fire
the
public
safety
commissioner
walt
monegan
the
personnel
boards
report
based
on
an
investigation
led
by
an
independent
counsel
timothy
j
petumenos
concluded
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
prove
palin
or
any
state
employee
had
acted
improperly
in
monegans
dismissal
the
report
said
the
legislative
inquiry
had
based
its
conclusions
on
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
state
ethics
laws
and
on
insufficient
evidence
the
lawmakers
who
ordered
the
first
inquiry
stood
by
their
report
on
monday
in
a
statement
about
the
new
report
palins
lawyer
thomas
v
van
flein
said
the
governor
is
grateful
that
this
investigation
has
provided
a
fair
and
impartial
review
of
this
matter
and
upholds
the
governors
ability
to
take
measures
when
necessary
to
ensure
that
alaskans
have
the
best
possible
team
working
to
serve
them
monegan
has
said
he
believes
he
was
fired
because
he
would
not
bend
to
pressure
from
palin
her
husband
todd
and
her
subordinates
to
fire
wooten
who
had
been
through
a
bitter
divorce
with
the
governors
sister
he
said
that
he
had
received
many
complaints
about
wooten
from
the
palins
and
several
members
of
the
administration
and
that
he
felt
they
wanted
him
to
dismiss
wooten
who
is
still
on
the
force
petumenos
said
the
governor
and
other
state
employees
had
testified
firmly
that
several
conversations
monegan
described
had
not
happened
no
witnesses
confirmed
monegans
account
of
the
discussions
he
said
they
didnt
happen
at
all
petumenos
said
unless
someone
can
be
proved
to
abuse
their
power
petumenos
added
it
seems
to
me
they
havent
done
it
monegan
said
monday
in
an
interview
the
conversations
absolutely
did
take
place
ive
been
a
police
officer
for
some
35
years
arent
i
supposed
to
tell
the
truth
and
in
this
case
i
did
under
oath
to
both
investigators
its
not
only
me
monegan
said
there
were
senior
members
of
the
department
of
public
safety
who
got
the
calls
felt
the
pressure
and
knew
exactly
what
was
going
on
i
will
always
feel
that
there
were
conversations
and
emails
that
were
intended
to
inappropriately
use
an
official
government
position
to
settle
a
family
matter
he
added
obviously
im
disappointed
with
the
outcome
and
the
contradictory
nature
of
this
investigation
compared
to
the
first
one
the
governor
of
alaska
appoints
the
members
of
the
alaska
personnel
board
though
all
three
of
the
boards
current
members
were
appointed
by
palins
predecessor
palin
reappointed
one
member
to
a
new
term
said
a
spokesman
for
the
governor
bill
mcallister
this
is
obviously
the
correct
outcome
mcallister
said
we
knew
all
along
that
governor
palin
did
not
abuse
her
power
john
cyr
the
executive
director
of
the
alaska
public
safety
employees
association
said
it
was
not
surprising
that
a
board
appointed
by
the
governors
office
would
reach
the
conclusion
we
all
knew
that
the
governors
office
was
putting
pressure
on
the
department
of
public
safety
to
take
action
against
michael
wooten
cyr
said
in
late
july
several
weeks
after
monegan
was
fired
the
states
bipartisan
legislative
council
ordered
an
inquiry
into
his
dismissal
the
controversy
undercut
palins
image
as
a
reformer
but
it
did
not
become
prominent
nationally
until
late
august
when
she
was
chosen
as
the
running
mate
for
sen
john
mccain
the
republican
presidential
nominee
palin
had
said
earlier
in
the
summer
that
she
would
cooperate
with
the
legislative
inquiry
but
after
she
was
nominated
she
refused
to
testify
the
mccainpalin
campaign
said
the
inquiry
had
become
politically
driven
and
sent
lawyers
and
staff
to
alaska
to
help
with
the
governors
legal
strategy
and
to
hold
palin
truth
squad
news
conferences
almost
daily
in
september
palin
took
the
unusual
step
of
filing
an
ethics
complaint
against
herself
to
the
personnel
board
which
she
said
was
the
proper
forum
for
dealing
with
the
matter
the
boards
report
said
it
was
based
on
substantially
more
evidence
than
the
legislative
inquiry
including
a
threehour
deposition
from
palin
petumenos
said
the
legislative
inquiry
had
determined
that
palin
violated
the
scope
of
state
ethics
laws
by
inaction
because
she
supposedly
did
not
stop
her
staff
and
husband
from
pressuring
monegan
but
petumenos
said
the
legislative
inquiry
had
not
met
requirements
for
finding
a
violation
because
it
did
not
cite
violations
under
specific
sections
of
the
ethics
code
in
the
legislative
report
the
investigator
stephen
e
branchflower
a
former
prosecutor
in
anchorage
said
that
palin
had
herself
applied
pressure
to
get
wooten
dismissed
and
also
let
her
husband
and
subordinates
press
for
his
firing
the
report
concluded
that
she
violated
the
alaska
executive
branch
ethics
act
state
sen
kim
elton
a
democrat
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
legislative
council
said
of
the
personnel
boards
findings
im
surprised
i
think
the
ethics
act
is
very
clear
and
that
mr
branchflower
strung
together
a
series
of
events
that
made
it
clear
there
was
not
only
smoke
but
fire
the
drug
enforcement
administration
has
paid
more
than
33
million
to
four
confidential
informants
in
an
investigation
that
led
to
the
arrest
of
a
man
prosecutors
called
an
international
arms
dealer
according
to
court
documents
the
man
monzer
alkassar
and
a
codefendant
luis
felipe
moreno
godoy
are
scheduled
to
go
on
trial
this
week
in

district
court
in

they
are
charged
in
a
conspiracy
to
sell
weapons
to

who
wanted
to
kill
americans
there
opening
statements
are
scheduled
wednesday
a
third
defendant
tareq
mousa
alghazi
was
also
to
stand
trial
but
he
had
a
heart
attack
and
required
emergency
surgery
said
his
lawyer
marc
a
agnifilo
the
judge
jed
s
rakoff
ordered
his
case
to
be
separated
and
said
he
would
be
tried
later
the
three
men
have
been
charged
with
conspiring
to
support
terrorism
and
to
kill
americans
they
have
pleaded
not
guilty
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
government
to
pay
informants
for
their
services
and
expenses
defense
lawyers
typically
seek
to
use
such
information
to
attack
the
credibility
of
an
informant
who
testifies
as
a
government
witness
arguing
that
with
a
financial
incentive
to
help
build
a
case
the
informant
cannot
be
trusted
prosecutors
on
the
other
hand
may
point
out
that
such
payments
are
necessary
because
informants
work
at
great
risk
and
can
incur
unusual
travel
and
living
expenses
while
participating
in
an
undercover
operation
there
is
little
question
though
that
such
payments
add
to
the
intrigue
of
such
cases
in
the
kassar
investigation
the
government
used
informants
to
help
conduct
a
sting
operation
that
began
a
few
years
ago
with
informants
posing
as
players
in
a
deal
to
sell
weapons
to
the
revolutionary
armed
forces
of
colombia
or
farc
the
four
informants
received
payments
of
1457
million
955000
775000
and
174000
according
to
a
defense
lawyers
statement
in
court
based
on
information
supplied
by
the
government
it
was
not
clear
how
many
years
the
payments
covered
but
they
appeared
to
date
back
long
before
the
beginning
of
the
kassar
case
prosecutors
said
for
example
that
one
informant
received
payments
over
an
approximately
20year
tenure
as
a
confidential
source
times
business
columnist
it
was
only
a
few
years

happy

day
you
are
happy
arent

this
is
the
beginning
of
the
rest
of
the
year
after
today
we
can
move
on
to
more
important
things
such
as
the
bowl
championship
series
and
planning
for
thanksgiving
the
term
election
day
of
course
is
getting
to
be
a
little
outdated
given
that
almost
four
in
10
floridians
already
have
voted
if
this
trend
keeps
up
we
might
want
to
rename
it
as
countthevote
day
that
assumes
of
course
that
the
vote
actually
gets
counted
today
there
is
no
reason
it
shouldnt
not
by
now
not
in
florida
anybody
who
messes
up
an
election
in
florida
ought
to
be
kicked
out
of
the
state
if
there
has
to
be
a
screwup
let
it
be
somewhere
else
let
some
other
states
ballots
go
missing
its
machines
cough
up
negative
numbers
its
computers
declare
a

for
grover
cleveland
let
the
assembled
media
of
the
world
descend
upon
albuquerque
or
des
moines
but
preferably
let
it
happen
nowhere
at
all
were
due
for
a
nice
clean
undisputed
election
please
here
in
florida
theres
still
a
certain
amount
of
drama
over
whether
john
mccain
will
take
the
state
against
barack
obama
but
mercifully
we
will
not
decide
the
presidential
race
by
ourselves
no
matter
who
wins
we
are
blessed
otherwise
with
a
lack
of
statewide
races
no
governor
no
us
senator
no
members
of
the
cabinet
all
we
have
statewide
are
a
few
amendments
to
the
constitution
and
some
routine
renewals
for
supreme
court
justices
none
has
ever
been
kicked
out
and
there
is
no
reason
for
it
to
happen
this
year
either
of
the
amendments
only
one
amendment
2
on
banning
samesex
marriage
has
gotten
much
attention
it
seems
close
to
reaching
the
60
percent
needed
to
pass
it
wouldnt
be
stunning
to
see
some
or
even
all
of
the
other
amendments
fall
short
of
60
percent
which
shows
the
importance
of
that
higher
standard
the
idea
of
requiring
60
percent
was
to
make
it
harder
for
floridians
to
amend
their
constitution
willynilly
and
it
seems
to
be
working
even
if
the
rule
was
itself
passed
in
2006
by
fewer
than
60
percent
of
the
voters
besides
the
presidential
race
the
big
national
story
is
how
many
seats
the
democrats
pick
up
in
congress
but
here
in
florida
there
is
no
corresponding
drama
concerning
our
state
legislature
that
body
is
safely
in
the
hands
of
republicans
and
even
if
there
is
an
upset
here
or
there
the
overall
control
is
extremely
unlikely
to
change
as
far
as
drama
then
we
are
left
to
look
for
individual
local
upsets
and
this
year
is
a
little
unpredictable
given
the
national
obama
tide
again
it
wouldnt
be
shocking
to
see
a
stray
legislator
county
commissioner
school
board
incumbent
or
elections
supervisor
booted
you
might
think
this
is
a
crazy
statement
but
it
seems
that
on
the
local
level
this
years
election
has
been
less
negative
overall
heck
i
havent
heard
a
single
candidate
accused
of
supporting
child
molesters
like
we
had
around
here
last
time
id
like
to
think
that
with
early
voting
which
lessens
the
impact
of
lastminute
attacks
the
rise
of
factchecking
and
a
general
wising
up
of
voters
at
least
some
of
them
that
stupid
mudslinging
has
lost
some
of
its
punch
id
like
to
think
that
in
any
case

to
clear

of

kits
in

lapd
officials
said
monday
that
they
have
begun
prioritizing
the
kits
to
catch
rapists
who
havent
been
identified
and
might
still
be
on
the
loose
the
department
hopes
to
have
the
cases
categorized
for
analysis
within
the
next
two
months
deputy
chief
charlie
beck
told
the
city
councils
public
safety
committee
we
have
a
number
of
cases
sitting
there
where
the
rapist
has
been
identified
but
for
some
reason
is
not
being
prosecuted
beck
said
it
could
be
a
case
where
officials
say
there
is
a
problem
with
consent
by
the
victim
or
other
factors
that
make
it
a
weak
case
or
it
could
be
the
person
was
prosecuted
and
the
dna
was
never
processed
beck
said
there
is
no
way
to
determine
how
many
of
the
backlogged
cases
fall
into
that
category
last
week
the
council
approved
nearly
1
million
to
hire
16
criminalist
scientists
and
contract
with
private
firms
after
a
critical
audit
from
controller
laura
chick
about
the
backlog
and
the
threat
it
means
to
victims
beck
who
heads
the
detective
division
and
has
been
given
authority
over
the
lab
has
created
a
task
force
to
look
at
the
backlog
as
well
as
problems
within
the
division
in
how
it
handles
other
material
including
fingerprints
it
is
not
a
simple
case
of
just
looking
at
the
evidence
and
making
a
decision
beck
said
what
we
have
to
do
is
first
determine
if
there
is
enough
dna
to
process
and
that
in
itself
could
take
several
days
to
determine
beck
said
he
also
is
working
with
the
private
contractors
to
determine
how
much
he
will
be
able
to
use
them
our
goal
after
all
this
is

he

that
when
the

sends
out
the
dna
kits
it
will
be
worth
it
each

costs
about
1000
to
process
if
we
have
dna
we
do
want
to
process
the

even
if
there
was

we
have
the

councilman
jack
weiss
who
chairs
the
public

committee
agreed
noting
that
rape
is
a
crime
where
there
are
repeat
offenders
who
often
commit
other
crimes
the
police
department
on
monday
reassigned
to
desk
duty
four
officers
who
are
under
scrutiny
over
charges
by
a
man
who
said
he
was
sodomized
with
a
piece
of
police
equipment
during
a
scuffle
in
a
brooklyn
subway
station
a
police
spokesman
said
the
decision
to
place
the
officers
on
modified
assignment
requires
them
to
surrender
their
guns
and
shields
and
suggests
a
change
in
the
position
of
the
department
which
had
insisted
that
it
saw
no
evidence
of
misconduct
by
the
officers
officers
are
often
modified
in
anticipation
of
possible
disciplinary
action
the
reported
assault
is
said
to
have
occurred
oct
15
and
a
review
of
the
encounter
by
the
departments
internal
affairs
bureau
over
the
following
week
failed
to
find
wrongdoing
by
the
officers
who
are
from
the
71st
precinct
but
the
investigation
has
continued
under
the
auspices
of
the
brooklyn
district
attorney
and
new
evidence
and
witnesses

including
a
fifth
officer
assigned
to
the
transit
police

have
emerged
the
outlines
of
the
transit
officers
account
of
what
took
place
in
the
encounter
was
relayed
last
week
to
investigators
and
his
lawyer
paul
p
martin
met
with
prosecutors
on
monday
martin
said
the
police
and
prosecutors
have
not
released
much
information
about
their
continuing
investigation
they
did
search
a
locker
in
the
71st
precinct
station
house
on
monday
one
official
said
but
the
results
of
the
search
were
unclear
one
law
enforcement
official
who
did
not
want
to
be
identified
because
he
was
not
authorized
to
discuss
the
investigation
said
the
action
against
the
four
officers

alex
cruz
noel
jugraj
richard
kern
and
andrew
morales

stemmed
from
information
from
the
transit
officer
who
was
present
during
the
alleged
assault
but
who
according
to
his
lawyer
is
being
treated
as
a
witness
rather
than
as
a
target
of
the
investigation
no
action
has
been
taken
against
that
officer
who
has
not
been
identified
stuart
london
the
lawyer
for
cruz
declined
comment
the
lawyers
for
the
three
other
officers
did
not
return
telephone
messages
on
monday
afternoon
a
police
spokesman
declined
comment
citing
a
grand
jury
investigation
by
the
brooklyn
district
attorney
charles
j
hynes
later
in
the
evening
the
spokesman
paul
j
browne
confirmed
that
the
action
had
been
taken
against
the
officers
in
the
encounter
being
investigated
the
officers
chased
a
24yearold
man
they
said
they
believed
was
smoking
marijuana
into
the
prospect
park
subway
station
lawyers
for
the
man
michael
mineo
a
24yearold
body
piercer
at
a
tattoo
parlor
said
that
the
officers
tackled
mineo
and
that
three
held
him
down
while
a
fourth
sodomized
him
with
a
piece
of
equipment
no
drugs
were
found
and
the
police
let
him
go
with
a
disorderly
conduct
summons
mineo
ended
up
in
a
hospital
with
injuries
including
a
tear
to
his
rectum
that
one
law
enforcement
official
said
was
both
external
and
internal
the
police
initially
cast
doubt
on
mineos
account
saying
in
a
statement
that
the
assertion
that
he
was
sodomized
is
not
supported
by
independent
civilian
witnesses
on
the
scene
more
recently
though
the
police
commissioner
raymond
w
kelly
has
said
he
welcomed
the
grand
jury
investigation
by
hynes
in
placing
the
officers
on
modified
duty
the
department
would
not
necessarily
be
suggesting
that
it
accepted
mineos
account
of
brutality
but
the
change
would
suggest
that
the
department
now
suspects
some
level
of
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
officers
either
in
connection
with
the
encounter
or
some
other
matter
the
law
enforcement
official
pointed
out
that
after
the
officers
subdued
mineo
they
checked
whether
there
were
any
outstanding
warrants
against
him
finding
one
stemming
from
charges
in
pennsylvania
but
despite
the
outstanding
warrant
his
attempt
to
flee
his
resistance

according
to
the
police
account

and
their
belief
that
he
swallowed
a
marijuana
cigarette
they
did
not
arrest
him
instead
issuing
him
the
summons
the
most
lenient
action
they
could
take
against
him
in
addition
the
summons
itself
was
defective
with
a
return
date
in
january
2008
which
effectively
gave
mineo
a
free
pass
on
returning
to
court
martin
the
lawyer
for
the
transit
officer
declined
to
provide
his
clients
name
but
said
he
would
meet
with
hynes
prosecutors
again
this
week
he
added
that
there
has
been
no
determination
as
to
whether
his
client
will
testify
before
the
grand
jury
my
client
is
a
new
york
city
police
officer
and
he
has
certain
duties
and
responsibilities
that
go
with
his
uniform
and
the
oath
he
took
and
he
intends
to
fulfill
his
obligations
martin
said
washington

president
john

it
could
happen
true
the
math
looks
pretty
daunting
for
the
arizona
senator
as
voters
head
to
the

on
paper
it
seems
improbable
with
democrat
barack
obama
leading
in
every
major
national
poll
as
well
as
in
numerous
battleground
states
expected
to
determine
the
winner
but
impossible
there
have
been
greater
comebacks
the

there
is
just
tremendous

for

donatelli
said
monday
in
between
visits
to
virginia
pennsylvania
missouri
and
ohio
these
polls
that
show
a
huge
disparity
between
republican
and
democratic
turnout
are
just
not
going
to
pan
out
he
said
analysts
have
handicapped
the
race
for
obama
predicting
he
will
win
all
of
the
states
democrat
john
kerry
took
in
2004
plus
a
combination
of
victories
in
iowa
new
mexico
colorado

and
possibly
virginia
and
nevada

that
would
put
obama
over
the
270
electoral
majority
mark
obama
is
also
competitive
in
florida
north
carolina
and
ohio
and
even
once
reliablygop
states
like
montana
and
georgia
are
in
play
the
battle
for
missouri
is
a
dead
heat
still
the
races
in
the

states
are
still
quite
close
with
obamas
numerical
edge
well
within
the
margin
of
error
further
mccain
has
edged
up
in
a
couple
of
polls
in

hope
for
a
major
upset
nothings
over
until
its
over
while
polls
in
a
lot
of
these
key
swing
states
show
obama
with
slimtomodest
leads
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
late
movement
in
public
opinion
said
michael
dimmock
associate
director
of
the
pew
research
center
mccain
would
almost
certainly
have
to
win
pennsylvania
and
its
21
electoral
votes
to
beat
obama
they
said
theres
a
mathematical
way
to
do
it
but
its
an
inside
straight
at
best
lee
miringoff
director
of
the
marist
institute
for
public
opinion
said
in
assessing
mccains
challenge
its
possible
to
come
up
with
arithmetic
that
would
leave
the
electoral
college
vote
tied
at
269
to
269
in
that
case
the
decision
would
go
to
congress
with
the
house
choosing
the
president
each
states
delegation
would
get
one
vote
and
the
senate
choosing
the
vice
president
the
votes
would
be
taken
in
the
next
congress
and
since
democrats
are
expected
to
expand
their
majorities
in
both
chambers
obama
and
senator
joe
biden
would
probably
be
sent
to
the
white
house
said
judith
best
a
political
science
professor
at
the
state
university
of
new
york
college
at
cortland
but
the
likelihood
of
that
happening
is
extremely
small
she
said
of
course
the
buffalo
bills
were
losing
by
32
points
into
the
third
quarter
against
the
houston
oilers
in
the
1993
afc
wild
card
playoff
game
only
to
come
back
and
beat
the
oilers
4138
eventually
advancing
to
the
super
bowl
are
all
those
sports
comeback
scenarios
warming
the
hopes
of
mccain
supporters
we
remember
those
games
because
quite
likely
it
will
never
happen
again
said
andrew
smith
director
of
the

of

hampshire
survey
center
cleveland

all
through
the
morning
yesterday
the
line
of
voters
waiting
to
cast
early
ballots
stretched
almost
two
city
blocks
around
the
cuyahoga
county
board
of
elections
building
in
what
could
be
a
preview
of
scenes
across
the
country
today
of
very
high
turnout
for
this
historic
presidential
election
one
prominent
forecaster
said
he
believes
the
turnout
percentage
could
be
the
highest
in
a
century
and
election
watchers
say
that
could
create
problems
for
election
officials
worried
about
technology
breakdowns
and
flawed
voter
lists
because
of
catastrophic
problems
in
the
2000
and
2004
presidential
contests
an
army
of
citizen
watchdogs
has
sprung
up
across
the
country
they
will
monitor
election
day
activities
with
republican
partisans
more
likely
to
be
looking
for
evidence
of
voting
fraud
and
democratic
sympathizers
looking
to
blow
the
whistle
on
efforts
to
intimidate
or
mislead
voters
the
crush
of
voters
descending
on
about
113000
polling
places
nationwide
on
a
single
day
puts
great
stress
on
the
local
officials
who
conduct
elections
and
they
face
some
new
issues
this
year
just
as
voting
machines
were
the
big
problem
of
2000
and
provisional
ballots
were
a
big
problem
in
2004
the
issue
of
voter
registration
could
be
the
problem
this
year
said
daniel
tokaji
a
professor
at
the
ohio
state
university
school
of
law
partly
he
said
its
because
of
the
massive
voter
registration
effort
for
this
election
and
the
requirement
under
federal
law
for
officials
to
verify
new
registrations
with
centralized
databases
such
as
state
motor
vehicle
departments
or
the
federal
social
security
administration
the
issue
has
produced
litigation
in
ohio
colorado
and
wisconsin
and
raised
the
possibility
that
voters
who
do
not
come
up
as
a
perfect
match
could
be
forced
at
polling
places
to
mark
socalled
provisional
ballots
which
would
be
examined
after
election
day
and
might
never
be
counted
in
ohio
where
there
were
widespread
voting
problems
in
2004
there
were
more
provisional
ballots
cast
than
president
bushs
electionnight
margin
of
victory
over
democrat
john
f
kerry
on
election
day
we
start
shooting
with
real
ballots
and
now
were
on
to
the
next
step
of
these
databases
and
will
find
out
if
these
matching
efforts
and
these
lists
required
in
the
help
america
vote
act
of
2002
really
work
said
doug
chapin
an
election
specialist
at
the
nonpartisan
pew
center
on
the
states
in
washington
the
real
test
is
what
to
do
with
these
mismatches
and
what
the
effect
will
be
on
a
day
when
you
have
100plus
million
people
voting
ive
been
very
vocal
about
the
fact
that
a
state
should
not
strike
someone
from
the
voter
list
just
because
a
computer
identifies
a
match
or
doesnt
identify
a
match
said
rosemary
rodriguez
chairwoman
of
the
federal
election
assistance
commission
an
advisory
body
that
was
created
under
the
hava
law
six
years
ago
weve
advised
the
states
that
everything
should
be
reviewed
by
a
human
to
find
out
for
example
if
there
are
obvious
reasons
there
is
not
a
match
a
prominent
turnout
forecaster
professor
michael
mcdonald
of
george
mason
university
in
virginia
said
that
surges
in
registration
and
heavy
early
voting
could
produce
the
highest
voter
turnout
percentage
in
a
century
since
the
election
of
1908
mcdonald
who
studies
early
voting
patterns
projects
40
million
americans
about
30
percent
of
all
voters
who
will
vote
in
this
election
will
have
cast
ballots
before
the
polls
open
today

either
by
mailin
absentee
ballots
or
inperson
early
voting
while
that
does
not
always
translate
into
higher
turnout
mcdonald
believes
it
will
this
year
in
part
because
of
the
extraordinarily
high
percentage
of
votes
being
cast
by
africanamericans
because
democrat
barack
obama
could
become
the
first
black
president
in
history
mcdonald
projects
that
64
percent
of
eligible
voters
will
cast
ballots
this
year
exceeding
the
most
recent
high
of
638
percent
in
1960
the
john
f
kennedyrichard
m
nixon
contest
four
years
ago
turnout
was
601
percent
of
eligible
voters
prior
to
1960
the
previous
high
was
657
percent
in
1908
mcdonald
said
in
that
election
before

vote
william
howard
taft
defeated
william
jennings
bryan
with
about
213
million
americans
eligible
to
vote
this
year
a
64
percent
turnout
would
mean
about
136
million
votes
cast
in
the
presidential
race
compared
with
a
60
percent
turnout
of
eligible
voters
in

about

the

concluded
however
the

did
not
warrant
referral
to

office
the
county
like
many
voting
jurisdictions
has
changed
its
voting
technology
this
year
to
a
paperbased
system
that
uses
an
optical
scanner
to
count
ballot
markings
but
this
is
its
third
voting
system
in
four
years
for
cuyahoga
after
discarding
flawed
punchcard
paper
ballots
used
in
the
2004
presidential
election
and
a
balky
touchscreen
system
used
in

boras
over
the
next
couple
of
days
to
discuss
where
the
team
stands
in
resigning
team
captain
jason
varitek
epstein
spoke
on
a
lot
of
topics
upon
his
arrival
one
of
which
was
the
multiyear
extension
he
reached
with
the
sox

a
deal
that
had
been
reported
on
for
months
but
without
his
stamp
thats
done
he
said
it
was
taken
care
of
a
while
back
esptein
would
not
reveal
the
length
or
financial
terms
of
the
deal
but
talked
about
his
reasons
for
staying
on
with
the
sox
when
you
sit
back
and
think
about
being
a
general
manager
this
is
exactly
the
type
of
organization
youd
want
to
work
for
he
said
great
fans
great
ownership
and
a
tremendous
foundation
of
our
scouting
and
player
development
which
if
we
dont
screw
it
up
will
lead
to
longterm
success
were
all
in
this
game
to
work
with
good
people
and
to
try
and
win
a
world
series
epstein
wants
to
leave
the
meetings
with
a
good
sense
of
whether
he
can
resign
varitek
a
couple
of
executives
speculated
that
there
might
be
a
new
team
with
interest
in
varitek
the
dodgers
there
is
a
boston
connection
in
owner
frank
mccourt
and
the
dodgers
could
play
russell
martin
at
third
some
of
the
time
another
possibility
is
the
tigers
who
need
a
catcher
to
calm
down
their
pitching
staff
though
they
may
not
be
able
to
afford
varitek
epstein
said
he
wasnt
opposed
to
moving
quickly
on
a
varitek
decision
and
hoped
to
exchange
information
with
boras
that
could
expedite
the
process
but
he
also
feels
the
sox
are
positioned
well
with
depth
where
they
could
go
out
and
make
a
deal
for
a
catcher
if
they
had
to
epstein
said
that
mike
timlin
wants
to
pitch
next
season
but
it
wont
be
in
boston
epstein
found
it
remarkable
that
timlin
spent
six
seasons
with
the
red
sox
epstein
also
said
hes
informed
sean
casey
that
the
team
would
address
more
pressing
needs
which
likely
means
casey
wont
be
returning
the
sox
also
appear
to
be
far
down
the
list
of
jake
peavys
preferences
for
relocation
the
padres
are
trying
to
deal
him
and
san
diego
gm
kevin
towers
has
been
working
hard
trying
to
put
together
a
package
with
the
braves
peavy
who
has
a
notrade
clause
has
indicated
that
he
wants
to
stay
in
the
national
league
and
while
he
hasnt
ruled
out
boston
it
would
be
far
down
the
list
after
nl
teams
such
as
atlanta
houston
los
angeles
and
chicago
epstein
said
he
would
be
open
to
exploring
avenues
for
more
starting
pitching
but
he
didnt
sound
like
someone
who
was
going
all
out
for
a
cc
sabathia
or
aj
burnett
if
it
makes
sense
to
us
wed
try
to
add
another
starter
he
said
in
an
ideal
world
sure
the
more
the
merrier
we
try
to
create
redundancy
at
all
of
our
positions
we
have
some
volume
now
that
can
change
in
a
hurry
with
a
key
injury
finding
value
with
top
free
agents
is
sometimes
hard
to
do
our
expectations
are
realistic
about
the
chances
of
landing
a
guy
like
that
epstein
also
indicated
the
sox
are
in
position
to
speak
to
their
arbitrationeligible
players
like
dustin
pedroia
jonathan
papelbon
and
kevin
youkilis
about
longterm
deals
id
prefer
not
to
get
into
the
who
what
and
where
but
thats
one
of
the
subjects
thats
on
the
table
epstein
said
epstein
has
never
gone
to
arbitration
as
a
gm
in
boston
always
settling
with
his
players
with
teams
more
budgetconscious
because
of
the
downturn
in
the
economy
arbitration
may
become
a
more
important
exercise
in
the
coming
years
the
sox
have
potential
whoppers
in
papelbon
and
youkilis
last
season
phillies
first
baseman
ryan
howard
won
a
10
million
arbitration
case
the
largest
one
to
date
while
angels
closer
frankie
rodriguez
lost
a
bid
for
125
million
and
settled
for
10
million
both
papelbon
who
made
775000
last
season
and
youkilis
who
earned
3
million
could
see
their
numbers
rise
near
those
levels
until
now
the
sox
have
not
been
inclined
to
work
out
longterm
deals
with
those
players
but
that
thinking
could
change
this
offseason
the
sox
gave
youkilis
a
raise
from
424000
in
2007
to
3
million
in
2008
papelbon
suffered
a
subluxation
of
his
right
shoulder
in
september
2006
and
since
then
has
been
on
a
strict
program
that
outlines
when
hes
able
to
pitch
and
for
how
long
the
sox
went
away
from
that
program
over
the
final
month
of
last
season
and
papelbon
did
admit
to
feeling
beat
up
by
the
end
of
the
playoffs
the
sox
seem
to
be
ok
with
their
budget
even
with
the
economic
downturn
chairman
tom
werner
who
showed
up
monday
said
of
the
team
payroll
which
was
133
millionplus
in
2008
well
do
whatever
we
can
to
be
competitive
in
the
tough
al
east
well
examine
all
options
to
get
better
given
how
good
tampa
bay
has
become
and
will
be
and
with
the
yankees
also
likely
to
rebuild
and
be
very
strong
warner
acknowledged
that
a
few
sox
sponsorships
are
up
and
they
have
to
renew
some
business
deals
and
said
he
didnt
know
how
the
economy
would
affect
that
but
it
doesnt
sound
as
if
the
sox
will
cut
any
corners
in
building
their
team

amid
fears
of
an
artmarket
meltdown
an
international
crowd
of
dealers
collectors
and
voyeurs
packed
sothebys
on
monday
night
for
the
start
of
the
important
fall
auction
season
while
many
were
expecting
a
funeral
the
results
were
spotty
a
relief
to
those
who
thought
the
appetite
for
art
was
all
but
dead
but
hardly
the
success
story
of
seasons
past
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
impressionist
and
modern
art
by
masters
like
degas
and
picasso
matisse
and
modigliani
went
for
far
less
than
the
expectations
but
sothebys
worked
hard
to
make
sure
its
biggestticket
items
and
biggest
financial
risks
were
covered
early
in
the
evening
one
of
the
few
truly
high
prices
in
an
otherwise
tepid
evening
went
for
kazimir
malevichs
suprematist
composition
a
1916
abstract
canvas
of
bold
blocks
and
rods
of
colors
it
brought
60
million
a
record
price
for
the
artist
at
auction
but
suprematist
composition
was
bound
to
sell
no
matter
what
sothebys
announced
several
weeks
ago
that
it
had
lined
up
what
it
called
an
irrevocable
bid
that
meant
a
buyer
had
contractually
agreed
to
purchase
the
painting
for
an
undisclosed
sum
on
monday
night
there
was
only
one
bid
which
was
taken
on
the
telephone
by
roberta
louckx
a
new
yorkbased
sothebys
representative
who
is
known
to
work
with
russians
it
was
one
of
45
works
that
sold
on
monday
night
twentyfive
others
failed
to
sell
mostly
without
a
bid
the
evening
totaled
2238
million
below
its
estimate
of
337
million
to
475
million
final
prices
include
the
commission
paid
to
sothebys
25
percent
of
the
first
20000
20
percent
of
the
next
20000
to
500000
and
12
percent
of
the
rest
estimates
do
not
reflect
commissions
most
of
the
works
that
did
sell
went
for
prices
far
below
their
estimates
which
were
set
in
the
summer
before
the
financial
crisis
sothebys
spent
the
past
few
weeks
convincing
consigners
to
lower
their
expectations
on
those
works
that
the
auction
house
had
given
a
guarantee

an
undisclosed
sum
promised
to
a
seller
regardless
of
a
sales
outcome

it
was
clear
that
sothebys
was
prepared
to
sell
something
and
lose
money
rather
than
risk
having
to
flog
it
later
market
jitters
have
been
the
talk
of
the
art
world
for
a
while
now
but
aside
from
dealers
grumbling
about
how
bad
business
has
become
there
had
been
few
concrete
indications
until
last
week
thats
when
a
1909
picasso
that
was
estimated
at
more
than
30
million
was
abruptly
withdrawn
from
the
monday
auction
the
sellers
heirs
of
the
surrealist
painter
enrico
donati
who
died
in
april
said
they
were
pulling
the
work
for
private
reasons
but
others
said
it
was
because
of
fears
that
the
painting
would
be
seen
later
as
secondhand
goods
if
it
failed
to
sell
in
rosier
times
the
painting
would
have
been
snapped
up
by
one
of
the
newly
rich
from
the
former
soviet
union
asia
or
the
middle
east
who
have
been
fueling
the
market
in
the
last
few
years
but
as
the
wealth
of
these
collectors
has
diminished
the
appetite
for
paying
millions
of
dollars
for
art
has
seemed
to
diminish
as
well
sothebys
said
the
buyers
on
monday
were
predominantly
americans
although
it
was
clear
that
russians
also
took
home
several
works
many
in
the
audience
were
watching
to
see
what
new
levels
would
be
set
people
were
nervous
said
susan
seidel
a
manhattan
dealer
after
the
sale
the
mood
seemed
very
tentative
a
degas
gouache
dancer
in
repose
that
was
being
sold
by
the
financier
henry
kravis
and
his
wife
mariejosee
kravis
was
sought
by
two
telephone
bidders
from
around
1879
it
depicts
a
dancer
sitting
on
a
bench
massaging
her
foot
the
kravises
bought
the
work
at
sothebys
in
london
in
1999
for
279
million
and
in
the
summer
the
auction
house
gave
the
kravises
a
guarantee
that
experts
said
was
more
than
40
million
on
monday
yasuaki
ishizaka
head
of
sothebys
tokyo
took
the
winning
bid
by
phone
33
million
or
37
million
including
sothebys
fees
one
of
the
evenings
brightest
spots
was
when
vampire
an
1894
munch
canvas
of
a
man
locked
in
a
tortured
embrace
came
on
the
block
four
bidders
tried
for
the
painting
and
it
brought
34
million
381
million
with
sothebys
commission
the
evening
did
see
some
big
casualties
seated
man
leaning
on
a
cane
a
1918
painting
by
modigliani
that
the
nahmad
family
dealers
with
galleries
in
new
york
and
london
bought
at
christies
in
london
in
1996
for
32
million
was
estimated
at
18
million
to
25
million
there
wasnt
a
bid
in
sight
and
tobias
meyer
the
evenings
auctioneer
gave
up
trying
to
sell
the
work
at
155
million
the
nahmads
werent
the
only
disappointed
dealers
selling
works
on
monday
night
another
was
william
acquavella
a
manhattan
dealer
who
purchased
giacomettis
diegos
head
a
1958
painting
at
christies
just
three
years
ago
for
11
million
on
monday
it
was
estimated
to
bring
6
million
to
8
million
but
again
not
a
hand
went
in
the
air
sothebys
had
given
acquavella
a
guarantee
that
was
said
to
be
about
6
million
making
it
an
expensive
mistake
for
the
auction
house
a
year
ago
a
group
of
paintings
by
the
russian
artist
boris
dmitrievich
grigoriev
being
sold
by
the
berkshire
museum
in
pittsfield
mass
would
have
been
snapped
up
but
on
monday
the
results
were
mixed
among
the
best
was
pipe
players
a
1924
painting
that
depicts
a
pair
of
peasant
musicians
one
telephone
bidder
wanted
the
painting
and
it
sold
for
28
million
32
million
including
sothebys
commission
well
under
its
4
million
to
6
million
estimate
but
shepherd
of
the
hills
another
grigoriev
this
one
from
1920
brought
32
million
37
million
with
commission
it
was
the
only
work
fetching
more
than
its
high
estimate
in
this
case
35
million
the
volunteers
came
armed
for
work
with
shovels
a
jackhammer
and
mugs
of
warm
coffee
in
hand
on
a
brisk
fall
sunday
morning
nearly
two
dozen
came
to
break
a
sweat
get
a
little
dirty
and
revel
in
the
feel
of
a
neighborhood
brought
together
through
hard
work
we
were
just
strangers
before
and
this
made
us
neighbors
said
doug
harper
a
sociology
professor
still
a
bit
surprised
that
something
as
simple
as
planting
crab
apple
trees
hydrangea
bushes
and
day
lilies
could
have
such
a
profound
impact
their
task
this
day
in
the
middleclass
neighborhood
of
south
squirrel
hills
was
the
same
as
at
two
previous
community
planting
days
to
expand
and
beautify
an
unofficial
2acre
park
on
cityowned
land
along
fernwald
road
not
long
ago
it
was
a
weedchoked
illegal
dump
full
of
engine
blocks
car
seats
55gallon
drums
and
leftover
concrete
our
hope
was
that
if
maybe
it
didnt
look
like
a
garbage
dump
maybe
people
wouldnt
treat
it
like
one
said
dr
john
caldwell
an
anesthesiologist
who
is
praised
by
neighbors
for
doing
much
of
the
daytoday
upkeep
and
planning
for
the
site
officials
in
pittsburgh
hope
that
this
kind
of
selfmotivated
activism
which
sprang
up
without
city
prompting
and
with
minimal
official
support
can
become
infectious
leading
to
beautification
of
a
growing
number
of
vacant
abandoned
lots
i
wish
i
saw
more
work
like
that
around
the
city
by
residents
said
guy
costa
the
citys
public
works
director
from
what
it
looked
like
before
its
amazing
what
theyve
done
but
after
the
neighbors
began
improving
the
park
they
realized
they
might
have
a
problem
on
their
hands
we
worried
that
maybe
we
had
done
our
job
too
well
and
might
attract
attention
said
paul
peffer
a
financial
adviser
who
is
teasingly
called
the
mayor
by
his
neighbors
for
starting
the
project
about
eight
years
ago
you
know
some
developer
might
come
along
and
think
hey
i
could
build
there
peffer
began
contacting
city
officials
to
see
if
they
could
have
the
lot
designated
a
greenway
to
protect
their
work
everyone
seemed
to
agree
with
the
idea
immediately
he
said
but
we
still
dont
have
a
designation
youd
think
the
city
would
jump
on
the
idea
what
happened
city
officials
now
say
is
that
the
idea
ran
into
legal
complications
because
the
land
had
been
taken
over
by
the
city
for
delinquent
taxes
officials
had
to
clear
up
titles
and
create
a
new
subdivision
that
could
be
designated
a
greenway

a
process
that
has
taken
far
longer
than
anyone
would
have
liked
although
the
city
says
it
can
be
completed
by
early
next
year
well
get
it
done
said
william
b
waddell
real
estate
coordinator
for
the
citys
department
of
finance
we
already
recognize
this
as
an
area
that
will
become
a
greenway
area
if
anyone
was
to
come
and
try
to
buy
it
from
us
wed
say
sorry
its
for
a
greenway
the
city
has
thousands
of
reasons
to
support
ad
hoc
projects
like
this
one
pittsburgh
continues
to
lose
population
it
is
down
more
than
20000
residents
this
decade
to
roughly
312000
that
is
less
than
half
the
size
it
was
at
its
peak
in
1950
when
it
had
676000
people
in
a
spiral
familiar
to
many
former
industrial
cities
homes
went
vacant
and
fell
into
tax
delinquency
as
people
left
the
city
then
took
ownership
and
over
time
tore
many
buildings
down
as
they
deteriorated
swelling
the
number
of
vacant
lots
the
city
controls
24000
vacant
lots
currently
there
are
6000
abandoned
buildings
1400
of
them
officially
condemned
but
with
city
finances
strained

its
budget
was
put
under
state
control
four
years
ago

it
was
all
mayor
luke
ravenstahl
could
do
to
double
the
demolition
budget
to
4
million
this
year
to
tear
down
600
more
buildings
and
like
his
predecessors

mayor
tom
murphy
had
a
program
in
the
1990s
called
project
picket
fence
that
largely
failed

ravenstahl
has
a
program
to
encourage
residents
to
maintain
vacant
lots
called
the
green
up
program
it
has
already
found
residents
committed
to
maintaining
60
similar
lots
its
a
challenge
theres
no
question
said
joanna
doven
spokeswoman
for
ravenstahl
theres
a
lot
of
vacant
land
in
the
city
but
were
looking
at
this
land
as

sarah
palin
44
is
in
excellent
health
and
has
had
no
major
medical
problems
according
to
a
twopage
sevenparagraph
letter
by
her
doctor
released
late
monday
night
the
letter
is
the
first
information
the
palin
campaign
has
provided
about
her
medical
history
the
release
of
medical
records
is
common
practice
for
presidential
and
vice
presidential
candidates
but
earlier
this
month
palin
the
republican
nominee
for
vice
president
declined
to
provide
any
health
information
or
be
interviewed
about
her
medical
history
she
retreated
from
that
position
on
oct
22
in
an
interview
with
brian
williams
of
nbc
news
if
that
will
allow
some
curiosity
seekers
perhaps
to
have
one
more
thing
that
they
can
either
check
the
box
off
that
they
can
find
something
to
criticize
perhaps
or
to
rest
them

for
palin
had
said

phungs
arrival

excruciating
pain
after

over
70
percent
of

in

2007

who
had
been
in
a
motorcycle
accident
that
doctors
said
left
him
mentally
unstable
was
also
there
and
asked
her
out
on
a
date
she
declined
that
rejection
changed
phungs
life
forever
the
young
man
who
is
now
serving
a
16year
prison
sentence
later
entered
her
home
and
poured
gasoline
over
her
body
while
she
lay
asleep
then
he
lit
her
on
fire
when
phung
awakened
her
screams
could
be
heard
throughout
her
neighborhood
overcome
by
pain
she
fainted

being
taken
by
ambulance
to
da

general
hospital
where
she
would
begin
treatment
for
mostly
thirddegree
burns
phungs
injuries
were
so
severe
that
her
chin
and
neck
seared
together
she
also
lost
all
the
fingers
on
one
hand
and
was
burned
over
most
of
her
body
which
has
caused
ongoing
pain
and
stiffness
that
has
gotten
worse
in
the
months
since
the
incident
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
ni
na
and
her
mother
are
comfortable
and
feel
good
here
viet
ha
said
i
called
them
before
the
trip
and
ni
na
sounded
good
i
asked
them
what
kind
of
food
they
wanted
and
they
said
rice
phungs
trip
to
the
united
states
began
several
months
ago
after
the
childrens
burn
foundation
used
its
resources
to
search
for
the
right
host
family
they
needed
to
find
a
family
that
could
have
phung
and
her
mother
stay
for
about
a
year
and
provide
meals
and
transportation
to
and
from
medical
appointments
after
phungs
story
appeared
in
the
daily
news
earlier
this
year
several
families
contacted
the
foundation
on
sept
1
ha
was
taking
a
walk
in
his
oak
park
neighborhood
when
he
saw
a
newspaper
on
the
ground
he
picked
it
up
and
read
phungs
story
since
then
ha
and
his
family
have
been
eager
to
host
the
burn
survivor
ni
nas
mother
and
father
for
years
have
each
earned
less
than
2
a
day
working
in
the
rice
fields
and
her

had
to
quit

to
take
care
of
her
daughter
viet
ha
who
also
worked
in
rice
fields
as
a
child
in
his
native
vietnam
felt
that
hosting
the
pair
was
the
right
thing
to
do
especially
since
he
knows
firsthand
what
its
like
to
leave
vietnam
unfamiliar
with
life
in
the
united
states
ha
left
vietnam
alone
in
his
late
teens
but
his
brothers
later
joined
him
i
came
here
with
nothing
said
ha
who
worked
his
way
up
in
the
printing
business
and
now
owns
victors
contract
printing
which
he
named
after
his
son
everything
thats
happened
in
my
life
happened
almost
by
accident
and
a
lot
of
hard
work
i
knew
we
were
the
right
family
for
ni
na
in
her
first
week
phung
who
has
refused
to
look
at
herself
in

mirror
since
she
was

settled
into

on
her
neck

she
is
having
trouble
chewing
and
swallowing

and
give
her
steroid
injections
to
help
her
burned
skin
heal
one
of
the
greatest
challenges
for
ni
na
is
developing
her
confidence
said
majidian
who
describes
the
young
girl
as
shy
but
enthusiastic
as
for
ha
and
his
family
their
commitment
is
important
they
said
because
they
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
have
good
lives
in
this
country
which
once
seemed
so
foreign
we
couldnt
sleep
for
days
before
she
arrived
ha
said
i
know
shell
get
better
and
we
dont
want
her
to
go
home
until
shes
fully
recovered
the
fallout
from
sundays
2617
loss

the
miami
dolphins
continued
monday
when
the
denver
broncos
placed
running
backs
michael
pittman
and
andre
hall
on

list
the
move
left
the
broncos
with
just
two
active
tailbacks
selvin
young
and
rookie
ryan

only
three
days
before
playing
at
cleveland
on
thursday
night
young
has
been
inactive
for
the
past
three
games
while
recovering
from
a

injury
torain
made
his
nfl
debut
against
the
dolphins
after
spending
the
past
three
months
rehabilitating
a
dislocated
elbow
its
crazy
torain
said
i
got
healthy
just
in
time
pittman
the
starter
in
the
past
three
games
aggravated
a
stinger
in
his
neck
during
the
miami
game
and
was
in
too
much
pain
to
play
in
the
second
half
hall
who
also
has
had
wrist
and
ankle
injuries
this
season
broke
a
bone
in
his
left
hand
late
in
the
game
the
longterm
prognosis
isnt
quite
as
dire
for
linebacker
dj
williams
who
injured
the
medial
collateral
ligament
in
his
left
knee
in
the
fourth
quarter
he
is
expected
to
miss
at
least
a
month
but
will
try
to
return
this
season
i
think
hes
going
to
fight
through
said
linebacker
jamie
winborn
who
spoke
with
williams
on
monday
morning
hes
going
to
come
through
it
and
hopefully
he
can
come
through
it
earlier
than
expected
still
williams
injury
is
a
major
blow
to
a
defense
already
without
star
cornerback
champ
bailey
and
linebacker
boss
bailey
both
of
whom
were
hurt
during
the
loss
to
new
england
on
oct
20
obviously
were
very
concerned
coach
mike
shanahan
said
of
the
rash
of
injuries
of
the
litany
of
miserable
sights

afternoon
at
invesco
field
at
mile

three
interceptions

pass
interference
call
on
brandon
marshall
miami
running
back
ronnie
brown
picking
up
18
yards
on
a
thirddown
screen

perhaps
nothing
was
scarier
to
the
broncos
than
the
sight
of
williams
hobbling
on
one
leg
and
a
pair
of
crutches
in
the
locker
room
after
the
game
williams
was
injured
in
the
fourth
quarter
while
trying
to
defend
that
miami
screen
to
brown
perhaps
the
games
key
play
williams
made
the
tackle
that
stopped
brown
1
yard
short
of
the
first
down
but
he
remained
seated
on
the
grass
surrounded
by
trainers
and
teammates
for
several
minutes
before
being
helped
to
the
sideline
it
surely
was
an
unfamiliar
feeling
for
williams
and
an
unusual
sight
for
his
teammates
and
coaches
williams
has
been
one
of
the
teams
most
durable
defenders
and
has
played
in
every
game
for
denver
since
the
broncos
drafted
him
in
the
first
round
in
2004
he
has
started
at
least
14
games
in
each
of
his
first
four
seasons
dj
is
our
warrior
you
know
linebacker
louis
green
said
i
never
expected
dj
to
get
hurt
green
and
rookie
wesley
woodyard
played
in
williams
absence
in
the
fourth
quarter
and
coaches
might
now
reshuffle
their
linebackers
winborn
replaced
boss
bailey
on
the
strong
side
after
bailey
was
placed
on
the
injuredreserve
list
after
the
loss
to
new
england
wilborn
also
filled
in
for
bailey
there
in
the
preseason
and
the
season
opener
but
winborn
is
naturally
a
weakside
linebacker
and
he
started
the
season
as
williams
backup
there
green
is
most
comfortable
on
the
strong
side
while
woodyard
like
williams
is
best
on
the
weak
side
i
can
play
eitheror
so
it
doesnt
matter
winborn
said
it
just
depends
on
how
they
want
to
shuffle
us
around
will
the
last
star
player
left
on
the
denver
nuggets
bench
please
inform
coach
george
karl
he
is
running
out
of
excuses
why
his
underachieving
team
cannot
win
in
the
nba
playoffs
under
the
duress
of
player
discontent
and
basketball
budget
restrictions
it
is
nothing
short
of
remarkable
denver
was
able
to
trade
allen
iverson
and
get
hometown
hero
chauncey
billups
in
return
love
him
or
loathe
him
ai
had
to
go
nuggets
forward
carmelo
anthony
acknowledged
monday
that
his
partnership
with
iverson
was
no
more
successful
at
winning
a
championship
than
letting
baseball
superstar
alex
rodriguez
move
in
with
derek
jeter
at
the
house
that
ruth
built
nevertheless
saying
goodbye
was
difficult
im
going
to
miss
ai
not
only
as
a
friend
but
as
a
basketball
player
anthony
said
the
need
for
this
breakup
however
was
as
obvious
as
the
bad
vibe
in
the
dressing
room
on
iversons
last
game
in
a
nuggets
uniform
everybody
knew
this
probably
was
his
final
season
in
denver
but
why
did
the
team
pull
the
plug
on
the
ai
experiment
so
abruptly
to
understand
maybe
you
had
to
witness
the
weird
discomforting
scene
late
saturday
night
after
a
disheartening
loss
to
the
los
angeles
lakers
iverson
normally
the
most
upbeat
personality
on
the
team
in
victory
or
defeat
dressed
silently
in
a
corner
stall
like
a
sad
child
sent
to
timeout
but
down
the
hall
a
close
friend
of
the
33yearold
point
guard
spoke
angrily
on
ais
behalf
and
got
in
the
face
of
a
nuggets
executive
to
issue
a
heated
complaint
about
the
declining
number
of
shots
available
to
one
of
the
most
prolific
scorers
in
nba
history
a
nuggets
bench
that
karl
had
promised
he
would
rule
with
an
iron
fist
was
showing
signs
of
rebellion
after
only
three
regularseason
games
the
scowl
on
the
face
of
center
nene
incredulous
at
being
ignored
in
the
post
by
teammates
after
scoring
22
points
in
a
victory
only
24
hours
earlier
was
laced
with
disappointment
i
was
definitely
upset
nene
said
and
lakers
forward
pau
gasol
even
told
me
man
these
guys
dont
pass
the
ball
to
you

trying
hard
to
look
the
picture
of
maturity
as
he
pulled
a
loosely
knotted
tie
over
his
new
corporate
haircut
anthony
calmly
explained
his
own
failures
in
the
home
opener
but
as
he
stood
amid
teammates
the
denver
captain
was
oblivious
to
the
headline
news
that
would
soon
shake
the
ballclub
from
the
core
for
the
second
time
since
the
summer
trade
of
center
marcus
camby
while
rumors
of
an
imminent
blockbuster
between
denver
and
detroit
began
leaking
over
the
weekend
to
such
an
extent
that
players
throughout
the
league
were
swapping
texts
and
opinions
about
the
iversonforbillups
trade
nuggets
management
kept
its
young
franchise
star
out
of
the
loop
never
mentioning
it
to
anthony
until
the
deal
was
as
good
as
done
i
didnt
hear
anything
about
the
trade
until
i
came
in
monday
morning
i
think
thats
the
most
shocking
part
anthony
said
im
pretty
sure
that
had
i
known
there
would
have
been
a
lot
more
talk
the
extreme
makeover
of
the
nuggets
to
a
defensiveminded
basketballsharing
troop
of
boy
scouts
seemed
doomed
to
flop
as
a
result
of
less
than
100
percent
acceptance
from
naturalborn
gunners
a
clash
of
egos
in
the
locker
room
and
the
failure
to
make
anthony
their
young
franchise
player
a
full
partner
in
the
plans
execution
when
the
going
got
tough
so
now
it
is
left
to
billups
to
lead
players
he
doesnt
know
and
make
karls
idea
to
reinvent
himself
actually
work
the
trade
was
advertised
as
a
3for1
swap
with
our
old
pal
antonio
mcdyess
and
african
import
cheikh
samb
joining
billups
in
denver
but
do
not
be
distracted
by
the
riff
or
raff
mcdyess
left
town
in
2002
feeling
betrayed
and
he
aint
coming
back
anthony
vowed
he
would
make
a
sales
call
to
mcdyess
asking
the
sensitive
34yearold
forward
to
come
play
on
my
team
thats
nice
but
hearing
his
pledge
i
teased
melo
offering
to
bet
25
cents
that
the
next
time
dice
played
in
denver
it
would
be
wearing
a
visiting
uniform
because
the
nuggets
are
going
to
buy
out
mcdyess
contract
and
let
him
reenter
the
freeagent
market
billups
can
play
d
and
hit
the
3
billups
will
drop
so
many
dimes
on
nene
that
he
will
soon
wear
a
1
million
smile
billups
figures
to
age
more
gracefully
than
iverson
whose
lack
of
preparation
for
this
season
had
become
a
point
of
contention
in
discussions
behind
closed
doors
with
nuggets
brass
maybe
best
of
all
billups
can
remove
some
of
the
coaching
decisions
from
karls
hands
why
karl
noted
his
directorship
of
players
on
the
floor
drops
from
80
percent
to
50
percent
involvement
with
the
benefit
of
a
true
point
guard
to
run
the
show
his
instinctive
basketball
has
leadership
in
it
karl
said
of
billups
i
think
the
perimeter
defense
wont
have
as
many
holes
as
many
leaks
as
weve
had
in
the
past
and
i
think
he
is
tough
i
look
at
chauncey
and
i
see
kind
of
a
bulldog
but
heres
the
rub
if
the
nuggets
again
fail
to
win
a
playoff
series
for
first
time
since
1994
who
is
going
to
take
the
blame
iverson
is
gone
karl
stays
camby
got
shown
the
door
karl
got
another
chance
denver
cuts
payroll
karl
keeps
collecting
a
big
fat
check
are
we
sure
the
nuggets
have
solved
their
no
1
problem
mark
kiszla
is
a
sports
columnist
for
the
denver
post
for
the
last
five
years
the
detroit
pistons
were
reliably
good
occasionally
great
and
as
stable
as
any
team
in
the
nba
but
stability
eventually
lost
its
luster
and
on
monday
the
pistons
opted
instead
for
spontaneous
thrills
in
a
risky
bid
to
become
title
contenders
again
the
pistons
acquired
allen
iverson
from
denver
and
sent
two
mainstays
chauncey
billups
and
antonio
mcdyess
to
the
nuggets
denver
also
acquired
the
young
center
cheikh
samb
in
the
deal
we
have
been
extremely
successful
for
a
long
time
said
joe
dumars
the
pistons
president
but
i
also
think
along
with
that
comes
a
little
bit
of
predictability
iverson
dumars
said
will
give
the
pistons
a
different
dimension
with
a
teamfirst
nosuperstar
approach
the
pistons
won
the
championship
in
2004
and
returned
to
the
finals
in
2005
their
284
victories
in
the
past
five
seasons
ranked
third
in
the
league
but
their
core
group
had
aged
and
the
pistons
were
overtaken
by
superstardriven
teams
in
miami
cleveland
and
boston
after
detroit
lost
to
the
celtics
in
the
eastern
conference
finals
last
spring
dumars
vowed
to
reshuffle
the
roster
the
summer
came
and
went
without
a
deal
but
he
got
the
call
he
was
waiting
for
last
thursday
the
nuggets
were
willing
to
deal
iverson
after
a
weekend
of
negotiations
the
teams
struck
a
deal
at
about
145
am
on
monday
some
of
these
deals
you
have
to
strike
when
theyre
presented
dumars
said
in
iverson
the
pistons
acquired
an
explosive
scorer
albeit
one
on
the
downside
of
his
career
at
33
and
with
a
checkered
reputation
a
ninetime
allstar
he
has
averaged
277
points
in
a
13year
career
he
was
the
leagues
most
valuable
player
in
2001
when
he
led
the
philadelphia
76ers
to
the
finals
billups
32
was
one
of
four
remaining
starters
from
the
pistons
2004
title
team
and
their
secondleading
scorer
for
the
last
five
years
detroit
let
ben
wallace
leave
as
a
free
agent
in
2006
richard
hamilton
tayshaun
price
and
rasheed
wallace
are
the
starters
left
from
a
unit
that
was
once

best
rodney

started
in

place
at

guard
against
the
charlotte
bobcats
on
monday
night
but
he
will
soon
hand
the
reins

and
possibly
his
no

jersey

to
iverson
the
pistons
plan
to
introduce
iverson
at
a
news
conference
tuesday
and
expect
him
to
make
his
debut
wednesday
in
toronto
the
deal
left
the
detroit
players
shellshocked
do
we
like
the
trade
wallace
asked
maybe
not
aint
no
telling
hamilton
billups
backcourt
partner
for
six
years
left
without
speaking
to
reporters
prince
sounded
almost
distraught
when
youve
had
six
straight
years
with
somebody
youve
got
that
bond
and
connection
prince
said
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
its
gone
there
are
reports
that
mcdyess
may
seek
a
contract
buyout
or
retire
rather
than
play
for
the
nuggets
if
he
is
waived
he
could
potentially
resign
with
the
pistons
after
a
mandated
30day
waiting
period
billups
a
denver
native
who
played
at
the
university
of
colorado
will
be
asked
to
bring
leadership
to
a
young
sometimesvolatile
locker
room
billups
played
two
seasons
for
the
nuggets
early
in
his
career
the
trade
has
multiple
benefits
for
detroit
iversons
219
million
deal
expires
after
this
season
wallace
who
is
making
137
million
is
also
a
free
agent
next
summer
if
the
iverson
experiment
works
dumars
can
resign
them
both
and
the
pistons
could
remain
a
contender
for
a
few
years
if
not
dumars
can
let
them
go
and
become
a
major
player
in
free
agency
in
2010
when
lebron
james
chris
bosh
and
dwyane
wade
among
others
could
be
available
dumars
called
the
cap
flexibility
a
secondary
consideration
because
we
wouldnt
have
made
the
trade
for
a
player
any
less
than
iverson
beneath
a
clock
counting
down
the
minutes
remaining
in
practice
and
possibly
in
his
knicks
career
stephon
marbury
idled
as
his
team
for
now
scrimmaged
he
sat
face
resting
on
chin
hardly
visible
to
onlookers
or
to
the
knicks
president
donnie
walsh
from
his
sideline
seat
he
was
out
of
sight
but
hardly
out
of
mind
he
was
inactive
sunday
for
a
second
straight
game
as
the
knicks
lost
9486
to
the
milwaukee
bucks
but
he
was
perhaps
active
in
his
own
negotiations
to
solve
a
festering
situation
marbury
a
past
source
of
contention
and
controversy
is
no
longer
visible
no
longer
part
of
the
knicks
plans
and
he
and
walsh
met
monday
in
an
attempt
to
find
a
resolution
marbury
is
owed
219
million
in
the
final
year
of
his
contract
and
he
has
said
that
he
will
not
accept
anything
less
than
his
full
contract
in
a
buyout
on
monday
he
reiterated
his
refusal
to
retain
an
agent
that
steadfastness
could
make
negotiations
more
complicated
for
knicks
management
because
no
one
is
directly
advising
marbury
in
his
dealings
with
walsh
and
at
some
point
perhaps
james
dolan
the
chairman
of
madison
square
garden
why
do
i
need
an
agent
marbury
said
im
not
waived
so
i
cant
speculate
on
that
right
now
i
dont
need
an
agent
and
i
wouldnt
get
an
agent
an
agent
isnt
going
to
tell
me
mr
walsh
or
mr
dolan
what
to
do
theyre
just
going
to
do
the
same
thing
that
im
going
to
do
and
thats
talk
walsh
said
he
had
spoken
with
marbury
and
knicks
coach
mike
dantoni
he
refused
to
put
a
timetable
on
a
solution
but
added
that
he
expected
to
do
so
soon
ive
been
talking
to
these
guys
for
days
and
im
going
to
keep
talking
to
them
and
hopefully
this
thing
can
get
resolved
walsh
said
well
get
it
resolved
but
theres
no
white
smoke
coming
out
from
the
gym
or
anything
like
that
meanwhile
billy
hunter
the
executive
director
of
the
national
basketball
players
association
told
bloomberg
news
that
the
union
might
try
to
intervene
in
the
stalemate
on
marburys
behalf
to
see
if
theres
some
kind
of
mutually
beneficial
position
that
the
parties
can
arrive
at
hunter
added
maybe
theres
somebody
willing
to
trade
for
him
maybe
you
can
do
a
buyout
it
depends
on
the
parties
with
the
focus
on
marbury
dantoni
noted
monday
that
the
knicks
had
other
problems
including
the
listlessness
displayed
in
consecutive
defeats
after
their
seasonopening
win
over
the
miami
heat
were
going
to
get
through
this
he
said
and
dont
be
jumping
off
the
bandwagon
too
quick
because
thats
not
the
smart
thing
to
do
right
now
but
were
going
to
get
through
this
a
confusedlooking
richard

during
the
1968
presidential
campaign
flinging
open
the
door
for
candidates
to
troll
for
votes
in
nontraditional
ways
so
two
years
after
sen
barack
obama
played
a
halloween
guest
wearing
an
obama
mask
at
the
clintons
costume
party
on
saturday
night
live

and
a
few
days
after
sen
john
mccain
hosted
a
faux
qvc
sale
of
campaign
gewgaws
also
on
snl

it
is
a
natural
evolution
of
the
electoral
process
that
the
two
presidential
candidates
would
star
on
election
eve
at
halftime
of
espns
monday
night
football
no
latenight
rallies
could
place
them
in
front
of
as
many
supporters
as
the
12
million
or
so
who
were
expected
to
watch
the
steelersredskins
game
the
surprise
wasnt
that
obama
and
mccain
accepted
espns
request
they
also
taped
interviews
with
jim
gray
for
cbs
radiowestwood
ones
monday
night
pregame
and
postgame
shows
the
surprise
was
that
it
took
this
long
to
so
explicitly
mix
football
and
the
presidential
race
on
monday
night
which
has
been
alive
through
10
elections
maybe
in
the
past
there
was
a
desire
to
keep
the
election
separate
and
not
turn
monday
night
political
said
norby
williamson
an
executive
vice
president
of
espn
which
is
in
its
first
presidential
election
cycle
with
monday
night
two
members
of
abc
sports
former
monday
night
team
said
that
in
their
time
it
would
have
been
the
place
of
abc
news
to
do
presidential
interviews
abc
news
obviously
would
have
had
first
dibs
on
presidential
politics
said
fred
gaudelli
the
former
producer
who
now
produces
nbcs
sunday
night
football
games
al
michaels
who
called
abcs
games
from
1986
to
2005
before
heading
to
nbc
said
abc
news
had
election
eve
specials
and
im
sure
they
would
have
wanted
to
ride
herd
on
something
like
this
williamson
said
that
abc
news
was
supportive
of
espns
monthslong
pursuit
of
the
obama
and
mccain
interviews
and
offered
to
promote
them
on
world
news
tonight
mccain
and
obama
were
not
in
the
espn
booth
unlike
the
celebrities
the
network
paraded
in
front
of
viewers
in
2006
and
2007
before
realizing
that
the
game
was
more
important
than
christian
slater
instead
chris
berman
working
from
espns
studios
in
bristol
conn
interviewed
obama
first
monday
afternoon
from
jacksonville
fla
berman
spoke
next
with
mccain
who
was
in
indianapolis
the
order
that
they
ran
at
about
1010
pm
eastern
was
determined
during
a
coin
flip
by
kordell
stewart
the
former
steeler
who
is
an
espn
analyst
he
said
heads
obama
tails
mccain

williamson
said
it
came
up
heads
the
interviews
were
cut
into
threeminute
segments
separated
by
a
30second
commercial
berman
did
not
give
either
man
a
bermanian
nickname
so
there
was
no
need
to
worry
about
its
presidential
respectability
espn
of
course
promoted
the
interviews
thusly
obama
mccain
boomer

a

mccain
played
espns
game
using
a
berman
phrase
to
answer
the
question
about
what
he
wanted
people
to
think
about
him
as
they
voted
he
could
go
all
the
way
to
the
white
house
mccain
said
moving
berman
to
abandon
the
sober
demeanor
he
had
adopted
both
candidates
talked
about
high
school
coaches
one
who
taught
obama
that
this
isnt
about
you
its
about
the
team
and
one
who
guided
mccain
to
appreciate
literature
and
to
do
the
honorable
thing
even
when
nobodys
looking
obama
said
he
advocated
a
college
football
playoff
he
told
gray
jokingly
that
it
would
be
one
of
my
legislative
priorities
mccain
wants
to
take
significant
action
against
performanceenhancing
drugs
this
was
not
obamas
first
appearance
on
monday
night
he
was
the
star
of
its
opening
segment
two
years
ago
before
a
chicago
bearsst
louis
rams
game
when
he
was
still
teasing
the
public
about
a
run
for
the
white
house
he
spoke
somberly
to
the
camera
about
critical
questions
facing
america
as
if
ready
to
announce
his
candidacy
i
am
ready
he
said
putting
a
bears
cap
on
his
head
for
the
bears
to
go
all
the
way
baby
then
he
loudly
hummed

chief
and
another
district
leader
helped
taliban
militants
carry
out
an
attack
on
july
13
in
which
nine
us
soldiers
were
killed
and
a
remote
american
outpost
in
eastern
afghanistan
was
nearly
overrun
afghan
and
american
forces
had
started
building
the
makeshift
base
just
five
days
before
the
attack
and
villagers
repeatedly
warned
the
american
troops
in
that
time
that
militants
were
plotting
a
strike
the
report
found
it
said
that
the
warnings
did
not
include
details
and
that
troops
never
anticipated
such
a
large
and
wellcoordinated
attack
the
assault
involved
some
200
fighters
nearly
three
times
the
number
of
the
american
and
afghan
forces
defending
the
site
as
evidence
of
collusion
between
the
district
police
chief
and
the
taliban
the
report
cited
large
stocks
of
weapons
and
ammunition
that
were
found
in
the
police
barracks
in
the
adjacent
village
of
wanat
after
the
attackers
were
repelled
the
stocks
were
more
than
the
local
20officer
force
would
be
likely
to
need
and
many
of
the
weapons
were
dirty
and
appeared
to
have
been
used
recently
the
police
officers
were
found
dressed
in
crisp
clean
new
uniforms
the
report
said
and
were
acting
as
if
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
had
occurred
the
attackers
were
driven
back
after
a
pitched
fourhour
battle
in
which
american
artillery
warplanes
and
attack
helicopters
were
ultimately
called
in
still
the
militants
fought
in
ways
that
showed
imaginative
military
training
if
not
sophisticated
weapons
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
american
soldiers
were
at
times
flushed
out
into
the
open
when
they
fled
what
they
thought
were
grenades
but
were
in
fact
rocks
thrown
by
taliban
attackers
the
report
said
the
day
before
the
attack
the
militants
began
flowing
water
through
an
irrigation
ditch
feeding
an
unused
field
creating
background
noise
that
masked
the
sounds
of
the
advancing
fighters
the
base
and
a
nearby
observation
post
were
held
by
just
48
american
troops
and
24
afghan
soldiers
nine
americans
died
and
27
were
injured
most
in
the
first
20
minutes
of
the
fight
four
afghan
soldiers
were
also
wounded
the
intensity
of
the
attack
was
so
fierce
the
report
said
that
american
soldiers
shot
at
insurgents
as
close
as
about
15
yards
away
often
until
their
weapons
jammed
and
at
militants
who
shimmied
up
trees
overhanging
their
positions
to
shoot
at
the
americans
the
attack
on
the
outpost
near
wanat
caused
the
worst
single
loss
for
the
american
military
in
afghanistan
since
june
2005
and
one
of
the
worst
overall
since
the
invasion
in
late
2001
it
underscored
the
vulnerability
of
american
forces
in
afghanistan
as
well
as
the
continuing
problem
posed
by
uncertainties
over
the
loyalties
of
their
afghan
allies
especially
the
afghan
police
the
military
investigating
officer
an
army
colonel
whose
identity
was
not
disclosed
in
a
redacted
copy
of
the
report
provided
to
the
new
york
times
recommended
that
the
police
chief
and
the
district
governor
be
replaced
if
not
arrested
but
the
senior
american
commander
in
eastern
afghanistan
maj
gen
jeffrey
j
schloesser
decided
after
conferring
with
american
forces
that
relieved
the
unit
that
the
district
governor
had
probably
been
acting
under
duress
and
had
been
cooperative
with
american
troops
according
to
the
generals
spokeswoman
lt
col
rumi
nielsongreen
nielsongreen
said
in
a
telephone
interview
on
monday
that
while
the
governor
had
been
absolved
it
was
unclear
whether
the
police
chief
in
wanat
was
complicit
a
spokesman
for
afghan
defense
ministry
officials
said
the
americans
had
never
discussed
these
complaints
with
them
hajji
abdul
halim
deputy
governor
at
the
time
of
the
wanat
attack
and
now
the
acting
governor
of
nearby
nuristan
province
said
monday
that
both
officials
had
been
detained
briefly
and
then
released
we
suspected
them
after
the
incident
but
the
american
forces
released
the
district
governor
after
two
days
of
custody
he
said
in
a
telephone
interview
the
report
which
was
completed
on
aug
13
and
declassified
in
recent
days
to
allow
military
officials
to
brief
family
members
of
those
who
were
killed
did
not
assign
blame
to
any
commanders
of
the
unit
involved

the
2nd
battalion
503rd
infantry
regiment
173rd
airborne
brigade
combat
team

a
unit
that
was
in
the
final
days
of
a
15month
deployment
when
the
attack
took
place
the
actions
by
leaders
at
all
levels
were
based
upon
sound
military
analysis
proper
risk
mitigation
and
for
the
right
reasons
the
report
said
it
concluded
that
despite
reports
earlier
in
july
that
200
to
300
militants
had
been
massing
to
attack
another
remote
outpost
in
the
same
vicinity
the
commanders
at
wanat
had
no
reason
to
expect
such
a
large
frontal
assault
the
enemy
normally
conducts
probing
attacks
prior
to
conducting
an
allout
largescale
attack
the
report
said
quoting
the
investigating
officer
as
concluding
that
it
was
logical
to
think
that
an
initial
probing
attack
would
involve
only
about
20
militants
seeking
to
gauge
defenses
and
the
reaction
of
american
and
afghan
forces
however
the
report
criticized
the
incredible
amount
of
time

10
months

it
took
the
nato
military
authorities
to
negotiate
arrangements
over
the
site
of
the
outpost
giving
adversaries
plenty
of
time
to
plan
coordinated
and
complex
attacks
some
details
of
the
attack
have
been
described
in
recent
months
by
publications
including
the
new
york
times
the
army
times
and
vanity
fair
but
the
44page
report
offers
the
most
extensive
account
so
far
at
the
time
of
the
attack
american
and
afghan
forces
were
still
building
fortifications
of
sandbags
and
earthen
barriers
around
the
main
outpost
and
a
small
observation
post
about
100
yards
away
in
some
places
those
troops
were
protected
only
by
strands
of
concertina
wire
and
a
ring
of
gunmounted
armored
humvees
the
report
said
the
militants
apparently
detected
the
vulnerability
and
moved
to
exploit
it
on
the
evening
of
july
12
the
militants
slipped
into
the
village
undetected
by
the
americans
ordered
the
villagers
to
leave
and
set
up
firing
positions
inside
houses
and
a
mosque
at
420
am
on
july
13
the
militants
struck
with
a
fusillade
of
heavy
machinegun
fire
and
rocketpropelled
grenades
destroying
the
americans
most
potent
weapons
120mm
mortars
and
a
tow
missile
launcher
at
the
same
time
the
militants
blasted
the
observation
post
with
rifle
fire
and
more
grenades
within
20
minutes
all
nine
americans
inside
were
dead
or
wounded
three
times
teams
of
soldiers
from
the
main
base
ran
a
gantlet
of
hostile
fire
to
resupply
the
observation
post
and
carry
back
the
dead
and
wounded
within
30
minutes
american
fighterbombers
were
blasting
the
militant
positions
followed
by
apache
helicopter
gunships
just
days
after
the
attack
american
forces
abandoned
the
outpost
at
wanat
but
nielsongreen
said
the
military
continued
to
patrol
in
the
region
from
a
larger
base
four
miles
away
this
was
a
complex
attack
carried
out
by
militants
who
clearly
knew
the
terrain
and
maintained
radio
silence
he
said
election
day
will
bring
an
end
to
the
negative
political
advertising
that
has
inundated
the
country
but
it
will
not
mean
an
end
to
negative
advertising
that
is
because
marketers
of
consumer
products
borrowing
a
page
from
the
electoral
playbook
are
becoming
more
willing
to
run
aggressive
ads
in
which
brands
attack
their
competitors
by
name
a
major
reason
for
the
growing
popularity
of
such
ads
is
the
faltering
economy
on
the
theory
that
when
times
are
hard
you
should
hit
your
opponent
harder
its
very
tactical
its
very
shortterm
but
today
marketers
are
thinking
shortterm
said
david
melancon
the
chief
executive
of
the
ito
partnership
a
brand
identity
consulting
company
in
new
york
the
spin
doctors
on
madison
avenue
describe
the
tactic
as
comparative
advertising
rather
than
going
negative
but
the
intent
is
the
same
as
in
politics
build
yourself
up
by
tearing
your
rival
down
we
wanted
consumers
to
know
our
coffee
is
bettertasting
than
the
perceived
coffee
leaders
said
frances
allen
brand
marketing
officer
at
the
dunkin
donuts
division
of

in
canton
mass
her
reference
was
to
a
campaign
that
began
on
oct
20
centered
on
a
taste
test
in
which
the
respondents
said
they
preferred
the
coffee
served
at
dunkin
donuts
to
the
coffee
sold
by
starbucks
even
the
name
of
the
web
site
created
for

visitors
to

can
send
friends
ecards
bearing
statements
like
friends
dont
let
friends
drink
starbucks
and
similarly
puckish
greetings
all
were
trying
to
do
is
a
little
bit
of
disruptive
marketing
allen
said
the
campaign
promoting
the

is
created
by

thats
frustrating
he
added
but
you
dont
start
advertising
campaigns
out
of
frustration
campaigns
that
take
such
a
tack
run
the
risk
of
being
perceived
as
overly
negative

judgment

i
had

get
out

time
melancon
at
ito
partnership
said
or
the
campaign
can
be
deemed
unfair
or
pejorative
one
way
to
avoid
that
is
by
leavening
a
negative
ad
with
humor
it
was
very
much
a
question
of
how
do
you
do
this
without
turning
people
off
said
tim
cawley
a
senior
vice
president
and
group
creative
director
at
hill
holliday
who
worked
on
the
dunkin
donuts
campaign
the
answer
he
said
was
to
present
a
scientist
who
improbably
follows
coffee
drinkers
to
their
work
places
to
administer
the
taste
test
so
they
can
cram
it
into
their
busy
day
of
course
to
a
marketer
being
attacked
by
name
by
a
competitor
ads
softened
with
humor
are
still
no
laughing
matter
at
this
time
given
what
the
country
is
going
through
people
are
looking
for
great
experiences
and
good
value
said
a
spokesman
for
starbucks
in
seattle
vivek
varma
lots
of
companies
run
comparative
campaigns
but
the
effective
ones
need
to
be
credible
and
authentic
he
added
if
the
data
is
wrong
or
your
tone
is
off
or
if
you
are
pitching
a
message
out
of
touch
with
what
consumers
generally
regard
you
may
be
creating
opportunity
for
your
intended
competitor
in
other
words
an
ad
from
dunkin
donuts
that
challenges
starbucks
in
a
way
consumers
consider
inappropriate
could
redound
to
the
benefit
of
starbucks
to
followers
of
political
advertising

particularly
presidential
ads
in
2008

as
a
way
to

it
is
imperative
that
the
two
sides
join
to

each
other
to
cope
chen
said
monday
according
to
xinhua
chen
has
also
said
the
mainland
is
again
offering
to
give
two
pandas
to
taiwan
a
move
that
the
beijing
government
first
made
in
2005
that
was
rejected
by
taiwans
last
president
ma
has
indicated
that
he
would
accept
the
pandas
there
is
rampant
speculation
in
both
china
and
taiwan
over
whether
chen
and
ma
will
meet
if
so
this
is
the
big
question
will
chen
address
ma
as
zongtong
or
president
thus
acknowledging
that
ma
holds
a
title
that
in
international
affairs
is
usually
accorded
only
to
the
head
of
a
sovereign
nation
some
90
years

emblazoned

amid

existence
off
the
coast
of

from
this
obscure
slice
of
revolutionary
history
mt
tobin
anderson
has
crafted
a
meaty
and
provocative
conclusion
to
his
monumental
twopart
novel
the
astonishing
life
of
octavian
nothing
traitor
to
the
nation
the
first
installment
the
pox
party
won
the
2006
national
book
award

kingdom
of

waves
candlewick
2299
continues
a
comingofage
story
that
mines
the
paradoxes
of
our
national
birth
its
exploration
of
racial
identity
and
destiny
feels
especially
timely
in
this
historic
election
season
it
just
seemed
to
me
said
anderson
who
grew
up
steeped
in
revolutionary
mythology
that
this
was
the
most
astounding
kind
of
american
story
totalling
nearly
1000
pages
the
twopart
novel
is
hugely
ambitious
and
not
just
because
of
its
scope
stylistically
its
a
tribute
to
the
ornate
syntax
and
elevated
phrasing
of
18thcentury
prose
replete
with
phrases
such
as
reason
enthroned
in
the
pillowed
seraglio
of
the
brain
remarkably
its
written
for
teensand
its
a
prime
example
of
a
trend
toward
greater
heft
in
young
adult
literature
once
a
wasteland
of
frothy
fare
john
green
the
only
writer
to
have
been
recognized
twice
by
the
american
library
associations
printz
committee
professes
awe
for
anderson
i
think
he
is
americas
greatest
young
novelistfor
any
audience
green
said
there
hasnt
been
anyone
like
tobin
ever
for
his
part
anderson
said
i
just
felt
very
committed
to
this
idea
of
being
part
of
this
movement
for
true
literature
for
teens
as
opposed
to
simply
books
written
for
teens
i
just
felt
it
would
be
very
cool
to
do
this
thing
that
pulled
no
punches
if
octavian
poses
a
challenge
for
young
readers
writing
it
was
a
labor
of
hercules
for
anderson
whose
earlier
titlesincluding
burger
wuss
feed
and
whales
on
stiltshad
more
of
a
popculture
sensibility
the
research
demands
were
so
taxing
anderson
left
his
teaching
job
at
vermont
college
to
immerse
himself
in
octavians
universe
for
the
5
12
years
it
took
me
to
write
the
thing
he
said
i
tried
to
only
read
18thcentury
texts
or
books
about
the
18th
century
or
books
they
would
have
read
in
the
18th
century
so
that
means
like
greek
and
latin
things
which
i
should
addhe
laughedi
read
in
translation
anderson
said
it
was
critical
to
wear
octavians
antiquarian
language
like
a
second
skin
because
in
order
to
get
inside
the
mindset
of
a
period
i
feel
like
you
have
to
also
enter
into
its
language
anderson
who
turns
40
on
election
day
is
the
son
of
an
episcopal
priest
his
mother
and
a
computercompany
manager
his
breakthrough
novel
was
shaped
by
his
childhood
in
stow
mass
a
bostonarea
town
with
a
rich
revolutionary
war
legacy
the
first
battles
of
the
revolution
were
fought
by
men
from
the
town
where
i
grew
up
he
said
when
i
was
a
kid
my
parents
would
take
me
to
all
these
reenactments
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
history
didnt
feel
distant
to
us
there
instead
it
seemed
very
intimate
anderson
said
he
couldnt
help
but
wonder
which
side
he
would
have
joinedthe
patriots
or
the
loyalistshad
he
lived
during
that
era
with
no
sense
of
the
outcome
we
can
look
at
the
revolution
in
hindsight
he
said
and
everything
seems
very
clearly
laid
out
and
very
pure
of
motive
instead
if
you
start
to
say
what
was
it
like
to
be
in
the
midst
of
that
massive
national
uncertainty
and
all
of
those
moral
questions
swirling
around
then
to
me
that
becomes
an
interesting
story
anderson
thickened
the
broth
with
elements
of
two
intriguing
historic
events
volume
i
the
pox
party
explores
octavians
privileged
childhood
at
the
novanglian
college
of
lucidity
near
boston
where
he
receives
a
classical
education
and
believes
himself
a
prince
only
in
adolescence
does
octavian
realize
the
gothic
horror
of
his
situation
he
has
been
the
subject
of
an
insane
enlightenment
experiment
to
gauge
the
capabilities
of
the
african
race
such
an
experiment
did
in
fact
take
place
at
andersons
alma
mater
cambridge
university
where
the
duke
of
montague
oversaw
the
education
of
a
jamaican
youth
named
francis
williams
to
test
as
one
historian
wrote
whether
a
negroe
might
not
be
found
as
capable
of
literature
as
a
white
person
williams
ended
up
a
classical
poet
it
just
seemed
to
me
anderson
said
that
this
was
a
very
creepy
powerful
image
in
volume
ii
kingdom
on
the
waves
anderson
places
octavian
in
lord
dunmores
royal
ethiopian
regimenta
perfect
setup
to
explore
the
paradox
of
white
patriots
demanding
liberty
even
as
they
enslaved
blacks
we
also
learn
that
lord
dunmore
moved
by
expediency
was
no
hero
the
story
of
lord
dunmores
royal
ethiopian
regiment
is
one
thats
almost
never
discussed
by
anyone
anderson
said
here
you
have
these
people
struggling
to
define
themselves
and
so
excited
by
the
idea
of
libertybecause
they
of
course
had
so
much
more
to
lose
in
the
cause
of
liberty
than
their
white
counterparts
i
thought
this
is
an
amazing
story
if
i
could
only
tell
it
with
the
us
possibly
electing
its
first
black
president
its
impossible
to
read
octavian
without
wondering
what
it
says
about
our
progress
as
a
nation
anderson
said
that
while
a
barack
obama
victory
could
change
unconscious
perceptions
about
africanamericanswhich
would
be
tremendously
wonderfulnothing
can
undo
the
past
its
more
important
he
said
to
consider
what
were
doing
today
that
future
generations
will
judge
as
monstrous
and
hypocritical
our
impact
on
the
environment
and
the
debt
were
leaving
our
children
give
him
pause
he
predicts
historians
will
say
at
this
stage
in
history
americans
had
a
huge
investment
in
ignoring
the
effects
of
how
they
lived
their
daily
lives
depending
on
whom
you
speak
with

and
believe

the
knicks
are
either
turning
the
page
or
beginning
a
new
chapter
of
absurdity
my
vote
is
for
absurdity
it
centers
once
again
on
stephon
marbury
the
veteran
point
guard
with
whom
the
organization
appears
to
be
locked
in
a
fatal
embrace
the
new
coach
mike
dantoni
has
sent
a
clear
message
that
marbury
will
not
be
part
of
the
teams
present
or
future
donnie
walsh
the
teams
president
of
basketball
operations
hinted
monday
that
while
the
knicks
are
pining
to
get
rid
of
marbury
he

if
not
his
coach

is
entertaining
the
idea
of
playing
him
granted
in
this
drama
of
spy
and
counter
spy
who
knows
the
truth
the
knicks
want
to
get
value
for
marbury
and
know
they
cant
do
it
if
hes
sitting
on
the
bench
in
street
clothes
its
in
the
knicks
interest
to
tout
marburys
attributes

how
he
came
to
camp
in
the
best
shape
of
his
life
and
even
agreed
to
play
off
the
bench
i
think
he
can
play
in
this
style
walsh
referring
to
dantonis
frenetic
offense
said
monday
after
watching
practice
i
think
that
what
mike
is
trying
to
do
is
play
younger
guys
but
on
the
way
to
that
i
think
stephon
can
be
helpful
thats
what
ive
got
to
find
out
the
scene
at
practice
was
bizarre
as
the
knicks
scrimmaged
and
dantoni
coached
marbury
in
full
practice
attire
leaned
against
the
basket
support
watching
intently
walsh
sat
on
a
folding
chair
about
20
yards
away
i
wondered
if
this
scene
seemed
as
bizarre
to
walsh
as
it
did
to
the
rest
of
us
let
me
put
it
this
way
he
said
this
is
an
unusual
situation
i
have
to
talk
to
steph
i
dont
want
to
see
him
just
sitting
there
hes
a
player
i
think
we
have
to
have
some
direction
as
to
how
hes
going
to
be
played
thats
how
i
feel
in
fact
walsh
suggested
he
was
surprised
by
the
current
events
that
have
marbury
in
limbo
as
a
seemingly
permanent
fixture
on
the
teams
inactive
list
steph
was
playing
coming
off
the
bench
walsh
recalled
he
said
he
was
fine
coming
off
the
bench
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
first
game
he
didnt
play
then
that
chant
and
everything
was
in
there
he
was
referring
to
the
we
want
steph
chorus
on
opening
night
at
madison
square
garden
and
again
on
sunday
then
the
next
game
i
think
it
was
a
mutual
agreement
between
steph
and
mike
that
it
was
becoming
a
distraction
with
so
much
attention
so
he
went
on
the
inactive
list
walsh
said
quite
honestly
i
did
not
expect
this
im
not
thinking
its
going
to
continue
then
all
of
a
sudden
here
i
am
is
there
still
a
grudge
between
dantoni
and
marbury
from
their
time
together
in
phoenix
i
dont
get
that
feeling
from
mike
walsh
said
i
dont
get
the
feeling
that
mike
doesnt
think
stephon
cant
really
play
i
think
its
more
or
less
lets
go
with
some
young
guys
see
how
they
can
go
and
right
now
i
think
hes
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
whats
hes
going
to
do
everyone

including
marbury

realizes
that
his
knicks
career
is
over
on
the
surface
the
stalemate
revolves
around
the
219
million
that
the
knicks
owe
on
the
final
year
of
his
contract
marbury
who
operates
without
an
agent
refuses
to
entertain
a
buyout
that
would
pay
him
a
penny
less
nothing
crazy
about
that
especially
for
the
knicks
who
eat
bad
contracts
like
jelly
beans
walsh
said
he
did
not
consider
making
such
an
offer
i
wouldnt
go
to
him
with
that
because
i
wouldnt
take
it
walsh
said
i
never
did
go
to
him
ever
i
wouldnt
do
that
in
this
situation
the
source
of
the
conundrum
is
that
while
dantoni
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
vestiges
of
the
previous
management
walsh
wants
value
for
marbury
who
at
31
is
still
the
teams
most
talented
player
walsh
doesnt
simply
want
to
waive
marbury
without
getting
so
much
as
a
jump
shot
out
of
the
deal
the
stalemate
is
so
bizarre
that
the
nba
players
association
offered
monday
to
intervene
and
possibly
assist
marbury
in
any
negotiations
quite
honestly
ive
never
done
that
before
walsh
said
ive
never
just
said

particularly
to
a
very
talented
player
oh
ok

goodbye
marbury
can
still
play
his
talent
has
been
the
siren
song
for
a
multitude
of
coaches
at
virtually
every
level
so
if
the
knicks
decided
to
put
marbury
in
uniform
for
a
day
or
a
week
or
a
month
what
would
walsh
have
him
do
play
he
said
just
play
he
knows
how
to
play
this
style
too
because
hes
played
it
honestly
since
ive
been
here
he
seems
to
have
been
doing
that
as
far
as
what
ive
seen
hes
played
hard
he
came
off
the
bench
said
hed
be
all
right
doing
that
i
know
what
im
seeing
for
good
measure
walsh
said
there
was
no
rift
between
him
and
dantoni
theyre
on
the
same
page
i
back
my
coach
walsh
said
and
i
believe
in
my
coach
right
now
im
just
trying
to
see
if
we
can
make
a
workable
situation
out
of
this
and
i
think
we
can
im
going
to
continue
to
try
the
knicks
are
home
for
two
of
their
next
three
games
please
lets
end
this
scene
in
fact
lets
end
the
entire
play
a
judge
in
houston
heard
arguments
monday
on
the
legality
of
the
defamation
case
brought
by
roger
clemens
against
his
former
trainer
brian
mcnamee
at
issue
is
whether
mcnamee
was
immune
from
such
actions
and
if
he
was
not
whether
the
case
should
be
tried
in
texas
us
district
court
judge
keith
ellison
who
has
been
considering
these
points
for
several
months
called
the
hearing
to
discuss
with
the
lawyers
their
motions
for
and
against
dismissing
the
case
the
judge
said
he
was
agonizing
over
these
claims
and
realized
the
repercussions
of
his
decision
would
be
felt
beyond
his
courtroom
mcnamees
lawyer
richard
emery
argued
that
under
terms
of
an
immunity
agreement
his
client
was
compelled
by
the
department
of
justice
and
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
disclose
to
former
sen
george
j
mitchell
that
he
had
injected
clemens
with
performanceenhancing
drugs
fbi
agents
requested
that
he
meet
with
mitchell
and
tell
him
the
same
things
he
had
told
them
emery
said
he
did
that
under
clear
threat
of
further
proceedings
against
him
mitchell
was
commissioned
by
major
league
baseball
to
investigate
the
use
of
performanceenhancing
substances
in
the
sport
he
released
a
widely
distributed
report
last
december
in
which
clemens
was
identified
along
with
numerous
other
current
and
former
players
as
having
used
steroids
and
human
growth
hormone
a
charge
clemens
denies
lara
hollingsworth
of
houston
an
associate
of
clemens
lawyer
rusty
hardin
countered
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
fbi
in
the
room
when
mcnamee
met
with
mitchell
was
not
enough
to
confer
immunity
of
mitchell
she
said
we
are
talking
about
a
private
individual
doing
a
private
investigation
for
a
private
client
moreover
she
said
there
was
no
indication
that
mcnamees
testimony
furthered
the
governments
cause
in
prosecuting
drug
users
which
would
be
the
basis
for
granting
immunity
during
the
proceedings
which
neither
mcnamee
nor
clemens
attended
both
legal
teams
also
quarreled
over
jurisdiction
emery
said
texas
was
not
the
appropriate
venue
because
mcnamee
was
not
conscious
of
texas
when
he
made
his
claims
but
was
talking
of
matters
that
took
place
in
toronto
florida
and
new
york
restating
language
in
briefs
already
filed
with
the
court
hollingsworth
said
texas
was
where
roger
clemens
built
his
reputation
and
where
his
continuing
business
interests
are
and
where
he
will
feel
the
most
harm
ellison
did
not
indicate
when
he
might
rule
on
whether
the
case
can
proceed
to
the
discovery
phase
during
which
emery
has
promised
to
subpoena
women
with
whom
clemens
has
reportedly
had
affairs
outside
the
courtroom
emery
noted
that
he
had
paid
his
own
way
to
houston
and
described
mcnamee
as
broke
and
trying
to
eke
out
a
living
in
queens
to
support
his
family
serena
williams
found
herself
far
from
the
united
states
and
tuesdays
presidential
election
preparing
for
her
opening
match
in
the
wta
tours
seasonending
championships
in
doha
qatar
which
begin
tuesday
williams
said
that
as
a
jehovahs
witness
she
does
not
vote
but
that
did
not
mean
she
had
no
stake
in
the
outcome
on
nov
4
as
a
prominent
africanamerican
she
said
she
was
moved
by
the
possibility
of
an
africanamerican
like
barack
obama
becoming
president
i
dont
really
get
involved
in
political
affairs
because
of
the
way
i
was
brought
up
and
being
a
jehovahs
witness
but
its
exciting
to
see
someone
like
barack
obama
have
a
chance
to
lead
one
of
the
worlds
biggest
nations
she
said
in
an
interview
before
leaving
the
united
states
for
qatar
and
its
just
interesting
think
40
years
ago
or
30
years
ago
all
the
things
that
were
going
on
the
persecution
we
had
to
go
through
and
its
good
it
makes
my
heart
smile
williams
said
she
had
not
yet
had
the
chance
to
meet
obama
it
would
have
been
nice
she
said
briefly
back
at
no
1
in
september
after
her
us
open
victory
williams
quickly
surrendered
that
position
to
jelena
jankovic
she
dropped
to
no
3
after
playing
one
singles
match
in
the
last
eight
weeks
well
obviously
i
do
want
to
be
the
best
and
i
do
want
to
be
no
1
williams
said
and
quite
frankly
everyone
thinks
i
am
anyway
so
you
know
i
never
correct
them
i
just
let
them
believe
what
really
should
be
williams
is
21
this
year
against
jankovic
who
has
yet
to
win
a
grand
slam
singles
title
shes
been
playing
very
consistently
all
year
and
she
plays
every
week
so
i
guess
in
this
tour
if
you
play
every
week
you
have
a
chance
of
being
no
1
williams
said
my
goal
is
to
win
slams
id
much
rather
have
a
grand
slam
this
year
than
the
no
1
ranking
no
one
will
accuse
williams
or
her
sister
venus
of
playing
too
many
tournaments
but
at
least
serena
27
and
venus
28
are
still
playing
unlike
retired
rivals
like
martina
hingis
justine
henin
and
kim
clijsters
and
in
this
egalitarian
season
when
in
the
wake
of
henins
surprising
retirement
four
women
played
catch
with
the
top
ranking
williams
had
the
best
record
in
big
events
she
reached
the
quarterfinals
at
the
australian
open
the
final
at
wimbledon
and
won
in
new
york
after
winning
an
olympic
gold
medal
in
doubles
with
venus
in
beijing
it
was
not
quite
2002
when
she
dominated
the
game
but
this
was
a
reassuring
relatively
consistent
performance
from
williams
who
was
ranked
outside
the
top
100
in
2006
and
wondering
if
her
fragile
left
knee
would
let
her
rise
again
williams
43
victories
this
season
are
the
secondhighest
total
of
her
career
after
2002
and
she
still
has
the
seasonending
championships
which
bring
together
the
worlds
top
eight
players
and
are
in
doha
for
the
first
time
that
was
my
goal
to
be
more
consistent
to
play
more
tournaments
she
said
i
love
playing
tennis
and
love
the
competition
and
love
being
out
there
my
goal
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
was
just
to
be
happy
every
time
i
go
out
there
and
just
play
and
that
was
what
i
pretty
much
did
this
whole
year
the
one
exception
was
the
french
open
in
which
she
labored
to
keep
the
ball
in
the
court
and
was
upset
in
the
third
round
by
katarina
srebotnik
coming
up
to
paris
i
think
everyone
expected
me
to
win
as
well
as
myself
and
i
just
crashed
and
burned
she
said
i
was
so
disappointed
after
i
dont
even
think
i
can
describe
in
words
how
disappointed
i
was
asked
for
the
emotional
highlight
of
her
season
williams
did
not
hesitate
and
the
answer
was
not
winning
the
us
open
where
she
leaped
and
then
staggered
around
the
court
in
delight
definitely
the
olympics
definitely
hands
down
she
said
i
just
was
looking
at
my
gold
medal
yesterday
its
so
cool
and
nothing
beats
that
i
can
always
win
a
grand
slam
i
guess
not
everyone
can
say
that
brandon
with
three
straight
victories
and
four
in
five
games
things
are
looking
up
for
the
lightning
to
find
the
power
play
though
you
have
to
look
down

coach
barry

said
at
the
ice
sports
forum
the
good
news
is
were
winning
without
it
if
it
ever
starts
cooking
itll
be
good
news
for
us
it
is
difficult
to
pinpoint
the
problem
both
powerplay
units
move
the
puck
fairly
well
and
generate
opportunities
to
shoot
though
shots
arent
always
getting
to
the
net
take
saturdays
146
fiveonthree
against
the
senators
in
which
melrose
counted
five
quality
chances
only
one
shot
officially
was
counted
as
on
goal
installing
rw
marty
st
louis
as
the
quarterback
has
helped
boost
puck
movement
and
generate
chances
putting
rookie
c
steven
stamkos
on
the
first
unit
part
of
a
fourforward
strategy
has
provided
flair
and
a
presence
in
front
of
the
net
but
melrose
said
he
wants
st
louis
to
be
selfish
and
use
his
big
shot
more
from
the
point
he
also
wants
vinny
lecavalier
to
pass
a
bit
more
perhaps
down
low
to
vinny
prospal
or
carry
the
puck
to
the
net
instead
of
relying
on
the
onetimer
not
that
the
onetimer
is
a
bad
play
melrose
said
but
not
every
time
its
not
there
every
time
for
every
time
ive
seen
it
work
its
been
intercepted
or
blocked
or
missed
the
net
its
definitely
part
of
the
weaponry
but
wed
like
to
have
other
things
if
vinny
takes
it
to
the
net
the
defensive
guys
will
come
down
and
that
will
open
up
st
louis
or
paul
ranger
on
the
back
door
we
just
have
to
have
more
variety
on
the
power
play
its
not
enough
that
is
what
st
louis
said
about
his
one
goal
and
21
shots
in
10
games
im
a
shooter
st
louis
said
im
trying
to
get
myself
into
position
where
i
can
shoot
the
puck
more
sometimes
its
hard
it
was
hard
against
ottawa
as
he
had
no
shots
more
to
his
liking
was
thursdays
fourshot
threepost
effort
against
the
sabres
id
like
to
get
that
kind
of
game
more
often
than
one
out
of
every
10
he
said
i
need
to
get
those
games
every
two
or
three
games
considering
st
louis
averaged
one
shot
through
five
games
and
is
now
up
to
21
he
grudgingly
conceded
its
an
improvement
but
i
still
need
to
improve
two
shots
a
game
is
not
enough
for
me
like
one
goal
after
10
games
is
not
enough

this
is
how
dire
the
bucs
running
back
situation
is
becoming
jon
gruden
hopes
to
get
a
lift
from
a
player
with
a
reconstructed
right
knee
who
hasnt
taken
a
hit
on
the
field
in
more
than
13
months
the
return
of
cadillac
williams
possible
after
the
bye
week
was
merely
a
feelgood
story
until
the
run
of
injuries
at
running
back
starting
tailback
earnest
graham
was
forced
to
leave
sundays
3027
overtime
win
at
kansas
city
with
a
knee
injury
but
finished
the
game
backup
warrick
dunn
didnt
even
make
the
trip
because
of
a
pinched
nerve
in
his
back
fullback
bj
askew
has
missed
six
games
with
a
hamstring
strain
no
wonder
gruden
took
the
unprecedented
step
of
giving
players
seven
days
off
from
practice
its
going
to
help
us
gruden
said
of
the
bye
week
obviously
our
running
back
situation
in
particular
is
very
concerning
to
us
both
fullbacks
both
halfbacks
carnell
williams
will
get
a
chance
to
work
in
this
week
a
little
bit
more
and
well
determine
his
progress
next
week
but
weve
got
a
number
of
guys
that
are
nicked
up
and
guys
that
we
need
back
hopefully
this
week
will
help
us
graham
the
bucs
leading
rusher
with
560
yards
and
four
touchdowns
has
taken
hits
as
a
ballcarrier
and
at
fullback
he
has
filled
in
for
askew
and
byron
storer
who
was
placed
on
injured
reserve
after
tearing
his
right
acl
against
carolina
i
think
he
got
hurt
early
in
the
game
gruden
said
of
graham
he
went
to
the
locker
room
trainers
looked
at
him
courageously
he
came
out
and
played
in
the
second
half
its
a
tough
time
of
year
midseason
for
a
running
back
in
the
nfl
these
guys
are
all
sore
and
beat
up
have
we
asked
a
lot
of
earnest
maybe
too
much
at
times
yes
yes
we
have
but
thats
what
you
do
with
your
best
players
we
got
to
lean
on
our
guy
and
hes
our
only
healthy
versatile
back
going
into
the
game
so
that
was
our
plan
sunday
unfortunately
we
fell
behind
and
we
obviously
had
to
get
into
a
little
bit
of
a
throwit
mentality
late
in
the
game
graham
rushed
19
times
for
62
yards
and
threw
his
first
nfl
touchdown
against
the
chiefs
and
he
lost
two
fumbles
with
dunn
inactive
the
bucs
did
not
make
much
use
of
michael
bennett
who
had
two
carries
for
1
yard
but
the
bucs
got
some
help
from
clifton
smith
the
undrafted
rookie
free
agent
from
fresno
state
who
had
a
97yard
kickoff
return
while
graham
was
undergoing
tests
smith
pitched
in
with
three
carries
for
17
yards
and
caught
one
pass
though
he
also
lost
a
fumble
he
really
helped
us
not
only
in
the
kicking
game
but
from
scrimmage
gruden
said
earnest
went
out
in
the
first
half
and
missed
a
few
possessions
came
back
and
gritted
it
out
but
in
those
final
couple
drives
you
saw
a
lot
of
clifton
smith
as
a
runner
and
a
receiver
picking
up
the
blitz
knowing
what
to
do
you
look
at
him
hes
not
a
tall
guy
but
hes
a
very
thick
quick
shifty
elusive
back
and
hes
a
natural
he
understands
the
game
and
he
shows
great
poise
as
a
player

as
for
williams
gruden
hopes
to
use
practice
squad
players
to
provide
contact
during
individual
workouts
this
week
the
bucs
have
until
next
week
to
activate
williams
or
put
him
on
injured
reserve
williams
is
not
i
am
sure
real
thrilled
about
enjoying
his
bye
week
like
some
of
the
other
guys
but
we
will
have
him
in
pads
today
and
wednesday
gruden
said
he
has
a
great
look
in
his
eye
he
is
very
confident
i
think
in
his
knee
and
what
he
has
put
into
this
we
will
see
what
earnest
and
warricks
health
status
is
and
we
will
make
that
decision
next
week
but
there
is
a
possibility
that
williams
can
help
us
and
that
would
be
really
exciting

rick
stroud
can

stroudsptimescom
tampa
based
on
wr
antonio
bryants
play
this
season
it
has
long
been
established
that
acquiring
him
in
the
offseason
was
among
the
slickest
moves
the
bucs
have
made
in
some
time
but
with
each
passing
week
the
decision
looks
even
better
bryant
had
his
third
100yard
game
of
the
season
115
yards
eight
catches
sunday
and
has
positioned
himself
among
the
league
leaders
at
his
position
and
to
think
bryant
is
still
in
his
first
season
with
the
bucs
and
spent
2007
away
from
football
could
he
be
just
warming
up
i
felt
really
comfortable
bryant
said
everything
is
starting
to
be
like
second
nature
like
ive
been
here
before
the
closest
he
has
been
to
this
a
featured
receiver
making
huge
plays
was
his
1009yard
season
for
the
browns
in
2005
going
into
mondays

game
bryant
was
tied
for
ninth
in
the
nfl
in
receptions
45
and
13th
in
yards
566
whats
more
important
are
his
big
plays
against
the
bears
on
sept
21
his
38yard
catch
in
overtime
positioned
the
bucs
for
the
winning
field
goal
and
against
the
chiefs
on
sunday
his
24yard
td
reception
helped
force
overtime
where
the
bucs
eventually
won
he
was
a
superstar
coach
jon
gruden
said
twohanded
catches
an
unbelievable
catch
on
the
touchdown
after
the
catch
as
a
blocker
he
was
a
great
receiver
on
the
tape
that
i
looked
at
grudens
no
1
gruden
became
the
franchises
coaching
wins
leader
sunday
with
his
57th
postseason
included
nudging
ahead
of
tony
dungy
i
am
appreciative
for
the
opportunity
to
be
here
as
long
as
i
have
gruden
said
i
thank
owners
the
glazers
for
hanging
in
there
with
me
theres
been
a
couple
of
tough
years
theres
been
some
exciting
times
but
i
really
respect
and
appreciate
their
confidence
gruden
is
halfway
through
his
seventh
season
in
tampa
bay
a
bit
longer
than
dungy
who
spent
six
seasons
with
the
team
numbers
game
qb
jeff
garcia
had
one
of
his
best
statistical
days
against
the
chiefs
his
339
passing
yards
were
his
most
since
a
344yard
performance
dec
14
2003
his
yardage
total
sunday
was
his
fifth
highest
rumor
mill
rumblings
surfaced
about
gruden
being
a
possible
successor
to
coach
phil
fulmer
at
the
university
of
tennessee
which
said
monday
it
will
part
ways
with
fulmer
after
the
season
gruden
who
with
gm
bruce
allen
signed
a
threeyear
contract
extension
before
the
season
is
not
thought
to
be
a
serious
candidate
the
plight
of
american
smallbusiness
owners
has
become
a
theme
in
the
presidential
election
but
if
smallbusiness
owners
in
the
united
states
think
they
have
it
bad
they
should
talk
to
john
banwell
banwell
owns
a
cleaning
business
in
weymouth
a
seaside
town
in
southern
england
he
recently
contacted
his
bank
to
renew
his
20000
pound
overdraft

a
31800
shortterm
line
of
credit

only
to
learn
the
interest
rate
had
almost
doubled
banwell
tried
to
tell
the
manager
of
his
hsbc
bank
branch
that
he
needed
the
money
to
pay
his
four
employees
and
his
bills
while
he
waited
for
customers
to
pay
him
he
received
a
written
apology
saying
there
was
nothing
the
bank
could
do
about
his
rate
which
had
risen
to
7
percent
above
prime
banwell
was
able
to
borrow
the
money
from
a
friend
instead
but
that
did
not
solve
his
longterm
problem
how
to
keep
his
business
alive
as
credit
tightens
in
the
middle
of
an
economic
downturn
fuel
and
material
costs
have
gone
up
and
well
have
to
increase
our
prices
but
im
afraid
it
may
erode
sales
banwell
said
money
definitely
should
be
made
available
where
needed
the
economic
downturn
is
making
life
tougher
for
businesses
of
all
sizes
but
britain
famously
called
a
nation
of
shopkeepers
has
a
special
place
in
its
heart
for
small
business
and
banwells
experience
is
at
the
heart
of
a
battle
that
has
erupted
between
representatives
of
small
businesses
and
the
government
over
how
much
help
small
firms
should
receive
as
the
country
enters
its
first
recession
in
17
years
backed
by
a
strong
business
lobby
the
opposition
conservative
party
and
the
nations
two
biggest
tabloid
newspapers
small
businesses
are
demanding
cheaper
credit
and
tax
breaks
after
a
multibillionpound
government
bank
bailout
failed
to
immediately
free
up
credit
though
small
businesses
account
for
more
than
half
of
britains
gross
domestic
product
and
employ
more
than
13
million
their
plea
is
controversial
they
face
arguably
the
same
problems
of
higher
borrowing
costs
and
declining
consumer
spending
that
afflict
larger
rivals
some
analysts
said
smaller
businesses
were
more
vulnerable
to
a
downturn
because
they
depended
more
on
financing
a
large
company
has
more
options
to
raise
money
said
philip
shaw
chief
economist
at
investec
securities
in
london
but
others
said
smaller
firms
were
actually
at
an
advantage
because
they
were
more
flexible
and
could
adapt
better
to
slowing
demand
that
may
be
true
but
small
businesses
say
they
are
feeling
the
pinch
as
banks
introduce
charges
for
processing
overdraft
applications
increase
their
fees
for
managing
accounts
or
request
additional
collateral
for
loans
according
to
the
british
chambers
of
commerce
the
changes
are
a
result
of
higher
interbank
lending
rates
a
deteriorating
economic
outlook
and
the
banks
more
conservative
attitude
toward
risk
the
british
government
tried
to
free
up
credit
by
making
its
bailout
of
royal
bank
of
scotland
lloyds
tsb
and
hbos
this
month
dependent
on
the
banks
returning
to
2007
levels
of
lending
to
small
businesses
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
alistair
darling
met
with
executives
of
other
major
british
banks
last
week
to
persuade
them
to
reduce
borrowing
costs
for
smaller
businesses
instead
of
freeing
up
lending
the
entreaties
led
to
criticism
by
some
investors
that
the
government
was
repeating
the
mistake
it
made
during
the
boom
encouraging
borrowing
businesses
are
anticipating
banks
will
be
supportive
reflecting
the
support
they
have
received
themselves
neill
thomas
head
of
debt
advisory
at
kpmg
in
london
said
but
the
reality
for
companies
is
the
tap
remains
blocked
we
expect
only
a
trickle
of
liquidity
to
return
to
debt
markets
in
the
period
through
to
christmas
that
would
be
bad
news
for
many
of
britains
47
million
small
businesses
and
it
would
infuriate
those
that
helped
turn
small
businesses
from
net
borrowers
to
net
depositors
over
the
last
17
years
smaller
companies
now
keep
148
billion
pounds
with
their
banks
making
them
one
of
the
biggest
group
of
depositors
one
of
them
is
william
n
mullings
who
runs
a
small
jewelry
store
in
london
founded
by
his
family
in
1798
he
is
upset
that
the
government
bailed
out
the
banks
which
are
now
still
reluctant
to
lend
if
you
are
running
a
business
any
business
you
should
be
able
to
do
so
without
the
help
of
the
government
mullings
said
higher
borrowing
costs
are
not
the
only
problem
for
smaller
businesses
they
also
struggle
as
customers
increasingly
fall
behind
with
payments
sometimes
up
to
several
months
late
payments
can
be
a
matter
of
life
and
death
for
smaller
businesses
the
issue
has
started
to
threaten
the
labor
partys
traditionally
cozy
relationship
with
small
business
and
has
moved
small
businesses
into
the
center
of
a
lively
political
debate
about
economic
competence
between
britains
two
major
parties
the
government
is
keen
to
be
seen
as
a
supporter
of
small
businesses
because
they
are
perceived
as
struggling
small
and
hardworking
said
robert
a
blackburn
professor
of
smallbusiness
studies
at
kingston
university
in
london
there
are
a
lot
of
votes
in
small
businesses
and
there
is
a
realization
that
this
is
quite
a
powerful
group
of
people
said
blackburn
it
is
also
widely
believed
that
it
will
be
small
businesses
that
will
lead
britain
out
of
recession
people
running
britains
small
businesses
are
the
lifeblood
of
our
economy
the
governments
secretary
for
business
peter
mandelson
said
the
popularity
of
prime
minister
gordon
brown
has
already
taken
a
hit
because
many
voters
blame
him
for
creating
the
borrowingandspending
boom
during
his
time
as
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
that
is
now
pushing
the
economy
into
recession
the
government
pledged
to
pay
its
own
bills
to
smaller
businesses
in
no
more
than
10
days
but
david
cameron
the
leader
of
the
opposition
conservative
party
called
for
more
drastic
steps
in
a
letter
to
the
sun
newspaper
cameron
suggested
that
small
businesses
be
allowed
to
delay
their
valueadded
tax
payments
to
the
authorities
and
be
given
a
cut
in
some
tax
rates
to
help
them
cope
with
the
economic
downturn
made
in
britain
and
designed
by
gordon
brown
demands
by
the
federation
of
small
businesses
went
even
further
including
a
1
billion
pound
rescue
fund
for
small
businesses
backed
by
the
european
investment
bank
and
a
policy
of
publicly
naming
customers
who
pay
late
at
his
cleaning
shop
in
the
south
of
england
banwell
seemed
to
take
a
pragmatic
approach
i
have
no
problem
with
having
to
tighten
the
belt
and
dont
think
banks
should
be
forced
to
lend
more

they
are
businesses
too

but
the
belttightening
needs
to
be
evenly
spread
the
mets
are
seeking
bullpen
help
in
every
shape
and
form
possible
the
thirdplace
yankees
want
starting
pitching
and
probably
a
good
deal
of
it
so
it
was
of
little
surprise
that
both
of
those
needs
helped
create
a
little
bit
of
buzz
as
this
weeks
gathering
of
general
managers
got
under
way
in
the
posh
setting
of
the
st
regis
hotel
a
place
fancy
enough
to
let
player
agents
fantasize
about
big
freeagent
contracts
even
if
the
national
economy
is
a
mess
first
came
the
mets
in
a
short
interview
with
reporters
in
the
hotel
lobby
the
agent
for
the
lefthanded
closer
brian
fuentes
said
that
the
mets
were
indeed
one
of
the
teams
interested
in
signing
the
33yearold
fuentes
the
agent
rick
thurman
said
that
one
of
his
partners
at
the
beverly
hills
sports
council
had
already
been
in
contact
with
mets
general
manager
omar
minaya
and
that
both
sides
were
expected
to
meet
in
person
later
on
monday
i
think
he
would
be
great
in
new
york
he
really
thrives
under
the
pressure
thurman
said
of
fuentes
who
had
a
273
earned
run
average
for
colorado
this
past
season
with
30
saves
in
34
chances
minaya
left
little
doubt
about
what
he
would
look
to
do
this
offseason
our
problem
at
the
end
of
the
year
when
we
lost
billy
was
that
we
werent
able
to
hold
the
games
he
said
referring
to
the
injury
to
closer
billy
wagner
our
offense
certainly
wasnt
the
problem
as
is
usually
the
case
just
about
every
team
in
baseball
is
in
need
of
bullpen
help
thurman
said
he
planned
on
speaking
with
representatives
of
the
los
angeles
angels
the
cleveland
indians
and
the
detroit
tigers
among
others
about
signing
fuentes
still
fuentes
is
likely
to
be
considerably
less
expensive
than
the
top
closer
on
the
market
francisco
rodriguez
who
may
be
looking
for
a
contract
that
will
pay
him
as
much
as
75
million
over
five
years
in
2008
rodriguez
26
had
a
major
leaguerecord
62
saves
and
a
224
era
if
you
look
at
his
numbers
this
year
compared
to
krods
numbers
they
are
very
similar
in
some
areas
and
better
in
others
thurman
said
of
fuentes
while
using
rodriguezs
nickname
hes
definitely
a
better
value
so
the
spinning
had
begun
with
a
full
winter
still
ahead
meanwhile
yankees
general
manager
brian
cashman
met
with
a
small
group
of
reporters
in
his
hotel
suite
in
a
scene
unlikely
to
be
duplicated
in
the
new
yankee
stadium
cashman
took
off
his
sandals
sat
on
the
floor
with
his
legs
crossed
and
discussed
what
he
believed
was
the
teams
most
pressing
need
starting
pitchers
i
just
know
we
need
starting
pitching
and
its
not
going
to
just
be
one
cashman
said
we
wont
be
one
and
done
it
will
be
multiple
cashman
said
that
right
now
he
was
counting
on
only
chienming
wang
and
joba
chamberlain
to
be
in
the
teams
rotation
next
season
wang
and
chamberlain
are
coming
off
injuries
and
chamberlain
will
probably
have
his
innings
limited
next
season
because
he
did
not
pitch
all
that
many
in
2008
there
is
still
a
chance
that
mike
mussina
coming
off
his
first
20victory
season
at
age
39
will
decide
to
put
off
retirement
and
pitch
at
least
one
more
year
in
the
bronx
andy
pettitte
a
free
agent
like
mussina
appears
interested
in
returning
but
even
if
pettitte
and
mussina
come
back
the
yankees
will
need
at
least
one
more
pitcher
at
the
top
of
their
list
is
cc
sabathia
the
lefthander
who
pitched
the
milwaukee
brewers
into
the
postseason
but
is
now
likely
to
head
elsewhere
possibly
for
a
contract
in
the
150
million
range
the
brewers
made
a
formal
offer
to
sabathia
on
saturday
but
are
considered
a
long
shot
to
sign
him
because
they
are
a
smallmarket
and
the
yankees
and
perhaps
others
are
certain
to
outbid
them
cashman
also
said
that
johnny
damon
would
probably
be
the
teams
starting
left
fielder
and
leadoff
hitter
next
season
who
will
play
center
is
still
a
question
but
the
priority
is
starting
pitching
cashman
said
on
the
day
after
the
new
york
city
marathon
the
roadway
in
central
park
was
still
a
special
place
almost
a
shrine
to
the
millions
of
feet
that
have
padded
through
moving
gingerly
but
proudly
runners
dressed
in
comfortable
clothing
returned
to
the
park
monday
to
have
their
pictures
taken
in
front
of
the
finish
line
they
had
crossed
a
day
earlier
i
heard
japanese
italian
spanish
french
the
international
sound
of
the
marathon
noisy
drills
were
being
used
to
take
apart
the
temporary
steel
bleachers
that
are
erected
for
that
one
afternoon
a
year
the
runners
holding
up
their
medals
had
no
reason
to
know
that
two
of
the
37899
runners
who
passed
this
way
sometime
sunday
afternoon
had
died
shortly
afterward
two
of
our
athletes
did
not
return
home
mary
wittenberg
the
race
director
and
president
of
the
new
york
road
runners
announced
visibly
moved
at
the
dayafter
news
conference
the
road
runners
the
race
organizer
would
not
disclose
the
names
of
the
runners
out
of
deference
to
their
families
but
wittenbergs
shaken
presence
told
everybody
that
there
had
been
a
death
in
the
road
runners
family
too
i
was
talking
to
a
doctor
last
night
wittenberg
said
later
in
a
private
interview
she
said
that
every
person
is
given
a
card
suggesting
a
gift
card
with
an
unknown
quantity
in
it
wittenberg
who
won
the
marine
corps
marathon
in
1987
and
a
year
later
ran
in
the
us
olympic
marathon
trials
said
that
runners
could
work
up
to
marathon
length
or
just
run
shorter
distances
and
that
running
was
good
for
the
health
of
almost
everybody
who
runs
but
everyones
life
is
a
significant
loss
she
added
many
many
others
will
apply
to
run
next
year
as
the
marathon
continues
to
test
just
how
far
it
can
grow
when
it
began
in
1970
it
was
a
quaint
little
race
around
central
park
turning
the
127
runners
into
virtual
hamsters
on
a
wheel
but
since
1976
it
has
taken
in
the
five
boroughs
to
a
nonrunner
the
marathon
does
not
seem
appreciably
different
over
the
past
quartercentury

out
to
staten
island
in
the
darkness
a
tour
of
the
boroughs
a
finish
in
central
park
the
biggest
difference
wittenberg
said
is
the
182
million
raised
for
charity
this
year
with
more
expected
in
the
next
few
weeks
in
the
old
days
the
marathon
had
not
evolved
to
charitable
causes
the
current
size
of
the
race
is
already
putting
stress
on
the
crowded
streets
of
the
old
city
the
mass
of
runners
went
off
in
three
waves
this
year
for
the
first
time
wittenberg
said
the
road
runners
would
study
the
results
but
she
admitted
that
the
club
did
not
think
it
had
stopped
expanding
wittenberg
added
that
parts
of
the
course
could
not
stand
a
greater
bulge
of
runners
for
example
the
right
turn
by
the
brooklyn
academy
of
music
around
the
eighth
mile
the
organizers
do
not
want
their
runners
picked
off
like
basketball
players
running
into
a
tile
pillar
in
some
old
church
basement
gym
in
a
time
of
abrupt
change
the
marathon
needs
its
landmarks
next
year
there
will
be
new
baseball
stadiums
in
the
bronx
and
queens

maybe
good
business
maybe
not
depending
on
whose
taxes
are
being
used
and
whose
parkland
is
being
gobbled
up
and
what
happens
to
the
wonderful
corporations
now
being
subsidized
by
you
and
me
but
changing
the
route
of
a
race
is
trickier
the
tour
de
france
changes
its
course
every
year
putting
stages
in
municipalities
willing
to
pay
for
the
traveling
circus
next
year
for
the
very
first
time
the
tour
will
send
cyclists
up
a
formidable
mountain
on
the
final
saturday
the
last
day
of
real
competition
could
the
marathon
do
the
same
thing
by
arranging
a
run
out
to
coney
island
one
year
a
detour
to
van
cortlandt
park
the
next
its
hard
to
imagine
the
city
rejiggering
its
logistics
and
informing
spectators
who
now
head
for
the
barricades
out
of
habit
what
about
separate
days
for
men
and
women
the
city
could
never
shut
down
twice
or
produce
the
same
enthusiasm
twice
in
a
year
and
the
weather
could
shift
from
brilliant
to
miserable
the
marathon
needs
to
be
an
equalopportunity
spectacle
wittenberg
knows
that
asked
how
big
the
marathon
could
become
she
tossed
out
the
number
45000
depending
on
staggered
waves
as
long
as
the
runners
did
not
step
on
one
anothers
toes
in
the
chutes
the
race
should
always
end
in
the
park
near
the
statue
of
its
founding
father
fred
lebow
which
is
moved
every
year
from
its
regular
spot
on
the
east
side
on
monday
lebows
statue
was
still
over
on
the
west
side
with
bouquets
of
flowers
resting
on
its
pedestal
fred
would
smirk
at
the
flowers
he
never
said
he
was
a
saint
not
the
way
he
was
doling
out
appearance
money
to
attract
top
runners
but
he
was
a
visionary
the
marathon
seems
to
have
passed
into
other
capable
hands
it
wont
be
long
before
they
put
the
bleachers
back
in
the
park
john
w
ripley
a
highly
decorated
former
colonel
who
entered
marine
corps
lore
when
he
singlehandedly
blunted
a
major
north
vietnamese
offensive
during
the
vietnam
war
by
blowing
up
a
strategically
placed
bridge
died
oct
28
at
his
home
in
annapolis
md
he
was
69
the
cause
has
not
been
determined
his
son
stephen
said
ripley
who
at
the
time
was
a
captain
and
a
military
adviser
to
a
south
vietnamese
marine
unit
blew
up
the
southern
end
of
the
dong
ha
bridge
over
the
cua
viet
river
on
easter
sunday
april
2
1972
on
the
north
side
of
the
bridge
which
was
several
miles
south
of
the
demilitarized
zone
some
20000
north
vietnamese
troops
and
200
tanks
were
poised
to
sweep
into
quang
tri
province
which
was
sparsely
defended
going
back
and
forth
for
three
hours
while
under
fire
ripley
swung
hand
over
hand
along
the
steel
ibeams
beneath
the
bridge
securing
himself
between
girders
and
placing
crates
holding
a
total
of
500
pounds
of
tnt
in
a
diagonal
line
from
one
side
of
the
structure
to
the
other
the
ibeam
wings
were
just
wide
enough
to
form
pathways
along
which
he
could
slide
the
boxes
when
the
boxes
were
in
place
on
the
bridge
ripley
attached
blasting
caps
to
detonate
the
tnt
then
connected
them
with
a
timedfuse
cord
that
eventually
extended
hundreds
of
feet
he
had
to
bite
down
on
the
blasting
caps
to
attach
them
to
the
fuses
john
grider
miller
author
of
the
bridge
at
dong
ha
said
on
monday
if
he
bit
too
low
on
the
blasting
cap
it
could
come
loose
if
he
bit
too
high
it
could
blow
his
head
apart
ripley
bit
safely
and
the
timedfuse
cord
gave
him
about
half
an
hour
to
clamber
off
the
bridge
moments
later
his
work
paid
off
with
a
shock
wave
that
tossed
him
into
the
air
but
otherwise
left
him
unharmed
by
placing
the
crates
diagonally
along
the
bridge
miller
said
ripley
had
created
a
twisting
motion
that
ripped
the
bridge
apart
from
its

the

not
have
held
against
that

the
destruction
of

he
enlisted
in
the

out

and
a
year
later
received

schultz
said
but
hes
the
most
revered
war
hero
no
ones
ever
heard
of
this
was
1972
he
added
and
people
didnt
pay
too
much
attention
to
war
heroes
at
that
time
welcome
back
rex
grossman
all
of
chicago
shivers
at
the
thought
but
the
bears
will
probably
be
without
quarterback
kyle
orton
for
at
least
a
month
with
a
high
ankle
sprain
it
is
hard
to
think
of
orton
in
the
same
desperate
way
that
dallas
fans
think
of
tony
romo
but
orton
has
evolved
for
lack
of
a
better
alternative
into
the
bears
franchise
quarterback
and
he
had
been
especially
hot
in
recent
weeks
grossman
rallied
the
bears
from
a
10point
deficit
to
beat
the
lions
on
sunday
his
weakness
however
is
legendary
bad
interceptions
in
the
2006
season
when
he
started
every
game
and
the
bears
went
to
the
super
bowl
on
the
back
of
their
defense
grossman
threw
20
interceptions
against
23
touchdown
passes
for
oldtimes
sake
he
threw
one
sunday
too
enter
this
weekends
opponent
the
tennessee
titans
who
are
80
thanks
to
a
spectacular
defense
that
has
22
sacks
and
is
tied
for
the
league
lead
with
13
interceptions
good
luck
with
that
rex
after
the
titans
its
a
threeweek
journey
that
includes
stops
in
green
bay
and
minnesota
the
bears
are
in
first
place
in
the
mediocre
nfc
north
grossman
will
have
to
be
much
better
than
the
cowboys
backups

and
better
than
earlier
versions
of
himself

to
keep
the
bears
from
slipping
fast
it
helps
that
he
now
has
the
rookie
running
back
matt
forte
behind
him
forte
is
the
leagues
seventhleading
rusher
with
641
yards
he
had
101
yards
in
the
second
half
sunday
when
the
bears
needed
him
most
maybe
the
bears
can
copy
the
formula
the
titans
have
used
with
kerry
collins
who
has
demonstrated
the
value
of
a
competent
backup
pay
attention
cowboys
pound
opponents
with
defense
and
a
running
game
and
make
the
quarterback
win
games
only
when
necessary
cleveland
quarterback
quandary
we
may
soon
get
a
look
at
the
ultimate
backup
quarterback
quandary

or
is
it
a
starting
quarterback
quandary
the
browns
were
3727
losers
on
sunday
to
the
ravens
and
their
rookie
quarterback
joe
flacco
cleveland
coach
romeo
crennel
said
monday
that
a
change
was
coming
we
didnt
do
enough
in
the
passing
game
crennel
said
that
has
been
a
theme
this
year
for
quarterback
derek
anderson
whose
completion
rate
is
below
50
percent
and
who
was
foiled
by
a
confounding
braylon
edwards
drop

confounding
because
edwards
didnt
talk
to
the
news
media
to
explain
what
happened

and
a
terrell
suggs
interception
that
was
returned
for
a
touchdown
last
year
anderson
was
the
nfls
cinderella
story
at
quarterback
as
the
browns
made
a
playoff
push
but
he
faded
late
in
the
season
clevelands
defense
is
largely
to
blame
for
sundays
collapse

37
points
to
the
ravens
on
monday
crennel
said
anderson
was
his
quarterback
as
of
right
now
by
monday
night
anderson
wasnt
his
quarterback
after
all
the
former
firstround
pick
brady
quinn
will
start
thursday
against
the
broncos
but
its
clear
this
is
not
the
browns
year
the
steelers
and
the
ravens
are
ahead
of
them
and
figure
to
battle
for
the
afc
north
the
rest
of
the
way
and
it
will
soon
be
time
to
see
if
they
have
the
right
quarterback
in
waiting
dysfunction
junction
a
scene
in
the
cowboys
locker
room
just
about
summed
up
one
of
their
biggest
problems
after
dallas
3514
loss
to
the
giants
on
sunday
reporters
approached
receiver
terrell
owens
who
had
fumbled
theres
no
question
im
a
capable
receiver
he
said
according
to
the
fort
worth
startelegram
what
he
did
not
have
to
say
was
that
he
did
not
think
the
current
cowboys
quarterbacks
were
quite
as
capable
and
certainly
not
capable
enough
to
get
the
wide
receivers
the
ball
brad
johnson
and
brooks
bollinger
have
been
dreadful
the
cowboys
have
had
only
three
passes
of
more
than
20
yards
in
the
past
two
games
the
teams
owner
jerry
jones
spent
most
of
his
postgame
session
with
reporters
trying
to
explain
why
the
cowboys
who
spent
more
than
80
million
in
bonuses
this
year
thought
they
could
exist
with
no
safety
net
behind
romo
but
it
was
not
romo
or
johnson
or
bollinger
who
was
stripped
of
the
ball
and
it
certainly
was
not
one
of
them
waving
giants
running
back
brandon
jacobs
through
the
defense
but
really
while
owens
thought
he
was
talking
about
his
talent
he
was
actually
revealing
something
about
the
cowboys
foundation
isnt
one
of
the
syrupy
cliches
of
sports
that
teams
win
together
and
lose
together
nobody
should
have
expected
that
from
a
cowboys
team
that
was
assembled
appropriately
considering
they
are
new
business
partners
from
the
outdated
playbook
of
the
early
1990s
yankees
overpay
for
big
names
and
watch
the
team
descend
into
a
quagmire
of
personal
interest
earlier
this
season
owens
complained
about
not
being
thrown
to
enough
and
that
was
after
the
cowboys
first
loss
romo
by
the
way
was
the
quarterback
coach
wade
phillips
seems
likely
to
survive
the
bye
week
a
traditionally
dangerous
time
for
coaches
of
troubled
teams
because
the
cowboys
have
few
options
what
would
they
do
turn
the
team
over
to
jason
garrett
who
was
the
offenses
boy
wonder
back
in
the
good
old
days
of
september
instead
phillips
will
probably
be
gone
after
this
season
if
the
cowboys
do
not
reach
the
playoffs
and
make
a
run
dallas
is
a
spectacularly
talented
team
with
possibly
the
best
roster
in
the
game
but
no
team
has
ever
needed
its
bye
week
more
they
will
probably
get
romo
running
back
felix
jones
and
maybe
cornerback
terence
newman
back
in
two
weeks
that
will
certainly
help
but
the
cowboys
lost
two
games
with
romo
the
cowboys
need
to
win
five
of
their
last
seven
just
to
get
to
10
victories
and
even
jerry
jones
an
eternal
optimist
who
assembled
this
dysfunctional
group
admitted
he
would
gladly
take
a
playoff
spot
right
now
he
knows
how
fragile
his
team
is
but
maybe
team
chemistry
is
finally
taking
hold
after
all
the
latest
big
name
to
join
the
roster
receiver
roy
williams
told
reporters
he
was
fine
after
the
game
the
same
word
owens
used
its
frustrating
for
me
because
im
on
the
sidelines
williams
said
you
cant
do
nothing
on
the
sidelines
he
added
im
on
the
sideline
waiting
i
feel
like
im
in
high
school
sounds
as
if
hes
fitting
right
in
maybe
it
is
best
for
debby
ledford
to
get
this
out
of
her
twin
sons
way
so
early
in
their
careers
so
early
in
the
season
there
will
be
tugging
emotions
for
ledford

and
a
conflicting
wardrobe

when
the
new
jersey
nets
host
the
phoenix
suns
on
tuesday
night
in
the
first
meeting
of
what
could
biannually
cycle
itself
for
the
next
decade
or
so
ledfords
sons
the
7foot
centers
brook
and
robin
lopez
will
be
on
opposing
nba
teams
does
she
clap
her
hands
if
one
scores
over
the
other
or
does
she
simply
sit
on
them
waiting
for
a
less
biased
time
to
cheer
even
she
is
not
quite
sure
i
dont
know
said
ledford
who
will
be
wearing
a
nets
shirt
and
a
suns
hat
to
the
izod
center
i
havent
had
to
deal
with
that
yet
this
is
going
to
be
a
first
for
me
too
ill
just
enjoy
it
and
cheer
for
everybody
a
genetic
rivalry
now
makes
its
professional
debut
brook
and
robin
first
teamed
together
as
first
graders
playing
on
a
secondgrade
team
then
at
san
joaquin
memorial
high
school
in
fresno
calif
and
later
at
stanford
university
when
an
opponent
beat
one
to
the
basket
the
other
loomed
at
his
side
together
brook
and
robin
learned
both
their
strengths
and
weakness
from
each
other
they
started
that
rivalry
in
the
driveway
ledford
said
but
a
driveway
rivalry
is
one
thing
opposite
teams
in
the
nba
is
another
they
prepared
for
the
separation
the
way
they
had
for
everything
in
their
lives
scrimmaging
against
each
other
before
the
draft
in
their
native
fresno
early
oneonone
duels
produced
a
sibling
rivalry
which
in
turn
produced
sibling
bickering
from
the
20yearolds
whoever
lost
ended
up
breaking
a
broom
or
something
like
that
brook
said
a
lot
of
stuff
got
kicked
thrown
around
depending
on
who
would
win
ledford
said
the
beautiful
thing
is
theyve
gotten
along
probably
98
percent
of
the
time
the
other
2
percent
is
when
theyre
in
the
driveway
and
one
blocks
the
others
shot
brook
and
robin
declared
early
for
the
draft
forgoing
two
seasons
of
collegiate
eligibility
they
were
each
taken
in
the
first
round
and
their
straightlined
paths
finally
diverged
we
really
only
text
each
other
when
we
actually
need
something
its
never
to
see
how
things
are
going
brook
said
with
a
chuckle
it
is
a
little
bit
more
than
that
the
twins
affinity
for
the
fine
arts
and
disney
has
been
well
documented
and
when
they
do
catch
up
it
is
rarely
about
basketball
they
plan
to
collaborate
on
books
with
brook
writing
and
robin
illustrating
so
whenever
one
spots
inspiration
he
either
texts
or
posts
a
facebook
message
to
his
brother
like
a
quote
from
the
simpsons
robin
recently
typed
onto
brooks
facebook
page
they
will
become
the
fifth
set
of
twins
to
play
in
the
nba
a
rare
occurrence
throughout
the
league
but
not
necessarily
in
east
rutherford
nj
jason
collins
who
spent
parts
of
seven
seasons
with
the
nets
before
his
trade
to
the
memphis
grizzlies
last
season
regularly
dueled
his
twin
brother
jarron
of
the
utah
jazz
they
also
attended
stanford
brook
said
he
was
caught
up
in
a
whirlwind
of
adjustment
and
had
not
given
much
thought
to
tuesdays
matchup
but
as
the
season
progresses
he
will
probably
pine
for
his
brother
more
and
more
his
teammate
jarvis
hayes
said
hayes
played
alongside
his
brother
jonas
at
western
carolina
university
and
the
university
of
georgia
before
jarvis
headed
to
the
nba
and
jonas
to
coaching
he
is
an
assistant
at
belmont
abbey
college
in
north
carolina
twentyone
or
22
years
to
that
point
we
had
been
inseparable
so
my
rookie
year
was
probably
the
toughest
to
cope
with
because
i
was
away
from
him
for
the
first
time
jarvis
said
i
ask
brook
every
now
and
then
if
hes
talked
to
robin
but
its
kind
of
the
beginning
now
right
now
its
the
fast
course
trying
to
learn
everything
as
the
season
goes
along
itll
get
to
a
point
where
theyll
want
to
talk
to
each
other
more
ledford
dispatched
an
older

with
each
twin
to

them
adjust

life

christopher
accompanied
brook
to

there
is
little
time
to
enjoy
anything
but
basketball
a
city
dripping
in
culture
and
arts
is
only
a
river
away
for
brook
tantamount
to
holding
candy
to
the
face
of
a
child
but
he
has
yet
to
explore

city
in
depth
a

was

after
vince

brook
was
a
mildly
disappointed
but
he
is
on
a
youthful

team
garnering
meaningful
minutes
in

games
robin
starts
his
career
as
shaquille

backup
the
heir
apparent
to
the
man
known
as
the
big
aristotle
as
he
slowly
makes
his

erratic
or
no
court
time
but
a
lot
of
lessons
provided
by

thats
only
going
to
make
you
better
robin
said
of
the
daily
bumps
and
bruises
provided
by
oneal
its
an
invaluable
experience
even
if
robin
does
not
get
off
the
bench
tuesday
night
it
will
be
a
little
surreal
for
so
long
through
so
many

the

stood

in

they
still
do

personally
loyal
and
professionally
peripatetic
a
brilliant
teacher
who
exhausts
his
charges
a
highly
respected
coach
who
almost
appeared
unemployable
now
brown
is
back
where
his
dizzying
odyssey
began
nearly
four
decades
and
11
jobs
ago
he
seems
content
energized
and
happy
to
in
brown
parlance
smell
the
gym
again
after
two
years
in
the
nba
wilderness
but
the
turbulent
past
is
never
far
from
his
gaze
brown
crossed
paths
with
the
pistons
on
monday
a
team
he
split
with
acrimoniously
in
2005
just
13
months
after
taking
them
to
the
championship
he
returns
to
madison
square
garden
on
wednesday
for
a
much
more
fraught
reunion
with
the
knicks
the
boos
and
taunts
will
surely
outnumber
the
hugs
it
has
been
two
and
a
half
years
since
brown
feuded
with
stephon
marbury
lost
a
power
struggle
with
isiah
thomas
and
was
fired
for
cause
by
james
l
dolan
the
garden
chairman
after
a
2359
season
the
ending
was
farcical
and
sad
with
brown
attending
dozens
of
draft
workouts
even
after
his
imminent
firing
had
been
widely
reported
he
spent
a
month
in
awkward
limbo
prohibited
from
speaking
to
the
news
media
at
the
knicks
training
center
brown
held
impromptu
roadside
interviews
with
reporters
and
morosely
declared
himself
a
dead
man
walking
the
scars
have
not
entirely
healed
for
brown
or
the
franchise
thomas
was
fired
as
coach
and
president
last
spring
marbury
who
clashed
with
brown
and
thomas
has
been
demoted
to
the
inactive
list
by
the
new
coach
mike
dantoni
the
optimism
of
a
new
era
has
been
doused
by
reminders
of
the
past

by
thomas
reported
overdose
on
sleeping
pills
and
marburys
exile
now
brown
is
walking
back
into
the
breach
although
with
no
sense
of
vindication
i
dont
get
any
satisfaction
out
of
seeing
anybody
struggling
brown
said
softly
after
the
bobcats
morning
shootaround
look
i
mean
im
gone
and
when
mr
dolan
made
that
decision
im
moving
on
with
my
life
i
dont
blame
anybody
and
i
hope
that
never
came
out
that
i
blamed
anybody
about
what
happened
i
was
the
coach
but
my
challenge
is
to
do
better
with
charlotte
the
knicks
did
more
than
fire
brown
in
june
2006
dolan
publicly
lashed
brown
for
every
perceived
misstep
and
every
violation
of
company
policy
dolan
said
that
brown
pushed
to
acquire
jalen
rose
and
steve
francis
then
turned
on
them
he
accused
brown
of
trying
to
orchestrate
trades
behind
thomas
back
the
list
of
offenses
was
so
long
that
dolan
had
to
read
from
prepared
notes
the
knicks
withheld
the
41
million
left
on
browns
contract
but
eventually
paid
him
185
million
in
a
settlement
brokered
by
commissioner
david
stern
in
interviews
over
the
last
two
years
brown
has
repeatedly
said
that
he
did
a
bad
job
with
the
knicks
but
he
has
never
answered
dolans
charges
publicly
and
he
said
he
did
not
intend
to
it
doesnt
do
any
good
he
said
again
i
was
given
an
unbelievable
opportunity
it
didnt
work
out
i
know
why
it
didnt
work
out
but
its
going
to
always
be
a
personal
thing
he
added
any
time
anybody
tells
you
youre
a
failure
it
hurts
any
animus
toward
the
garden
is
offset
by
browns
deep
affection
for
donnie
walsh
the
new
knicks
president
walsh
began
his
nba
career
on
browns
coaching
staff
in
denver
and
he
later
hired
brown
to
coach
the
indiana
pacers
oddly
enough
brown
encouraged
walsh
a
fellow
new
yorker
to
take
the
knicks
job
i
said
if
you
only
have
to
answer
to
mr
dolan
and
you
have
a
relationship
with
him
i
cant
think
of
a
job
better
in
the
league
brown
said
the
guy
will
do
anything
he
can
to
give
you
the
resources
to
win
brown
offered
his
earnest
hope
that
walsh
and
dantoni
can
succeed
where
he
failed
you
remember
when
i
said
at
my
press
conference
how
important
it
was
for
the
league
to
have
a
good
team
in
new
york
i
wanted
to
help
that
brown
said
if
you
ever
do
a
good
job
as
a
coach
in
new
york
you
help
our
sport
failing
in
new
york
brings
its
own
unique
consequences
brown
spent
two
years
without
a
whistle
the
longest
such
break
in
a
36year
hall
of
fame
career
he
was
thrown
a
lifeline
by
his
friends
with
the
76ers
who
gave
him
a
consulting
job
and
time
to
ponder
his
options
id
have
gone
crazy
if
i
didnt
have
any
involvement
said
brown
a
notorious

he
spent
a
lot
of

at

brown
said
i
never
got
to
watch
other
people
coach
it
was
wonderful
brown
said
he
was
a
better
man
and
a
better
coach
for
having
survived
the
knicks
experience
he
will
have
to
be
to
have
any
chance
of
winning
in
charlotte
the
bobcats
have
never
won
more
than
33
games
in
their
fouryear
existence
they
are
among
the
youngest
teams
in
the
league
two
of
their
most
recent
lottery
picks
adam
morrison
and
sean
may
have
been
derailed
by
injuries
their
bench
is
thin
but
the
bobcats
have
high
hopes
for
point
guard
dj
augustin
whom
they
drafted
with
the
ninth
pick
in
june
oh
its
a
huge
challenge
brown
said
i
dont
think
it
will
happen
overnight
as
homecomings
go
this
one
seems
to
hold
more
promise
or
at
least
less
drama
in
new
york
brown
was
promoted
as
a
franchise
savior
although
the
odds
were
always
against
him
succeeding
in
charlotte
the
expectations
and
pressure
are
lower
the
environment
friendlier
and
less
frantic

if
this
is

stop
on

magical

at

68
he
insists
it
is
the
gratification
will
come
from
simple
achievements
and
mostly
just
from
being
back
on

ive
always
appreciated
having

would
not

we
seem
to
prefer
an
informal

relationship
with
our
movie
stars
but
there
was
a
time
when
a
more
decorous
paternal
authority
was
in
fashion
the
sort
of
authority
that
gregory
peck
projected
over
the
course
of
his
long
career
pecks
gift
for
combining
emotional
distance
and
moral
compassion
is
best
represented
by
his
most
famous
role
the
transcendently
decent
smalltown
lawyer
atticus
finch
in
to
kill
a

robert

1962
adaptation
of

like
john
wayne
his
ideological
opposite
peck
became
a
star
during

war
ii
thanks
partly
to
the
shortage
of
leading
men
many
of
the
more
established
actors
having
been
called
into
service
as
a
father
of
four
wayne
had
a
family
exemption
peck
was
passed
over
because
of
a
bad
back
injured
during
studio
dancing
lessons
led
by
martha
graham
and
yet
and
in
very
different
ways
wayne
and
peck
came
to
embody
the
figure
of
the
american
fighting
man
wayne
as
an
active
combatant
and
peck

in
a
series
of
films
that
included
twelve
oclock
high
1949
and
the
man
in
the
gray
flannel
suit
1956

as
the
sadly
matured
returning
vet
even
in
films
that
werent
related
to
war
the
crisis
of
pecks
character
was
often
that
of
the
former
man
of
action
now
hemmed
in
by
family
responsibilities
and
social
restraints
by
the
1960s
when
peck
was
working
consistently
at
universal
he
had
acquired
a
sort
of
elderstatesman
status
he
often
played
a
middleaged
hero
whose
greatest
accomplishments
might
be
behind
him
but
who
is
still
capable
of
rising
to
the
occasion
the
most
famous
example
is
the
southern
district
attorney
in
cape
fear
who
goes
to
extreme
measures
to
protect
his
family
from
a
roving
psychopath
robert
mitchum
he
once
sent
to
prison
captain
newman
md
is
a
more
or
less
explicit
attempt
to
extend
the
franchise
of
to
kill
a
mockingbird
with
peck
as
an
army
psychiatrist
in
world
war
ii
tending
with
warmth
and
humor
to
the
broken
minds
of
soldiers
sent
back
from
the
front
it
is
an
ideal
role
for
him
but
the
film
is
flatly
directed
and
episodic
the
supporting
characters
are
presented
as
simple
psychological
riddles

a
guiltridden
flier
bobby
darin
a
schizophrenic
colonel
eddie
albert
and
so
on

that
captain
newman
solves
with
a
single
penetrating
insight
far
more
interesting
is
mirage
a
cleverly
plotted
blackandwhite
thriller
written
by
peter
stone
whose
screenplay
for
charade
had
just
proved
a
big
hit
for
cary
grant
audrey
hepburn
and
the
director
stanley
donen
the
more
somber
mirage
blends
pecks
gray
flannel
persona
with
elements
of
his
amnesia
victim
in
alfred
hitchcocks
spellbound
1945
here
he
is
a
corporate
functionary
who
finds
after
an
electrical
blackout
in
his
manhattan
office
tower
that
he
has
no
real
idea
of
who
he
is
or
how
he
has
spent
the
last
two
years
as
in
charade
none
of
the
characters
are
quite
who
they
seem
to
be
and
the
solution
to
the
mystery
revealed
in
small
increments
calls
on
cold
war
paranoia
in
ways
that
evoke
the
manchurian
candidate
stone
under
the
pseudonym
pierre
marton
also
contributed
to
the
screenplay
of
arabesque
a
sardonic
thriller
directed
in
high
style
by
donen
as
a
direct
followup
to
charade
but
this
time
peck
is
miscast
in
a
role

an
academic
specialist
in
hieroglyphics
drawn
into
middle
eastern
intrigue

that
seems
tailormade
for
grants
playfulness
and
selfmockery
two
qualities
not
among
pecks
professional
attributes
in
the
most
memorable
sequence
a
fully
clothed
peck
finds
himself
in
a
shower
stall
with
the
villains
treacherous
mistress
sophia
loren
and
must
keep
his
eyes
and
mind
off
lorens
spectacular
nudity
or
risk
revealing
his
presence
where
erotic
agony
is
required
peck
can
summon
only
a
sense
of
embarrassment
the
revelation
of
the
universal
set
is
an
eyepopping
technicolor
restoration
of
the
world
in
his
arms
one
of
two
films
the
other
is
warner
brothers
captain
horatio
hornblower
in
which
peck
collaborated
with
the
great
action
director
raoul
walsh
walsh
who
someday
will
be
granted
the
place
he
deserves
alongside
john
ford
and
howard
hawks
often
told
stories
of
adventurer
heroes
with
wild
ambitions
and
unfettered
appetites
figures
who
found
their
most
satisfying
incarnation
in
errol
flynn
at
first
peck
hardly
seems
to
fit
the
mold

for
one
thing
he
cant
throw
a
convincing
stage
punch
a
basic
requirement
for
the
walshian
hero

but
he
seems
to
expand
in
stature
as
the
world
in
his
arms
progresses
walsh
brings
out
the
natural
athlete
in
the
6foot3
peck
who
had
been
on
the
rowing
team
at
the
university
of
california
berkeley
good
preparation
perhaps
for
this
seagoing
swashbuckler
about
a
sealhunting
captain
in
1850
who
romances
a
russian
princess
ann
blyth
while
dreaming
of

cry
of

perpetuating

a

anxiety
about

problem
you
might
say
goes
back
to

the

noted

to
boast
for
good
reason
that
with
more
than
220
films
made
here
a

the
countrys
movie
industry
lags
behind
only
those
of
india
and
the

among
these
220
movies
a
modest
number
of
highquality
documentaries
or
fictional
dramas
detailing
poverty
or
immigrant
life
here
are
released
but
theyre
generally
small
films
made
in
the
shadows
frodon
said
as
antoine
de
baecque
a
film
historian
put
it
french
cinema
since
nouvelle
vague
deals
with
reality
in
a
certain
way
he
was
talking
the
other
afternoon
about
the
french
new
wave
of
the
late
1950s
and
60s
led
by
francois
truffaut
and
godard
we
like
to
fracture
distort
and
romanticize

to
see
trauma
but
obliquely
abstractly
in
this
sense
french
cinema
is
the
opposite
of
american
cinema
it
values
style
over
realism
the
small
form
over
the
epic
de
baecque
chalked
this
approach
up
to
a
french
inferiority
complex
a
feeling
that
since
world
war
ii
france
despite
what
we
like
to
tell
ourselves
is
downgraded
from
the
front
rank
of
history
which
creates
melancholy
a
malaise
he
said
the
romantic
comedies
the
sentimental
affairs
they
are
fictions
that
remove
us
from
real
life
and
are
precisely
the

that

the
court
and
fleeting
expletives
the
supreme
court
hears
arguments
on
tuesday
in
an
important
freespeech
case
in
2004
the
federal
communications
commission
broke
with
longheld
policy
and
began
imposing
fines
on
broadcasters
for
carrying
an
occasional
vulgarity

sometimes
a
single
word
uttered
in
a
live
broadcast
the
new
policy
which
a
federal
appeals
court
struck
down
last
year
has
had
a
chilling
effect
on
important
speech
the
fcc
has
turned
itself
into
a
censorship
board
that
imposes
fines
based
on
its
own
highly
subjective
standards
it
declared
that
a
golden
globes
award
show
in
which
the
singer
bono
uttered
one
vulgar
word
was
indecent
it
fined
a
small
public
television
station
in
california
for
airing
martin
scorseses
documentary
the
blues
which
contains
musicians
using
some
earthy
language
the
commission
has
decided
that
other
programming
with
similar
language
is
not
indecent
this
regime
is
a
serious
threat
to
free
expression
and
constitutionally
protected
speech
just
as
troubling
broadcasters
are
engaging
in
selfcensorship

refraining
from
airing
speech
that
should
be
protected
out
of
fear
of
facing
fcc
fines
based
on
vague
rules
the
new
yorkbased
2nd
us
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
fccs
fleeting
expletives
policy
is
arbitrary
and
capricious

and
therefore
invalid
the
fccs
decision
to
abandon
its
more
lenient
policy
was
not
properly
reasoned
the
court
ruled
the
2nd
circuits
decision
is
correct
and
the
supreme
court
should
affirm
it
however
there
also
are
important
constitutional
law
issues
at
stake
which
the
appeals
court
did
not
reach
the
fcc
is
penalizing
broadcasters
for
airing
speech
protected
by
the
first
amendment
the
vague
standards
it
has
adopted
do
not
meet
constitutional
muster
we
hope
the
next
president
will
appoint
commissioners
with
a
greater
respect
for
the
first
amendment
until
that
happens
the
supreme
court
must
ensure
that
the
fcc
does
not
trample
on
freespeech
rights
so
little
time
so
much
damage
while
americans
eagerly
vote
for
the
next
president
heres
a
sobering
reminder
as
of
tuesday
george
w
bush
still
has
77
days
left
in
the
white
house

and
hes
not
wasting
a
minute
president
bushs
aides
have
been
scrambling
to
change
rules
and
regulations
on
the
environment
civil
liberties
and
abortion
rights
among
others

few
for
the
good
most
presidents
put
on
a
lastminute
policy
stamp
but
in
bushs
case
it
is
more
like
a
wrecking
ball
we
fear
it
could
take
months
or
years
for
the
next
president
to
identify
and
then
undo
all
of
the
damage
here
is
a
look

by
no
means
comprehensive

at
some
of
bushs
recent
parting
gifts
and
those
we
fear
are
yet
to
come
civil
liberties
we
dont
know
all
of
the
ways
that
the
administration
has
violated
americans
rights
in
the
name
of
fighting
terrorism
last
month
attorney
general
michael
mukasey
rushed
out
new
guidelines
for
the
fbi
that
permit
agents
to
use
chillingly
intrusive
techniques
to
collect
information
on
americans
even
where
there
is
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
agents
will
be
allowed
to
use
informants
to
infiltrate
lawful
groups
engage
in
prolonged
physical
surveillance
and
lie
about
their
identity
while
questioning
a
subjects
neighbors
relatives
coworkers
and
friends
the
changes
also
give
the
fbi

which
has
a
long
history
of
spying
on
civil
rights
groups
and
others

expanded
latitude
to
use
these
techniques
on
people
identified
by
racial
ethnic
and
religious
background
the
administration
showed
further
disdain
for
americans
privacy
rights
and
for
congress
power
by
making
clear
that
it
will
ignore
a
provision
in
the
legislation
that
established
the
department
of
homeland
security
the
law
requires
the
departments
privacy
officer
to
account
annually
for
any
activity
that
could
affect
americans
privacy

and
clearly
stipulates
that
the
report
cannot
be
edited
by
any
other
officials
at
the
department
or
the
white
house
the
justice
departments
office
of
legal
counsel
has
released
a
memo
asserting
that
the
law
does
not
prohibit
officials
from
homeland
security
or
the
white
house
from
reviewing
the
report
the
memo
then
argues
that
since
the
law
allows
the
officials
to
review
the
report
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
stop
them
from
changing
it
george
orwell
couldnt
have
done
better
the
environment
the
administration
has
been
especially
busy
weakening
regulations
that
promote
clean
air
and
clean
water
and
protect
endangered
species
bush
or
more
to
the
point
vice
president
dick
cheney
came
to
office
determined
to
dismantle
bill
clintons
environmental
legacy
undo
decades
of
environmental
law
and
keep
their
friends
in
industry
happy
they
have
had
less
success
than
we
feared
but
only
because
of
the
determined
opposition
of
environmental
groups
courageous
members
of
congress
and
protests
from
citizens
but
the
white
house
keeps
trying
bushs
secretary
of
the
interior
dirk
kempthorne
has
recently
carved
out
significant
exceptions
to
regulations
requiring
expert
scientific
review
of
any
federal
project
that
might
harm
endangered
or
threatened
species
one
consequence
will
be
to
relieve
the
agency
of
the
need
to
assess
the
impact
of
global
warming
on
atrisk
species
the
department
also
is
rushing
to
remove
the
gray
wolf
from
the
endangered
species
list

again
the
wolves
were
relisted
after
a
federal
judge
ruled
the
government
had
not
lived
up
to
its
own
recovery
plan
in
coming
weeks
we
expect
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
issue
a
final
rule
that
would
weaken
a
program
created
by
the
clean
air
act
which
requires
utilities
to
install
modern
pollution
controls
when
they
upgrade
their
plants
to
produce
more
power
the
agency
is
also
expected
to
issue
a
final
rule
that
would
make
it
easier
for
coalfired
power
plants
to
locate
near
national
parks
in
defiance
of
longstanding
congressional
mandates
to
protect
air
quality
in
areas
of
special
natural
or
recreational
value
interior
is
also
awaiting
epas
concurrence
on
a
proposal
that
would
make
it
easier
for
mining
companies
to
dump
toxic
mine
wastes
in
valleys
and
streams
and
while
no
rules
changes
are
at
issue
the
interior
department
also
has
been
rushing
to
open
up
millions
of
acres
of
pristine
federal
land
to
oilandgas
exploration
we
fear
that
in
coming
weeks
kempthorne
will
open
up
even
more
acreage
to
the
commercial
development
of
oil
shale
a
hugely
expensive
and
environmentally
risky
process
that
even
the
oil
companies
seem
in
no
hurry
to
begin
he
should
not
abortion
rights
soon
after
the
election
michael
leavitt
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
is
expected
to
issue
new
regulations
aimed
at
further
limiting
womens
access
to
abortion
contraceptives
and
information
about
their
reproductive
health
care
options
existing
law
allows
doctors
and
nurses
to
refuse
to
participate
in
an
abortion
these
changes
would
extend
the
socalled
right
to
refuse
to
a
wide
range
of
health
care
workers
and
activities
including
abortion
referrals
unbiased
counseling
and
provision
of
birth
control
pills
or
emergency
contraception
even
for
rape
victims
the
administration
has
taken
other
disturbing
steps
in
recent
weeks
in
late
september
the
irs
restored
tax
breaks
for
banks
that
take
big
losses
on
bad
loans
inherited
through
acquisitions
now
we
learn
that
jpmorgan
chase
and
others
are
planning
to
use
their
bailout
funds
for
mergers
and
acquisitions
transactions
that
will
be
greatly
enhanced
by
the
new
tax
subsidy
one
lastminute
change
bush
wont
be
making
he
apparently
has
decided
not
to
shut
down
the
prison
in
guantanamo
bay
cuba

the
most
shameful
symbol
of
this
administrations
disdain
for
the
rule
of
law
bush
has
said
it
should
be
closed
and
his
secretary
of
state
condoleezza
rice
and
his
secretary
of
defense
robert
gates
pushed
for
it
proposals
were
prepared
including
a
plan
for
sending
the
real
bad
guys
to
other
countries
for
trial
but
cheney
objected
and
the
president
has
refused
even
to
review
the
memos
he
will
hand
this
mess
off
to
his
successor
we
suppose
there
is
some
good
news
in
all
of
this
while
bush
leaves
office
on
jan
20
2009
he
has
only
until
nov
20
of
this
year
to
issue
economically
significant
rule
changes
and
until
dec
20
to
issue
other
changes
anything
after
that
is
merely
a
draft
and
can
be
easily
withdrawn
by
the
next
president
unfortunately
the
white
house
is
well
aware
of
those
deadlines

the
iranian
parliament
voted
to
dismiss
a
top
minister
on
tuesday
in
a
setback
for
president
mahmoud
ahmadinejad
eight
months
before
he
faces
presidential
elections
the
parliament
dismissed
the
official
ali
kordan
the
interior
minister
after
he
admitted
to
faking
his
university
degree
and
tried
to
bribe
members
of
parliament
not
to
impeach
him
the
dismissal
underlines
the
assertiveness
of
the
parliament
at
a
time
ahmadinejad
is
struggling
to
cope
with
a
growing
economic
crisis
inflation
is
running
at
30
percent
and
falling
oil
prices
in
a
country
that
has
the
second
largest
known
oil
reserves
in
the
world
are
undermining
the
budget
analysts
said
the
vote
confirmed
the
division
between
conservative
forces
in
iranian
politics
ahead
of
the
presidential
vote
in
june
next
year
when
ahmadinejad
faces
reelection
out
of
247
present
at
the
vote
in
parliament
188
members
voted
to
dismiss
kordan
while
only
45
legislators
voted
against
his
dismissal
fourteen
members
abstained
the
dismissal
means
that
ahmadinejad
must
now
submit
his
whole
cabinet
to
a
vote
of
confidence
before
parliament
according
to
the
rules
of
the
countrys
constitution
if
10
cabinet
members
are
dismissed
all
members
must
face
a
confidence
vote
and
in
the
past
three
years
ahmadinejad
had
already
dismissed
nine
cabinet
members
because
they
disagreed
with
his
policies
no
president
has
faced
a
confidence
vote
on
the
entire
cabinet
members
of
parliament
had
questioned
the
qualifications
of
kordan
when
ahmadinejad
nominated
him
for
the
post
in
august
the
previous
minister
had
been
dismissed
because
of
his
differences
with
the
president
kordan
claimed
to
have
been
awarded
an
honorary
doctorate
from
oxford
university
but
a
parliamentary
investigation
found
not
only
that
kordans
phd
was
a
fake
but
also
that
he
had
neither
the
bachelors
nor
masters
degrees
from
an
iranian
university
he
had
claimed
the
scandal
over
his
impeachment
turned
into
a
crisis
on
wednesday
when
a
government
official
muhammad
abbassi
distributed
5000
checks
among
parliamentary
ministers
who
had
signed
the
impeachment
motion
the
weekly
news
magazine
shahrvand
emrooz
reported
that
abbassi
gave
the
checks
as
a
donation
for
the
legislators
local
mosques
but
asked
them
to
sign
two
receipts
one
of
those
receipts
was
for
a
letter
to
the
speaker
of
parliament
asking
for
the
impeachment
to
be
dropped
ali
asghar
zarei
a
legislator
close
to
ahmadinejad
slapped
abbassi
in
the
face
and
the
speaker
expelled
the
official
from
parliament
later
abbassi
was
dismissed
by
ahmadinejad
who
said
he
would
not
bother
to
appear
in
parliament
to
defend
his
minister
who
cares
even
if
mr
kordans
degree
is
fake
the
islamic
republic
news
agency
quoted
ahmadinejad
as
asking
i
have
already
said
that
it
is
just
a
torn
piece
of
paper
because
it
was
only
an
honorary
degree
ahmadinejad
had
said
he
did
not
consider
the
impeachment
legal
because
kordan
had
done
nothing
wrong
one
member
of
parliament
avaz
heidarpour
wrote
a
public
letter
to
the
president
saying
that
he
could
have
won
millions
of
votes
by
dismissing
kordan
and
that
his
support
of
the
minister
would
instead
cost
him
those
votes
the
daily
newspaper
etemad
reported
monday
the
powerful
post
of
speaker
of
parliament
is
held
by
a
rival
to
ahmadinejad
ali
larijani
a
conservative
and
an
ardent
advocate
of
irans
nuclear
program
he
was
also
close
to
kordan
but
was
also
seen
as
someone
who
is
more
pragmatic
than
ahmadinejad
in
his
approach
and
perhaps
willing
to
engage
in
diplomacy
with
the
west
the
swiss
banking
giant
ubs
reported
a
thirdquarter
net
profit
on
tuesday
but
warned
that
the
outlook
for
the
rest
of
the
year
was
gloomy
the
bank
which
is
struggling
to
restore
its
business
and
reputation
after
it
was
caught
up
in
the
collapse
of
the
mortgage
market
reported
a
net
profit
of
296
million
swiss
francs
252
million
compared
with
a
yearearlier
loss
of
858
million
francs
operating
income
fell
38
percent
to
56
billion
francs
the
bank
also
predicted
that
the
difficult
conditions
seen
in
october
would
continue
to
weigh
on
its
business
and
said
it
would
continue
to
cut
operating
expenses
where
possible
ubs
reputation
as
one
of
the
worlds
most
conservative
banks
was
left
in
tatters
after
its
bets
on
the
mortgage
securities
market
in
the
united
states
went
spectacularly
wrong
it
has
now
written
down
nearly
49
billion
since
the
start
of
the
credit
crisis
including
44
billion
in
the
latest
quarter
losses
and
writedowns
by
banks
worldwide
are
approaching
700
billion
since
the
start
of
last
year
the
results
were
in
line
with
expectations
as
the
bank
had
given
investors
an
update
on
oct
16
on
that
day
the
swiss
government
announced
a
deal
to
inject
6
billion
francs
into
ubs
a
move
that
will
give
it
a
9
percent
stake
in
the
bank
the
government
also
agreed
to
help
move
up
to
60
billion
of
illiquid
securities
and
other
assets
from
ubss
balance
sheet
to
a
separate
fund
ubs
said
the
deal
to
clean
up
its
balance
sheet
caps
future
potential
losses
from
these
assets
and
greatly
reduced
the
amount
of
risk
it
carried
the
bank
said
it
now
had
a
tier1
capital
ratio
a
measure
of
financial
strength
of
108
percent
in
line
with
its
european
peers
ubs
actually
posted
on
tuesday
an
operating
loss
of
480
million
francs
but
it
said
its
results
had
been
improved
by
a
gain
of
22
billion
francs
it
booked
on
its
own
debt
as
well
as
a
tax
credit
of
913
million
francs
it
noted
that
the
value
of
its
debt
has
risen
the
bailout
was
announced
so
it
could
end
up
having
to
book
a
loss
on
that
item
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
bank
said
clients
continued
to
desert
its
wealth
management
business
in
the
third
quarter
with
net
outflows
of
493
billion
francs
clients
of
its
global
asset
management
business
withdrew
a
net
344
billion
francs
but
it
said
there
had
been
some
improvement
in
the
businesses
since
the
government
bailout
was
announced
shares
of
ubs
have
fallen
about
60
percent
this
year
on
tuesday
they
fell
43
percent
in
early
zurich
trading
chinese
and
taiwanese
officials
signed
agreements
on
tuesday
expanding
charter
flights
maritime
shipping
and
cooperation
on
food
safety
issues
bringing
their
governments
closer
together
as
both
struggle
to
overcome
economic
slowdowns
the
agreements
were
finalized
on
the
second
day
of
a
planned
fiveday
visit
to
taiwan
by
a
mainland
delegation
led
by
chen
yunlin
the
head
of
the
association
for
relations
across
the
taiwan
strait
the
main
negotiating
body
for
china
in
matters
related
to
taiwan
chen
is
the
most
senior
chinese
communist
party
official
to
visit
taiwan
since
1949
when
the
kuomintang
lost
the
chinese
civil
war
and
occupied
taiwan
while
in
retreat
the
mainland
chinese
government
considers
taiwan
a
rebel
province
that
must
be
restored
to
china
many
taiwanese
prefer
to
maintain
the
status
quo
while
others
lobby
strongly
to
move
toward
formal
independence
taiwans
economic
growth
has
lagged
behind
chinas
in
recent
years
spurring
the
taiwanese
last
march
to
elect
ma
yingjeou
a
longtime
kuomintang
politician
as
president
ma
ran
on
a
platform
of
improving
the
economy
through
closer
ties
with
the
mainland
the
presidential
election
and
an
earlier
parliamentary
election
were
seen
as
referendums
on
the
policies
of
chen
shuibian
the
former
president
whose
family
members
are
accused
of
corruption
and
whose
party
the
democratic
progressive
party
leans
toward
taiwanese
independence
the
agreements
reached
on
tuesday
were
a
result
of
the
attempts
made
by
mas
government
at
engagement
with
the
mainland
in
june
just
after
he
was
inaugurated
ma
sent
a
delegation
to
beijing
to
sign
an
agreement
establishing
a
regular
weekend
schedule
of
charter
flights
between
china
and
taiwan
mas
popularity
has
plummeted
in
recent
months
partly
based
on
criticism
that
he
is
giving
away
too
much
to
china
but
he
pushed
forward
with
a
second
round
of
talks
the
new
transportation
agreement
raises
to
108
from
36
the
number
of
weekly
roundtrip
charter
flights
according
to
a
summary
of
the
agreement
posted
on
a
web
site
run
by
the
taiwanese
government
the
flights
are
expected
to
run
daily
with
21
cities
on
the
mainland
and
eight
in
taiwan
receiving
service
the
planes
will
also
fly
in
a
direct
line
between
cities
over
a
route
north
of
taiwan
charter
flights
between
china
and
taiwan
currently
take
a
longer
route
through
hong
kong
airspace
because
of
security
concerns
under
the
new
routing
direct
flights
between
taipei
and
beijing
will
take
two
hours
and
flights
between
taipei
and
shanghai
will
take
80
minutes
china
and
taiwan
will
add
direct
cargo
charter
flights
as
well
with
60
scheduled
per
month
the
two
governments
will
also
open
direct
shipping
channels
for
passengers
and
cargo
china
will
open
a
total
of
63
ports
48
seaports
and
15
riverports
and
taiwan
will
open
11
to
avoid
political
sensitivities
ships
will
not
fly
national
flags
the
two
governments
also
agreed
to
expand
free
exchange
of
information
regarding
food
safety
issues
if
any
product
is
considered
faulty
or
dangerous
a
government
will
recall
it
and
halt
its
shipment
according
to
the
agreement
discussion
of
the
issue
arose
because
mainland
china
has
been
grappling
with
its
biggest
food
safety
crisis
in
years
in
september
chinese
dairy
products
were
discovered
to
have
been
contaminated
with
melamine
a
toxic
chemical
used
in

that
has
been
regularly

added
to

died
and
53000

complications
resulting
from

suspect
chinese
foods
have
been
recalled
around
the
world
including
in
taiwan
china
and
taiwan
also
agreed
to
start
direct
mail
service
with
the
four
agreements
direct
transport
and
mail
services
that
compatriots
on
both
sides
have
been
longing
for
over
the
past
30
years
have
become
a
reality
and
will
provide
more
convenient
channels
for

on

the

together
and
held
up
large

containing
the
signatures
chens
arrival
on
monday
was
marked
by
a
handful
of
protests
democratic
progressive
party
supporters
have
loudly
denounced
chens
visit
and
one
of
his
mainland
colleagues
was
knocked
to
the
ground
by
a
taiwanese
politician
while
on
a
recent
visit
to
the
confucius
temple
in
the
southern
city
of
tainan
where
the
party
has
strong
support
the

that

the

off

receiver
greg
camarillo
put
in
a
few
minutes
work
conducting
a
news
conference
at
training
camp
where
the
first
question
was
when
was
the
last
time
he
conducted
a
news
conference
the
selfdeprecating
camarillo
flashed
a
youvegottobekiddingme
grin
while
taking
an
unfamiliar
place
behind
the
lectern
mindful
that
camarillo
has
43
receptions
someone
asked
if
this
is
his
best
season
in
football
to
which
camarillo
pretended
to
assess
matters
carefully
before
reminding
everyone
he
had
roughly
46
catches
at
stanford
in
his
career
so
yes
he
concluded
evoking
more
laughter
the
upbeat
mood
came
thanks
to
a
2617
victory
at
denver
on
sunday
that
left
miami
44
and
in
the
thick
of
playoff
contention
if
thats
a
stunning
statement
following
a
115
disaster
last
year
so
be
it
the
dolphins
had
trotted
out
the
perfect
player
to
personify
how
in
half
a
season
the
team
has
made
obsolete
so
many
expectations
it
might
have
had
in
preseason
camarillos
goal
in
july
to
make
the
team
he
said
monday
he
quickly
added
that
he
has
revised
that
goal
in
much
the
same
way
the
entire
team
has
under
firstyear
coach
tony
sparano
theres
nothing
to
compare
really
said
camarillo
who
provided
the
lone
highlight
last
year
by
scoring
the
overtime
touchdown
against
baltimore
that
averted
a
winless
season
its
a
completely
different
team
completely
different
mentally
you
can
kind
of
see
that
late
in
the
game
last
year
we
would
have
found
a
way
to
lose
the
game
as
opposed
to
this
year
we
find
a
way
to
win
games
thats
what
good
teams
do
a
turning
point
camarillo
said
might
have
occurred
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
when
sparano
asked
some
players
to
address
the
group
including
tight
end
anthony
fasano
who
used
a
word
that
until
then
seemed
taboo
he
said
why
dont
we
talk
about
the
playoffs
its
something
thats
not
spoken
about
guys
have
it
as
a
goal
but
we
dont
really
talk
about
it
much
in
the
locker
room
they
do
now
we
need
to
expect
it
camarillo
said
we
need
to
reach
for
it
which
is
exactly
what
sparano
wants
to
hear
rather
than
having
to
prop
up
players
psyches
after
moral
victories
that
are
reallife
losses
as
was
the
case
last
year
for
coach
cam
cameron
sparano
finds
himself
in
a
critics
role
pointing
out
shortcomings
this
week
he
found
that
job
pretty
tough
were
supposed
to
look
at
these
wins
and
talk
about
how
we
can
do
better
sparano
said
on
the
defensive
side
of
the
ball
i
thought
that
yesterday
it
was
hard
to
find
some
things
that
werent
really
good
although
the
offense
sputtered
at
times
it
produced
a
15play
80yard
touchdown
drive
in
crunch
time
much
like
camarillo
recorded
one
of
the
most
productive
receiving
days
in
dolphins
history
a
man
who
originally
wanted
to
just
protect
his
job
finds
himself
no
11
in
the
nfl
in
number
of
receptions

ahead
of
randy
moss
lee
evans
and
terrell
owens

and
no
28
in
receiving
yards
with
483

just
behind
wes
welker
but
ahead
of
braylon
edwards
plaxico
burress
and
yes
terrell
owens
sparano
said
the
time
for
him
to
learn
what
camarillo
can
do
is
past
i
have
a
pretty
clear
understanding
of
what
camarillo
is
all
about
sparano
said
hes
a
hard
guy
not
to
like
equally
important
the
coaches
have
an
understanding
of
the
receivers
as
a
whole
ted
ginn
had
175
yards
in
receptions
a
week
ago
against
buffalo
but
with
denver
rotating
a
safety
to
doublecover
ginn
the
dolphins
had
no
problem
leaning
on
camarillo
no
disrespect
to
any
of
my
players

i
love
them
all

but
theres
no
star
in
that
group
sparano
said
they
all
know
that
they
have
a
role
and
from
day
1
weve
said
that
were
trying
to
define
those
roles
i
think
weve
done
that
imperfections
of
course
remain
sparano
said
the
runblocking
was
often
ineffective
sunday
the
team
settled
for
field
goals
when
it
could
have
scored
touchdowns
and
thirdandlong
situations
remain
troublesome
but
if
anything
symbolizes
an
evolving
attitude
it
might
be
a
bruise
one
of
the
dolphins
placed
on
sparano
in
the
mayhem
of
a
successful
fourthdown
conversion
on
the
decisive
drive
i
did
get
a

of
slaps

smacks

dear
dr
lecrone
my
sister
regularly
practices
amateur
psychology
on
her
friends
and
family
and
she
claims
that
i
am
overusing
my
defense
mechanisms
im
not
about
to
give
her
the
satisfaction
of
asking
her
what
she
means
can
you
please
tell
me
what
she
may
be
accusing
me
of
or
is
she
just
making
up
psychobabble

a
reader
in
new
york
dear
reader
obviously
i
cant
be
sure
without
asking
her
but
my
best
guess
follows
defense
mechanisms
are
strategies
or
manners
in
which
we
behave
or
think
to
protect
or
defend
ourselves
from
painful
thoughts
or
feelings
we
all
use
them
periodically
in
an
attempt
to
deal
with
the
world
around
us
utilizing
these
defenses
appropriately
can
be
useful
and
helpful
however
all
too
often
their
usefulness
is
extended
beyond
the
boundaries
of
good
mental
health
lets
look
at
three
of
these
defense
mechanisms
in
their
more
unhealthy
forms
rationalization
is
a
defense
mechanism
that
involves
explaining
an
unacceptable
behavior
or
feeling
in
a
rational
or
logical
manner
that
avoids
the
true
explanation
for
the
behavior
making
excuses
to
justify
behavior
includes
such
examples
as
my
children
behave
the
way
they
do
because
this
is
the
standard
that
society
now
promotes
and
accepts
i
dont
exercise
because
doing
so
is
not
possible
with
my
busy
schedule
and
i
am
always
so
sore
the
next
day
i
cant
get
out
of
bed
and
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
another
person
because
i
never
really
loved
my
husband

denial
is
a
commonly
used
defense
mechanism
that
can
lead
to
real
problems
these
include
avoiding
the
truth
acknowledging
only
part
of
a
bigger
situation
or
leaving
out
important
information
examples
are
just
because
i
am
overdrawn
at
the
bank
and
over
my
credit
limit
on
credit
cards
doesnt
mean
i
cant
manage
my
money
and
i
havent
been
depressed
all
of
these
years

my
moods
are
simply
a
reflection
of
my
situation
intellectualization
is
used
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
reality
and
psychological
pain
by
taking
a
very
abstract
view
of
the
situation
my
problems
are
so
complex
that
only
einsteins
theory
of
relativity
can
explain
them
or
i
deal
with
my
problems
by
studying
the
lives
of
successful
individuals
and
how
they
deal
with
their
problems
i
hope
this
discussion
helps
you
if
readers
find
this
information
useful
please
tell
me

i
will

other
defense
mechanisms

a
spokesman
for
the

police
in

central
region
said
that
the
bag
was
found
after
iraqi
customs
police
received
intelligence
reports
that
terrorists
were
trying
to
enter
iraq
from
saudi
arabia
on
sunday
night
customs
police
were
conducting
patrols
in
an
area
called
rahba
near
iraqs
border
with
saudi
arabia
mr
jaberi
said
in
a
phone
interview
they
saw
a
pickup
truck
heading
toward
iraqi
territory
when
the
police
noticed
the
truck
it
departed
leaving
a
bag
it
was
a
large
duffel
bag
with
a
long
zipper
jaberi
said
and
it
turned
out
to
be
full
of
highly
explosive
material
it
was
unclear
whether
the
men
in
the
pickup
intended
to
actually
enter
iraq
or
whether
they
were
simply
waiting
for
someone
to
come
so
that
they
could
hand
the
bag
off
to
him
the
american
military
did
not
comment
and
it
was
not
possible
to
independently
verify
the
findings
of
the
najaf
customs
police
the
indonesian
police
have
stepped
up
security
ahead
of
the
expected
executions
this
week
of
three
islamic
militants
convicted
in
the
2002
bali
bombings
on
tuesday
the
police
were
investigating
bomb
threats
made
against
the
american
and
australian
embassies
the
threats
sent
to
the
police
by
text
message
warned
that
the
embassies
would
be
attacked
if
the
executions
were
carried
out
a
police
spokesman
said
both
embassies
remained
open
fearing
retaliatory
attacks
security

major

authorities
on
the
resort

of

were
checking
all
vehicles
at
every
point
of
entry
outside
the
prison
in
west
java
where
the
three
men
are
being
held
the

have
erected

barricades
no

for
the
three
has
been
allowed
to
travel
to
the
prison
in
recent
days
which
is
set
on
a
small
offshore
island
the
situation
so
far
is
stable
said
sulistiyo
ishak
a
spokesman
for
the
national
police
but
there
is
definitely
the
possibility
that
the
executions
could
lead
certain
groups
to
try
and
take
revenge
what
we
are
doing
is
to
be
much
more
aware
of
our
surroundings
and
to
try
and
anticipate
anything
that
could
be
a
threat
the
three
men
iman
samudra
ali
ghufron
and
his
younger
brother
amrozi
have
exhausted
their
appeals
the
attorney
general
has
said
the
executions
by
firing
squad
would
likely
take
place
early
this
month
the
men
members
of
jemaah
islamiyah
a
regional
terror
network
associated
with
alqaida
were
convicted
of
building
transporting
and
placing
the

that
killed
202
people
mostly
foreign
tourists
in
signed
statements
dated

and
published
on
an
islamist
web
site
under
the
headline
not
one
drop
of

muslims
blood
comes
for

the
men
called
on
muslims
to
pick
up
the
sword
and
continue
to
fight
for
islam
lawyers
for
the
three
men
filed
lastminute
appeals
to
delay
the
executions
but
were
quickly
rebuffed
by
the
indonesian
courts
which
said
they
had
no
more
legal
options
and
that
the
executions
would
proceed
the
lawyers
however
said
previous
appeals
were
never
seriously
considered
and
complained
that
the
authorities
had
made
it
difficult
for
them
to
meet
with
their
clients
we
dont
believe
their
case
has
been
properly
tried
said
achmad
michdan
one
of
the
lawyers
we
believe
all
proper
legal
procedures
should
be
followed
before

takes
place
one

last

on

a

said
the

said
that
bin

was
traveling
on
a
saudi
passport
and
was
being
held
at
the
airport
in
a
special
center
for

seekers
under

law
the
government
has
72
hours
to
decide
whether
to
allow
him
to
stay
she
said
if
he
is
granted
provisional
asylum
bin

may
remain
in

while
his

is
reviewed
if
his
petition
is
denied
he
has
one

to

not
immediately
clear

met
bin

in

last

and
married
him
in

according
to
news
reports
at
the
time
bin
laden
was
refused
a
visa
by
the
british
embassy
in
cairo
in
april
because
of
what
the
authorities
perceived
to
be
his
loyalty
to
his
father
which
would
cause
considerable
public
concern
in
britain
according
to
the
associated
press
he
was
said
in
those
reports
to
have
gone
into

with

hey
the
tvs
not
working
just
100
days
from
sunday
tv
viewers
in
millions
of
us
households
may
be
startled
to
discover
that
most
television
stations
have
turned
off
their
analog
broadcast
signals
leaving
older
tv
sets
blank
unless
theyre
tethered
to
cable
satellite
dishes
or
digital
converter
boxes
broadcasters
and
government
officials
are
trying
to
warn
americans
about
the
dawning
of
the
digital
tv
age
on
feb
17
but
critics
say
those
efforts
may
be
inadequate
for
many
of
the
134
million
households
without
pay
tv
it
would
appear
there
will
be
a
lot
of
people
whose
tv
sets
will
go
blank
said
mark
cooper
research
director
of
the
consumer
federation
of
america
other
confused
viewers
may
end
up
spending
far
more
money
than
necessary
to
cope
with
analog
tv
tuners
that
no
longer
can
receive
broadcast
signals
unfortunately
a
lot
of
people
will
spend
more
money
than
they
actually
need
to
because
cable
advertising
is
pushing
them
to
get
600ayear
cable
service
when
people
could
solve
the
problem
with
a
50
box
cooper
said
supporters
of
the
digital
age
say
that
all
tv
viewers
will
start
getting
better
pictures
and
sound
as
well
as
more
programming
choices
moreover
by
abandoning
analog
signals
broadcasters
will
create
more
radio
spectrum
to
be
used
for
public
safety
communications
and
advanced
wireless
services
cooper
said
the
government
has
made
the
right
decision
because
emergency
responders
really
do
need
more
communications
capabilities
it
was
time
to
move
on
he
said
now
the
government
is
working
hard
to
get
the
word
out
to
the
estimated
12
percent
of
households
whose
only
access
to
tv
is
via
a
home
antenna
and
whose
older
sets
arent
equipped
with
a
digital
tuner
to
handle
the
new
signals
for
those
viewers
the
choice
is
to
subscribe
to
a
pay
tv
service
buy
a
new
set
or
buy
a
converter
box
to
make
their
present
set
digitalready
the
federal
government
is
providing
40
coupons
to
reduce
the
cost
of
the
converter
boxes
the
coupons
typically
push
down
the
price
of
a
box
to
about
20
or
even
less
at
major
chains
such
as
walmart
sears
and
best
buy
at
a
senate
commerce
committee
hearing
into
the
dtv
transition
in
september
federal
communications
commission
chairman
kevin
martin
said
the
people
most
in
need
of
help
are
senior
citizens
nonenglish
speakers
and
minorities
people
with
disabilities
lowincome
consumers
and
those
living
in
rural
or
tribal
areas
committee
chairman
daniel
inouye
dhawaii
urged
the
fcc
and
the
national
telecommunications
and
information
administration
ntia
to
work
harder
to
make
sure
the
new
white
house
and
congress
do
not
immediately
face
a
communications
crisis
we
have
too
many
crises
facing
us
at
the
moment
martin
said
fcc
officials
are
now
better
prepared
because
of
a
test
run
they
began
sept
8
in
wilmington
nc
local
broadcasters
there
turned
off
their
analog
signals
and
now
send
only
digital
signals
to
the
areas
400000
viewers
the
test
generally
has
been
viewed
as
a
success
retailers
had
enough
converter
boxes
on
hand
and
local
broadcasters
tried
hard
to
educate
viewers
still
officials
found
that
many
older
people
needed
help
hooking
up
their
converter
boxes
adjusting
their
antennas
or
scanning
channels
and
some
viewers
could
not
afford
the
boxes
even
with
the
subsidy
coupons
to
reach
the
poor
and
elderly
before
their
tvs
go
blank
on
feb
17
government
needs
the
commitment
of
the
local
community
including
local
industry
governmental
and
nongovernmental
organizations
martin
said
for
months
ntia
has
been
mailing
out
converterbox
coupons
still
consumer
groups
fear
ntia
could
be
swamped
by
a
surge
in
coupon
requests
as
the
conversion
approaches
even
after
every
viewer
has
cable
a
converter
or
a
new
tv
there
still
will
be
problems
many
people
may
find
they
have
fallen
off
the
socalled
digital
cliff
people
who
receive
a
weak
analog
signal
still
can
view
programming
even
if
its
less
than
perfectly
clear
but
with
digital
tuners
when
a
signal
gets
too
weak
it
drops
off
a
cliff
and
disappears
entirely
according
to
the
dtv
transition
coalition
if
your
tv
was
built
before
1998
you
can
assume
it
lacks
a
builtin
digital
tuner
if
it
was
built
after
2004
it
likely
does
have
a
digital
tuner
though
thats
not
a
sure
thing
the
coalition
says
the
best
way
to
determine
whether
your
tv
set
has
a
builtin
digital
tuner
is
to
check
the
owners
manual
or
the
manufacturers
web
site
the
coalition
also
says
owners
can
look
for
an
input
connection
labeled
digital
input
or
atsc
for
advanced
television
systems
committee
which
developed
the
dtv
format
dont
feel
reassured
just
because
you
own
a
newer
set
that
was
advertised
as
hdready
or
hdtv
monitor
such
sets
may
lack
the
internal
tuner
needed
to
receive
digital
broadcasts
even
though
they
can
display
digital
and
highdefinition
signals
once
a
converter
box
or
cable
connection
has
converted
the
signals
from
analog
getting
ready
for
digital
broadcasts
owners
of
analog
tv
sets
have
three
ways
to
go
after
feb
17

keep
the
old
tv
set
and
hook
it
to
a
converter
box

subscribe
to
cable
satellite
or
another
pay
service

buy
a
modern
television
with
a
builtin
digital
tuner
to
help
pay
for
the
converter
box
the
government
is
providing
each
household
with
up
to
two

britt
barkley
and
his

suzanne
have
a
deal
if

vacuums
the
downstairs
she
vacuums
the
upstairs
in
their
nearly
4000squarefoot
home
she
mows
and
he
edges
a
major
job
given
their
huge
treedotted
yard
she
cooks
and
he
cleans
up
after
dinner
he
does
the
laundry
she
helps
put
it
away
i
actually
have
girlfriends
who
are
jealous
because
he
helps
me
so
much
says
suzanne
whose
tanned
legs
and
arms
attest
to
her
love
of
yard
work
granted
britt
might
be
doing
a
tad
more
now
that
hes
retired
and
around
the
house
after
26
years
in
military
service
but
hes
always
been
willing
to
share
the
load
in
their
sixyear
relationship
says
suzanne
who
works
out
of
the
house
reselling
computer
systems
you
might
think
couples
like
the
barkleys
are
an
anomaly

statistics
show
american
wives
do
the
majority
of
the
work
when
it
comes
to
housecleaning
child
care
and
related
chores
but
the
tectonic
plates
that
undergird
the
american
home
front
are
shifting
more
and
more
men
are
entering
the
domestic
domain
experts
say
the
resulting
egalitarianstyle
marriages
point
to
a
new
way
of
life
where
dusting
burping
and
sauteing
will
no
longer
be
considered
mainly
xchromosome
endeavors
britt
a
squarejawed
retired
air
force
officer
with
a
buzz
cut
credits
his
enlightened
attitude
to
a
hardscrabble
upbringing
in
which
all
his
siblings
were
expected
to
carry
their
weight
his
mother
worked
during
the
day
and
his
father
a
musician
worked
at
night
so
i
grew
up
seeing
a
male
figure
sweeping
and
cleaning
and
cooking
says
britt
who
like
his
wife
is
in
his
mid40s
he
did
the
breakfast
he
did
the
lunch
and
the
military
engrains
in
you
from
day
one
that
you
will
take
care
of
everything
fold
your
own
clothes
and
more
he
adds
during
the
years
after
his
unhappy
first
marriage

that
wife
didnt
help
around
the
house
at
all

britt
lived
alone
and
maintained
his
own
household
so
when
he
and
suzanne
got
hitched
both
were
used
to
fulfilling
their
own
domestic
duties
to
be
sure
unions
in
which
the
menfolk
lend
a
hand
in
the
kitchen
and
laundry
room
have
been
around
forever
but
studies
show
the
divide
that
separates
who
does
what
around
the
house
genderwise
is
slowly
coming
down
increasingly
you
can
find
couples
such
as
eric
and
tracy
wernli
whose
tagteam
approach
to
parenting
means
the
job
of
nurturing
their
5yearold
son
blake
gets
spread
around
evenly
i
get
blake
up
in
the
morning
get
him
dressed
and
fed
says
eric
36
a
middle
school
assistant
principal
tracy
brushes
his
hair
and
teeth
and
takes
him
to
school
i
usually
cook
and
she
cleans
the
dishes
laundry
we
share
its
always
been
this
way
my
wife
has
a
job
just
like
me
so
theres
no
reason
she
should
be
pulling
more
of
the
load
its
only
fair
that
i
help
out
tracy
38
a
school
district
special
education
coordinator
says
alternating
who
gives
blake
a
bath
and
reads
him
a
bedtime
story
means
she
and
her
spouse
of
eight
years
each
get
to
spend
quality
time
with
their
son
and
it
relays
to
blake
that
parenting
is
an
equalopportunity
affair
we
didnt
want
blake
to
think
nurturing
was
just
mommys
job
tracy
says
she
and
eric
sat
down
early
in
their
marriage
and
hashed
out
their
current
equitable
arrangement
we
did
a
lot
of
talking
tracy
says
im
a
very
neat
organized
and
structured
person
and
eric
is
a
little
more
lackadaisical
i
told
him
we
needed
to
come
up
with
something
so
that
im
not
bitching
so
much
and
he
really
followed
through
hes
amazing
its
not
always
perfect
but
we
really
work
at
making
things
even
stephanie
coontz
of
the
council
on
contemporary
families
points
to
a
number
of
surveys
that
reflect
the
shifts
in
the
american
landscape
from
1997
to
2003
the
gender
gap
in
hours
devoted
to
housework
fell
by
more
than
70
percent
she
says
the
90s
saw
big
increases
in

this
was

true

in

worked

the
increase
in
mens
domestic
involvement
has
spilled
over
into

weve
seen
real
changes
says
coontz
who
largely
attributes
the
rise
in
men
helping
out
to
the
influx
of
women
into
the
work
force
weve
all
had
to
sit
down

think
through
these
kinds
of
issues
in
a
way
no
previous
generation
bothered
to
do
are
egalitarian

truly

and
author
of

all
how
equally
shared
parenting
works
says
gauging
marital
happiness
is
tricky
most
people
are
loathe
to
report
theyre
unhappy
but
when
she
asked
wives
how
often
they
become
angry
women
in
traditional
marriages
report
a
significantly
higher
level
of
anger
but
the
most
unhappy
people
in
the
entire
sample
were
the
women
who
were
working
fulltime
and
doing
75
percent
of
the
work
at
home
she
says
their
husbands
were
unhappy
too
she
adds
so
much
for
superwoman
wayne
brown
at

would
seem
to
come
from
a
generation
immersed
in
traditional
gender
roles
but
he
carries
his
weight
around
the
house
so
his
wife
debbie
49
can
work
at
a
tennis
ranch
and
go
to
community
college
to
become
an
ultrasound
technician
he
works
out
of
his
home
shop
rebuilding
police
swat
vehicles
and
takes
time
to
vacuum
sweep
mop
and
do
the
laundry
its
a
mistake
that
a
wife
should
have
to
do
everything
he
says
why
should
the
guy
sit
on
his
butt
people
like
to
read
numbers
in
the

true
sports
fans
for
example
gobble
up

other
statistics
that
we
refer
to

named

just

high
though
why
its
named
after
a
volcanic

i
cant
say
so
lets
take
a
look
at
some
of
the
numbers
swirling
about
our
newsroom
last
week

statistics
that
reveal
the
depth
of
the
economic
meltdown
the
course
of
the
presidential
race
and
the
performance
of
our
own
industry
theyre
revealing

72
percentage
of
albanyarea
residents
who
read
the
times
union
newspaper
or
our
web
site
every
month
according
to
new
data
from
scarborough
research
that
puts
us
in
the
top
10
newspapers
nationally
for
readership
growth
ah
you
say
but
i
read
that
newspapers
daily
circulation
is
dropping
well
yes
people
dont
interact
with
news
sources
the
way
they
used
to
theyre
not
watching
the
evening
newscasts
listening
to
radio
reports
or
picking
up
the
paper
every
day
but
more
people
are
checking
our
web
site
several
times
a
day
that
helps
account
for
the
varying
numbers
around
the
country
in
fact
publishers
are
intentionally
trimming
that
daily
circulation
number
by
focusing
on
their
core
markets
rather
than
outlying
areas
and
on
the
days
of
the
week
when
people
read
more
whats
dropping
is
known
as
vanity
circulation
and
in
its
place
is
an
effort
to
get
papers
into
the
hands
of
real
news
consumers
the
demographic
our
advertisers
most
want
to
reach
too

025
and
111
percentage
of
increase
in
times
union
circulation
over
the
last
six
months
on
sunday
and
saturday
respectively
according
to
data
released
by
the
audit
bureau
of
circulation
that
underscores
the
migration
to
lateintheweek
readership
its
the
fifth
straight
halfyear
reporting
period
in
which
this
newspaper
has
reported
growing
circulation

a
streak
matched
by
only
one
other
newspaper
in
the
country
dont
tell
me
theres
not
a
great
future
for
print
journalism
in
this
market

121
billion
56
billion
the
first
number
is
the
total
new
york
state
budget
the
second
is
what
gov
david
paterson
says
the
state
actually
has
to
spend
once
you
pull
out
direct
aid
to
localities
and
spending
mandated
by
the
federal
government
in
an
editorial
board
meeting
here
paterson
discussed
projections
that
the
state
will
run
15
billion
short
of
revenue
in
the
current
fiscal
year
and
face
a
deficit
of
125
billion
in
the
fiscal
year
that
begins
next
april
1
in
weighing
the
depth
of
the
state
fiscal
crisis
created
by
the
economic
meltdown
then
the
14
billion
in
cuts
confronting
paterson
and
legislators
needs
to
be
compared
against
not
the
total
state
budget
but
the
smaller
figure
our
lawmakers
actually
can
control
so
paterson
wants
washington
to
come
up
with
a
second
stimulus
package
this
one
aimed
at
hardhit
states

869
billion
thats
how
much
less
money
new
york
got
from
the
federal
government
last
year
than
we
sent
to
washington
in
taxes
no
wonder
paterson
says
more
of
it
should
be
sent
back
now
the
financial
crisis
has
hit
the
state
that
is
home
to
wall
street
harder
than
anywhere
else
the
three
states
that
get
the
biggest
payback
from
the
feds
south
carolina
whose
governor
unsurprisingly
opposes
federal
aid
to
troubled
states
arizona
and
alaska
look
at
that
list
and
figure
which
of
the
national
tickets
is
less
likely
to
side
with
paterson
in
this
debate

roughly
0

just
when
you
thought
it
was
fine
to
relax
with
a
glass
of
wellearned
wine
and
nibble
on
a
few
wholegrain
crackers
nutrition
researchers
are
here
to
ask
did
you
have
enough
protein
today
ok
we
know
youre
not
into
bodybuilding
competitions
but
get
a
load
of
this
midlife
reality
check
you
could
be
losing
muscle
mass
and
strength

a
condition
called
sarcopenia

if
you
dont
consume
enough
highquality
protein
on
a
daily
basis
were
seeing
sarcopenia
which
commonly
occurs
in
the
elderly
in
younger
subjects
in
their
early
to
mid50s
said
susan
hewlings
a
registered
dietitian
and
assistant
professor
at
stetson
university
in
florida
who
specializes
in
protein
metabolism
hewlings
and
other
researchers
presenting
at
the
2008
american
dietetic
associations
annual
food
and
nutrition
conference
shed
new
light
on
the
connection
between
what
we
eat
and
the
health
of
our
aging
muscles
bottom
line
research
shows
that
to
prevent
and
treat
lost
muscle
mass
you
must
consume
15
grams
of
protein
for
every
kilogram
of
body
weight
per
day
that
translates
to
about
90
grams
of
protein
a
day
for
a
normal
weight
man
and
would
be
less
if
youre
a
tiny
gal
breakfast
lunch
dinner
but
heres
where
the
real
specific
advice
kicks
in
you
should
be
including
sources
of
highquality
protein
such
as
eggs
milk
and
meats
and
balancing
your
protein
intake
throughout
the
day
typically
people
eat
less
protein
at
breakfast
a
little
more
at
lunch
and
then
eat
a
lot
at
dinner
hewlings
said
to
optimize
protein
synthesis
and
prevent
sarcopenia
it
needs
to
be
more
evenly
distributed
there
goes
that
diet
plan
to
starve
all
day
and
splurge
on
a
big
steak
for
dinner
your
muscles
are
hungry
for
amino
acids
found
in
protein
foods
all
day
long
in
fact
robert
wolfe
professor
of
geriatrics
at
the
university
of
arkansas
for
medical
sciences
in
little
rock
warns
that
when
there
are
periods
of
the
day
when
no
amino
acids
are
being
absorbed
from
the
gut
muscle
serves
as
the
only
significant
reservoir
of
protein
that
means
your
body
starts
robbing
the
muscles
of
stored
protein
to
keep
organs
and
other
tissues
humming
along
so
make
sure
youre
eating
proteincontaining
foods
every
day
and
including
protein
in
each
meal
and
that
includes
snacks
something
as
simple
as
fresh
apple
slices
topped
with
peanut
butter
is
a
good
choice
hewlings
emphasized
that
protein
alone
cant
do
the
job
of
preserving
and
building
muscles
as
we
age
i
call
exercise
the
poor
mans
plastic
surgery
she
said
and
note
that
physical
activity
boosts
lean
body
mass
only
if
youve
got
enough
protein
in
your
diet
keep
fat
intake
down
since
foods
are
often
a
combination
of
the
three
macronutrients
protein
carbohydrates
and
fat
choose
proteincontaining
foods
wisely
with
other
health
concerns
in
mind
for
instance
a
6ounce
broiled
porterhouse
steak
is
a
great
source
of
complete
protein

38
grams

but
contains
44
grams
of
fat
the
same
amount
of
salmon
gives
you
34
grams
of
protein
and
18
grams
of
fat
and
its
the
kind
of
fat
thats
good
for
you

beverly

they
were

but
absolutely
beautiful
things
black
suede
foldover
shoe
boots
with
stiletto
heels
they
were
fun
they
were
fashionable
and
they
were
on
sale
plus
i
had
a
coupon
they
were
not
what
i
needed
not
what
i
was
looking
for
and
not
anything
i
could
actually
walk
in
but
i
loved
them
and
when
the
salesman
asked
if
i
would
like
to
try
them
on
i
said
yes
i
stood
i
posed
i
strutted
in
front
of
a
mirror
they
were
the
most
frivolous
shoes
ever
they
were
exactly
what
not
to
wear
in
the
inclement
northeast
they
were
too
high
and
an
accident
waiting
to
happen
yet
they
were
exactly
what
i
wanted
what
is
it
about

anyway

my
grandmother
kay
was
in
her
70s
and
still
couldnt
pass
a
display
of
high
heels
without
swooning
and
sitting
down
to
try
on
a
pair
her
closet
was
full
of
leopard
and
patent
leather
she
couldnt
walk
in
she
sat
in
them
though
she
put
them
on
to
read
a
book
or
a
magazine
she
put
her
feet
high
on
a
hassock
looked
up
over
her
glasses
now
and
then
and
smiled
she
said
fancy
shoes
made
her
feel
fancy
i
am
not
like
my
grandmother
i
dont
buy
shoes
just
to
sit
in
but
i
dont
buy
them
to
walk
in
either
i
buy
them
when
i
need
them

purple
maryjane

with

all

ok
bargains
i
never
wore
because
the
boots
were
too
big
the
slippers
too
small
and
though
the
sandals
were
just
right
who
wears
bright
purple
but
i
made
these
bad
decisions
a
long
time
ago
i
was
young
i
was
immature
i
am
mature
now
so
last
week
i
went
in
search
of
practical
shoes
shoes
for
traipsing
through
airports
shoes
for
ice
and
snow
shoes
i
wouldnt
kick
off
in
movie
theaters
and
dark
restaurants
shoes
that
didnt
pinch
or
squeeze
or
send
stabbing
pains
through
my
sole
and
i
found
them
right
away
in
assorted
colors
in
a
mall
specialty
store
dozens
of
shoes
with
arch
supports
and
stretchable
leather
and
adjustable
straps
and
thick
walkingfriendly
heels
they
were
everything
i
needed
comfortable
practical
and
durable
but
they
were
not
pretty
they
were
not
pretty
at
all
i
suppose
its
possible
to
plunk
down
hard
cash
for
a
pair
of
ugly
shoes
my
mother
did
for
years
she
paid
for
corrective
shoes
for
me
but
the
second
i
was
the
one
buying
my
shoes
it
was
all
about
looks
forget
how
they
feel
but
i
had
seen
the
light
and
i
was
through
with
that
mindset
i
chose
black
leather
pumps
with
a
roomy
toe
and
comfortable
heel
they
fit
they
were
cushioned
i
could
walk
in
them
but
i
put
them
down
and
walked
away
down
the
escalator
back
to
the
incredibly
impractical
but
absolutely
beautiful
black
suede
boots
with
stiletto
heels
in
the
end
i
didnt
buy
them
either
i
just
drooled
over
them
a
little
longer
i
bought
black
clogs
that
arent
heels
but
have
a
little
height
and
are
so
comfortable
i
forget
to
take
them
off
my
grandmother
wouldnt
wear
them
but
i
can
walk
in
them
and
really
isnt
that

shoes
are

of

one
in
which

houses
mattered
more
than
magnoliascented

finally
eggleston
brought
a
loving
unemphatic
attention
to
bear
on
seemingly
banal
objects

a
childs
tricycle
being
the
most
famous
example

and
showed
how
visually
memorable
the
unheroic
could
be
although
eggleston
has
taken
his
bestknown
work
in

around

the

michael
jenkins
wasnt
a
fun
matchup
for
deangelo
hall
on
sunday
in
oakland
for
a
lot
of
reasons
not
only
did
jenkins
beat
his
old
falcons
teammate
and
friend
for
a
37yard
touchdown
in
a
240
rout
he
wasnt
one
to
bite
on
much
jibberjabber
either
jenkins
said
their
only
real
exchange
came
on
their
first
play
from
scrimmage
together
after
the
touchdown
when
hall
gave
him
a
ok
you
got
one
i
just
smiled
jenkins
said
jenkins
plays
it
pretty
straight
especially
for
an
nfl
wide
receiver

no
muss
or
fuss
at
times
that
means
he
can
blend
into
his
surroundings
a
little
including
the
shadow
of
emerging
star
receiver
roddy
white
but
time
after
time
this
season
jenkins
has
stepped
out
into
the
spotlight
with
big
plays

from
matt
ryans
first
pass
as
an
nfl
quarterback
which
jenkins
turned
into
a
62yard
touchdown
against
detroit
to
his
lastsecond
catch
to
set
up
the
gamewinning
field
goal
against
chicago
jenkins
was
back
at
it
sunday
with
the
second
twotouchdown
game
of
his
career
and
first
since
sept
30
of
last
year
against
houston
he
also
caught
a
27yarder
from
ryan
on
a
corner
route
i
think
michael
has
done
a
nice
job
when
he
has
had
opportunities
for
balls
to
come
his
way
falcons
coach
mike
smith
said
the
defense
dictates
that
if
matt
throws
it
in
his
direction
hes
made
the
play
the
majority
of
the
time
hes
made
some
real
big
plays
falcons
wide
receivers
coach
terry
robiskie
had
his
own
theory
about
jenkins
day
sunday
in
which
both
of
his
catches
went
for
touchdowns
i
think
that
had
a
little
bit
of
a
buddy
a
friendfriend
rival
to
it
robiskie
said
he
got
fired
up
matched
up
against
his
buddy
i
guess
he
figured
he
had
to
outdo
him
that
was
part
of
the
fun
jenkins
concedes
and
hes
just
continuing
to
develop
in
this
offense
trying
to
take
advantage
of
the
attention
going
whites
way
white
is
leading
the
falcons
with
48
catches
733
yards
and
five
touchdowns
receiving
jenkins
is
second
in
receiving
yards
323
and
touchdowns
three
hes
third
in
receptions
18
behind
jerious
norwood
jenkins
179
yards
per
catch
leads
the
falcons
white
is
fourth
in
the
nfl
with
those
733
receiving
yards
thats
the
big
thing
about
roddy
having
the
year
hes
having
robiskie
said
now
all
of
a
sudden
we
can
get
in
a
situation
where
theyve
got
to
double
roddy
theyve
got
to
put
their
best
guy
on
roddy
if
mike
ends
up
with
the
lesser
guy
the
third
corner
hes
got
to
win
thats
his
role
thats
what
we
expect
of
him
as
it
turns
out
robiskie
has
quite
a
few
expectations
of
jenkins
and
hes
not
afraid
to
share
them
i
wont
tell
you
anything
that
i
havent
told
him
but
every
day
of
our
lives
with
him
weve
got
to
keep
working
on
being
physical
physical
and
physical
robiskie
said
being
able
to
fight
and
beat
and
get
after
the
other
guys
like
i
tell
him
hes
too
much
of
a
pretty
boy
mikes
too
busy
right
now
trying
to
be
a
model
i
think
thats
what
his
goal
in
life
is
to
catch
a
couple
touchdowns
and
then
put
his
face
up
on
the
billboard
i
think
hes
hoping
some
modeling
agency
picks
up
on
that
a
little
harsh
maybe
but
it
sounds
like
robiskie
doesnt
treat
jenkins
any
differently
than
he
would

and
does

his
own
son
robiskies
son
brian
is
a
star
receiver
at
ohio
state
where
jenkins
started
for
three
years
he
gets
plenty
of
teasing
too
i
tell
mike
and
my
son
theyre
like
twins
them
pretty
boys
from
ohio
state
robiskie
said
they
got
to
get
their
hair
cut
and
put
some
lotion
on
before
the
game
jenkins
laughed
when
told
about
that
last
comment
hed
heard
it
before
he
knows
robiskie
wants
him
to
be
physical
at
the
line
of
scrimmage
and
in
the
run
game
and
jenkins
seems
comfortable
in
a
role
as
a
receiver
in
a
rundominated
attack
were
going
to
run
the
football
jenkins
said
when
we
do
that
it
opens
up
the
passing
game
downfield
its
making
the
most
of
every
ball
that
comes
your
way
bring
in

catch

dockworker
marcy
ingall
saw
a
giant
wave
in
the
distance
last
tuesday
1028
afternoon
and
stopped
in
her
tracks
it
was
an
hour
before
low
tide
in
maines
boothbay
harbor
yet
without
warning
the
muddy
harbor
floor
suddenly
filled
with
rushing
swirling
water
in
15
minutes
the
water
rose
12
feet
then
receded
and
then
it
happened
again
it
occurred
three
times
she
said
each
time
ripping
apart
docks
and
splitting
wooden
pilings
it
was
bizarre
said
ingall
a
lifelong
resident
of
the
area
everybody
was
like
oh
my
god
is
this
the
end
it
was
not
the
apocalypse
but
it
was
a
rare
phenomenon
one
that
has
baffled
researchers
the
national
weather
service
said
ocean
levels
rapidly
rose
in
boothbay
southport
and
bristol
in
a
matter
of
minutes
around
3
pm
on
oct
28
to
the
surprise
of
ocean
watchers
exactly
what
caused
the
rogue
waves
remains
unknown
the
cause
of
it
is
a
mystery
said
national
weather
service
meteorologist
john
jensenius
who
first
reported
the
waves
from
a
field
office
in
gray
maine
but
its
not
mysterious
that
it
happened
specialists
have
posed
a
variety
of
possible
explanations
saying
the
waves
could
have
been
caused
by
a
powerful
storm
squall
or
the
slumping
of
mountains
of
sediment
from
a
steep
canyon
in
the
ocean

a
sort
of
mini
tsunami
the
last
time
such
rogue
waves
appeared
in
maine
was
at
bass
harbor
in
1926
jensenius
said
the
occurrence
is
so
unusual
that
specialists
dont
have
a
name
for
the
phenomenon
thats
part
of
our
problem
he
said
a
similar
occurrence
in
florida
more
than
15
years
ago
continues
to
baffle
researchers
a
series
of
12
to
15foot
waves
hit
daytona
beach
on
july
3
1992
injuring
more
than
20
people
and
lifting
and
tossing
dozens
of
cars
jeff
list
an
oceanographer
at
the
us
geological
survey
at
woods
hole
said
he
and
other
researchers
studied
the
occurrence
but
no
one
has
been
able
to
pinpoint
the
cause
and
he
said
similarly
enormous
waves
appeared
once
on
the
great
lakes
could
such
a
wave
or
waves
enter
boston
harbor
or
even
engulf
the
massachusetts
coast
it
seems
a
little
unlikely
one
could
hit
boston
list
said
but
then
again
these
things
are
always
surprises
when
they
occur
a
squall
line
surge
which
occurs
when
fastmoving
storm
winds
sweep
over
water
that
is
traveling
the
same
speed
can
create
such
a
wave
the
speed
of
waves
is
directly
related
to
wind
speed
and
the
depth
of
the
ocean
at
any
given
point
list
and
other
specialists
said
such
an
occurrence
is
exceedingly
rare
but
when
it
occurs
you
get
this
interaction
that
causes
a
large
bulge
of
water
to
rise
up
jensenius
said
that
might
have
been
a
factor
last
week
when
a
major
storm
front
brought
rain
to
most
of
the
east
coast
particularly
southern
new
england
but
he
said
that
does
not
solve
the
mystery
adding
that
he
had
not
ruled
out
a
massive
land
slump
underwater
such
slumps
can
create
waves
that
may
be
classified
as
tsunamis
although
no
where
near
the
size
and
scale
of
the
tsunami
that
occurred
in
the
indian
ocean
in
2004
those
fastmoving
and
deadly
waves
were
caused
by
a
massive
earthquake
tsunamilike
waves
may
not
be
as
rare
on
the
east
coast
as
most
people
think
jensenius
referenced
a
2002
article
in
the
international
journal
of
the
tsunami
society
that
called
the
threat
of
tsunami
and
tsunamilike
waves
generated
in
the
atlantic
ocean
very
real
despite
a
general
impression
to
the
contrary
the
article
said
such
waves
appear
in
most
cases
to
be
the
result
of
slumping
or
landsliding
associated
with
earthquakes
or
with
wave
action
associated
with
strong
storms
explosive
decompression
of
underwater
methane
could
also
be
a
factor
jensenius
said
he
is
trying
to
gather
information
on
the
waves
that
hit
boothbay
harbor
adding
that
he
has
asked
local
businesses
such
as
banks
whether
the
event
might
have
been
recorded
on
security
videos
it
could
be
this
or
it
could
be
that
but
as
a
science
it
is
very
difficult
to
tie
it
down
he
said
of
the
waves
list
also
said
the
waves
could
have
been
triggered
by
the
same
conditions
that
cause
a
tsunami
including
a
breaking
glacier
rogue
waves
can
result
from
a
tsunami
traveling
through
the
ocean
that
breaks
down
into
numerous
waves
according
to
the
national
weather
service
no
earthquakes
or
seismic
activity
were
reported
in
the
area
when
the
boothbay
waves
appeared
list
noted
that
there
was
no
seismic
reading
when
the
daytona
waves
struck
tom
lippmann
an
oceanographer
in
the
marine
sciences
department
at
the
university
of
new
hampshire
said
he
also
suspected
that
the
maine
wave
was
a
squall
line
surge
the
national
weather
service
incorrectly
called
it
a
tide
surge
he
said
tides
in
the
gulf
of
maine
are
essentially
driven
by
celestial
bodies
pull
on
the
earths
water
he
said
theyre
very
well
predicted
and
very
well
known
residents
and
business
owners
in
boothbay
said
they
were
glad
the
phenomenon
didnt
happen
at
high
tide
when
it
might
have
caused
massive
flooding
and
more
extensive
damage
janice
newell
who
lives
nearby
in
head
of
the
harbor
told
the
local
newspaper
the
rushing
water
was
of
biblical
proportion
there
were
three
large
whirlpools
in
the
inner
harbor
up
to
within
a
foot
of
my
neighbors
wall
she
told
the
boothbay
register
it
was
beautiful
but
it
was
scary
elena
smith
a
waitress
and
partowner
of
mcseagulls
restaurant
overlooking
the
harbor
said
the
lateafternoon
lunch
crowd
sat
speechless
as
the
waters
rose
and
receded
she
was
stunned
to
see
the
normally
safe
and
placid
harbor
suddenly
run
like
rapids
some
residents
reported
seeing
massive
whirlpools
of
water
that
disappeared
leaving
clam
shells
and
seaweed
in
vortex
patterns
on
the
harbor
floor
it
felt
like
somebody
took
the
plug
out
somewhere

democratical
presidential
candidate
joe
biden
blasted
john
mccain
over
the
weekend
for
voting
against
raising
the
minimum
wage
said
an
item
last
month
at
the
dallas
morning
news
website
since
the
posting
was
timestamped
5
am
that
democratical
may
well
have
been
a
slip
of
the
sleepdeprived
brain
the
writers
fingers
stretching
for
the
next
word

presidential

before
he
had
finished
the
first
its
not
the
first
time
in
recent
history
the
typo
has
seen
the
light
of
day
theres
an
example
in
a
2004
commentary
at
the
chattanoogans
website
like
barack
obama
said
in
his
democratical
national
convention
address
we
are
one
people

and
in
1992
the
atlanta
constitution
seems
to
have
endorsed
democratical
presidential
nominee
bill
clinton
a
few
decades
earlier
though
that
democratical
wouldnt
have
raised
an
eyebrow
david
k
barnhart
who
posted
the
dallas
morning
news
citation
at
linguistlistorg
the
american
dialect
societys
discussion
list
noted
that
the
oxford
english
dictionary
has
examples
of
the
adjective
from
the
mid16th
to
the
mid18th
century
as
an
everyday
variant
of
democratic
a
1589
religious
tract
for
example
says
the
english
church
is
monarchical
in
regard
of
our
head
christ
aristocratical
in
the
eldership
and
democratical
in
the
people
and
america
proved
just
as
hospitable
to
the
long
form
of
the
adjective
aristotle
and
other
grecian
political
writers
recognized
but
three
species
of
government
the
monarchical
the
aristocratical
and
the
democratical
wrote
a
contributor
to
the
american
whig
review
in
1847
with
the
adjective
already
in
circulation
its
only
natural
that
the
democratic
partys
members
and
sympathizers
would
now
and
then
be
called
democratical
as
in
an
1856
essay
on
political
loyalty
in
the
national
era
we
leave
to
democratical
newspaperwriters
to
go
through
thick
and
thin
for
the
party

unlike
todays
democrat
party
democratical
doesnt
seem
to
have
been
a
term
of
abuse
in
1873
the
nation
mentioned
the
extreme
democratical
party
in
1908
the
newark
ohio
advocate
reported
that
the
democratical
congressional
convention
of
the
seventeenth
district
opened
auspiciously
that
could
of
course
be
the
same
sort
of
slip
as
democratical
presidential
in
1924
the
mexia
daily
news
in
texas
complained
that
fundamentalists
call
the
liberal
antichrist
and
old
fogey
republican
calls
the
democratical
and
the
progressive
red
but
democratical
gradually
faded
away
when
exactly
it
began
to
sound
odd
is
hard
to
say
reporting
that
a
local
worthy
had
resigned
from
the
democratical
committee
might
have
been
standard
usage
at
the
statesville
nc
standard
in
1947
but
when
in
1960
the
chicago
tribune
called
kennedy
the
democratical
presidential
nominee
the
adjective
was
more
likely
a
typists
anticipatory
slip
as
it
is
today
democratical
wasnt
the
only
alternative
name
for
the
party
during
its
early
years
as
the
19th
century
wore
on
it
was
often
called
simply
and
warmly
the
democracy
with
or
without
a
capital
letter
the
oed
quotes
the
new
york
herald
in
1848
the
election
of
1840
was
carried
by
false
charges
against
the
american
democracy
at
the
democratic
national
convention
of
1852
several
state
delegations
used
the
name
for
their
party
the
democracy
of
pennsylvania
hold
principles
higher
than
all
other
considerations
even
in
the
20th
century
the
democracy
persisted
for
a
while
linguist
geoff
nunberg
in
an
essay
broadcast
on
fresh
air
quoted
william
jennings
bryan
addressing
a
party
gathering
in
boston
in
1902
i
recognize



how
much
fidelity
it
requires
to
plead
for
democracy
in
new
england
but
by
then
the
nickname
was
nearing
the
end
of
its
run
ambrose
bierce
sneered
at
it
in
his
1909
usage
handbook

one
could
as
properly
call
the
christian
church
the
christianity


but
he
was
beating
a
nearly
dead
horse
the
opposition
was
about
to
launch
its
own
nickname
the
one
we
still
hear
today
in
president
bushs
references
to
the
democrat
party
nunberg
traced
the
usage
to
1923
when
the
republican
speaker
of
the
new
york
assembly
called
the
opposition
the
democrat
party
hoover
used
it
as
well
in
1932
in
his
campaign
against
franklin
roosevelt
there
are
earlier
instances
of
the
phrase
noted
nunberg
but
it
seems
to
have
been
regarded
more
as
a
rusticism
than
as
a
partisan
dig
in
1908
a
wag
used
it
in
a
poem
accusing
william
jennings
bryan
of
being
a
flipflopper
nothin
at
all
to
say
william
nothin
at
all
to
say
there
aint
no
democrat
party
so
go
on
and
have
your
way
democrats
today
are
still
annoyed
by
democrat
party
especially
those
who
remember
it
as
a
favorite
epithet
of
senator
joseph
mccarthy
but
slurs
dont
always
work
as
intended
and
the
republican
overuse
of
democrat
party
may
actually
be
neutralizing
its
sting
pronounced
with
a
texas
twang
especially
its
beginning
to
sound
lke
a
rusticism
all
over
again

an

of
the

spring
blooms
in
the
white
of
winter
you
can
make
it
happen
and
heres
how
if
you
havent
gotten
to
plant
your
spring
bulbs
yet
keep
a
few
out
if
youve
planted
them
by
all
means
go
buy
a
few
more
theyre
starting
to
hit
the
sale
racks
the
easiest
to
force
are
daffodils
narcissus
tulips
hyacinths
or
crocus
the
best
ones
to
force
are
the
earlierseason
varieties
the
later
the
variety
the
taller
it
typically
tends
to
grow
when
you
are
forcing
bulbs
indoors
taller
often
means
topheavy
or
tipping
over
the
whole
idea
is
to
fool
the
bulb
into
thinking
it
has
actually
spent
its
required
number
of
days
in
the
frozen
garden
plan
on
this
part
taking
a
good
13
to
18
weeks
depending
on
the
species
during
this
time
the
bulbs
will
be
developing
their
root
system
so
you
wont
see
much
if
any
green
top
growth
once
the
recommended
cold
period
has
been
reached
you
can
bring
the
bulbs
indoors
the
warmth
will
trick
the
bulb
into
thinking
spring
has
sprung
and
within
the
first
week
you
will
begin
to
see
green
within
10
to
14
more
days
you
should
have
color
so
how
exactly
does
all
this
happen
for
starters
get
the
calendar
out
and
count
backward
from
the
date
youd
like
to
have
the
bulbs
in
bloom
for
example
hyacinths
require
a
minimum
of
13
weeks
of
cold
treatment
then
two
more
weeks
or
so
of
warmth
before
they
bloom
so
figure
on
15
weeks
from
planting
time
next
step
pick
a
pot
with
drainage
holes
and
fill
it
about
23
full
with
a
potting
mix
steer
clear
of
potting
soil
as
it
tends
not
to
provide
ample
drainage
set
the
bulb
pointed
end
up
basal
end
down
and
flat
side
facing
toward
the
rim
of
the
pot
so
the
first
leaf
that
grows
will
grow
out
over
the
rim
of
the
pot
it
just
looks
nicer
this
way
then
cover
with
soil
just
over
the
bulb
tip
water
well
if
planting
numerous
pots
be
sure
to
tag
each
pot
with
the
name
of
the
bulbs
and
the
date
planted
move
the
pots
to
a
spot
that
wont
freeze
but
where
the
temperature
will
hover
around
35
degrees
some
ideas
are
a
garage
old
refrigerator
or
unheated
basement
ive
had
good
luck
under
the
stairs
of
our
bilco
door
its
below
ground
and
mouseproof
once
theyre
in
the
cold
treatment
do
not
water
until
the
calendar
says
its
ok
to
bring
them
indoors
if
you
are
planting
multiple
pots
of
the
same
bulbs
and
would
like
to
extend
the
bloom
period
stagger
moving
them
in
by
intervals
of
5
to
7
days
when
the
time
arrives
bring
them
indoors
and
place
them
in
a
bright
location
dont
put
them
directly
in
a
south

or
west

facing
window
though
the
heat
on
a
sunny
day
can
become
too
intense
tulips
and
paperwhite
narcissus
sadly
are
best
tossed
after
theyve
bloomed
the
others
can
be
saved
and
planted
in
the
garden
come
spring
they
wont
rebloom
the
same
spring
but
should
within
12
years
once
daffodils
narcissus
hyacinths
and
crocus
have
bloomed
cut
the
flower
stalk
off
leaving
only
the
leaves
and
let
the
foliage
die
naturally
keep
watered
as
you
would
any
other
houseplant
to
prevent
drying
out
and
wait
until
the
soil
outdoors
thaws
then
plant
so
they
can
take
advantage
of
the
upcoming
growing
season
to
replenish
their
stored
food
supply
for
next
springs
bloom
mix
in
some
bonemeal
both
spring
and
fall
as
mentioned
each
species
requires
its
own
cooling

yes
you
read
it
right
paperwhites
do
not
require
precooling
and
will
bloom
about
35
weeks
after
planting
unless
you
already
have
planted
these
the
chances
for
a
thanksgiving
bloom
are
slim
but
timing
for
christmas
is
on
schedule
paperwhites
are
typically
planted
in
a
container
filled
with
small
stones
or
bark
chips
and
water
gently
wiggle
the
bulbs
into
the
stones

keeping
only
the
roots
not
the
entire
bulb
in
contact
with
water

and
place
in
bright
light
you
can
plant
the
other
bulbs
in
stones
rather
than
potting
mix
and
then
force

ask
chef
jos
andrs
to
describe
the
flavor
of
spain
and
he
erupts
in
an
impromptu
ode
to
his
homeland
spanish
food
will
taste
like
the
beautiful
smell
of
the
seaside
when
the
water
is
heating
the
rocks
and
you
have
this
perfume
of
sea
salt
spain
will
taste
like
that
says
the
restaurateur
and
host
of
pbss
made
in
spain
but
hes
just
getting
started
i
could
even
argue
that
spain
would
smell
not
like
heavy
smoke
but
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
forest
with
the
humidity
and
a
touch
of
smoke
in
the
air
andrs
muses
as
he
shops
the
penn
quarter
farmers
market
in
washington
dc
for
his
restaurant
minibar
and
i
would
say
it
smells
of
history
like
beautiful
old
cookbooks
despite
its
integral
role
in
the
early
history
of
the
new
world
remember
the
niãa
the
pinta
and
the
santa
maria
spain
for
many
americans
might
as
well
be
an
undiscovered
country
andrs
aims
to
change
that
he
currently
shares
the
pbs
schedule
with
mario
batali
bestknown
for
his
italianthemed

television
shows
batalis
spain

on
the
road
again
pairs
him
with
oscar
winner
gwyneth
paltrow
new
york
times
writer
mark
bittman
and
spanish
actress
claudia
bassols
as
they
gallivant
around
the
iberian
peninsula
drinking
eating
and
looking
beautiful
the
women
anyway
although
they
both
celebrate
the
foods
of
the
iberian
peninsula
the
shows
differ
in
tone
the
batalipaltrow
show
feels
a
little
like
hanging
out
with
the
popular
kids
in
high
school
except
the
bus
is
a
mercedes
benz
and
the
cafeteria
is
a
galician
vineyard
lest
the
viewer
think
this
is
a
beautifully
filmed
exercise
in
vanity
both
batali
and
paltrow
lived
in
spain
as
teenagers
and
their
return
road
trip
is
a
homecoming
of
sorts
their
delight
along
with
bittmans
role
as
resident
gruãon
grouch
and
bassols
gusto
tempers
the
feeling
that
the
viewer
has
intruded
on
an
exclusive
vacation
its
tempting
to
set
up
a
rivalry
between
the
two
shows
but
neither
host
will
bite
in
fact
batali
celebrated
his
birthday
at
andrs
sixseat
minibar
recently
jos
has
the
passion
and
the
ability
to
translate
to
the
home
cook
in
his
show
says
batali
by
cell
phone
from
an
airport
on
his
way
to
play
golf
with
tiger
woods

seriously
both
of
them
are
going
to
succeed
andrs
the
spaniard
agrees
but
makes
it
clear
that
he
got
there
first
my
show
started
airing
in
february
says
andrs
who
spent
nearly
three
years
shooting
his
show
which
is
in
its
second
season
now
we
were
in
different
seasons
waiting
for
saffron
to
open
waiting
for
the
tuna
to
come
or
for
the
harvest
of
olive
oil
probably
for
a
cooking
show
we
were
very
ambitious
ambition
and
a
sincere
desire
to
share
his
native
cuisine
has
propelled
andrs
career
since
he
crossed
the
atlantic
19
years
ago
to
work
in
new
york
after
a
stint
with
the
famed
innovator
ferran
adri
at
elbulli
in
northeastern
spain
with
a
successful
television
career
in
spain
five
restaurants
in
washington
dc
and
the
bazaar
in
the
new
sls
hotel
opening
in
beverly
hills
calif
this
month
andrs
still
has
a
sense
of
mission
about
his
work
my
wife
said
you
can
go
to
spain
and
be
a
tv
boy
or
go
to
america
and
use
tv
to
spread
your
message
its
the
ultimate
way
to
tell
the
story
of
my
country
through
cooking
and
not
only
in
the
kitchen
its
about
how
powerful
spanish
gastronomy
is
town

town
product
by

what
i
wanted
to
do
was
to
plant
the
seeds
and
make
people
want
to
know
more
both
shows
aim
to
pique
viewers
interest
in
traveling
to
spain
as
they
are
sponsored
in
part
by
the
spanish
tourism
office
and
theyre
sure
to
stimulate
interest
in
exploring
spanish
flavors
here
at
home
something
about
the
landscape
inspires
the
poet
in
batali
too
things
that
grow
together
go
together
he
says
as
he
grills
rosemary
and
lavenderseasoned
lamb
chops
over
grapevine
clippings
at
valdubn
vineyard
in
one
episode
everything
about
this
whole
dinner
is
from
250
yards
from
here
that
is
poetry
on
the
planet
batali
bestknown
for
his
italian
repertoire
says
spanish
food
shares
the
regions
cultural
and
geographic
roots
its
similar
in
its
mediterraneanness
to
italian
greek
and
southern
french
food
they
just

rice
more
than

the
result
especially
in
lincolns
darkest
year
is
a
cataloging
of
this
material
the
information
is
interesting
but
theres
too
much
of
it
with
few
guideposts
to
shape
the
civil
war
story
of
1862
into
a
cohesive
story
the
book
seems
aimed
at
other
historians
more
than
to
the
general
reader
marvel
is
a
fine
researcher
and
craftsman
but
he
is
no
david
mccullough
anyone
who
read
mcculloughs
fine
1776
about
the
start
of
the
american
revolution
can
appreciate
good
storytelling
mccullough
knows
how
to
use
strong
characters
and
actions
to
guide
readers
to
an
advanced
understanding
of
everything
at
stake
in
wartime
that
aspect
is
missing
in
lincolns
darkest
year
even
lincoln
comes
off
as
a
stick
figure
as
he
weighs
whether
to
issue
the
emancipation
proclamation
while
trying
to
determine
which
generals
to
trust
and
whether
to
intervene
in
military
matters
union
generals
especially
gen
george
mcclellan
with
his
constant
indecision
in
the
field
frustrated
lincoln
but
theres
little
sense
of
the
drama
that
must
have
played
out
in
the
white
house
marvel
delivers
much
new
material
especially
about
the
recruitment
of
union
soldiers
and
the
sad
plight
of
military
horses
but
he
doesnt
connect
those
to
the
overall
story
the
battles
of
antietam
and
fredericksburg
both
resulting
in
massive
casualties
are
described
in
detail
the
reader
ought
to
be
able
to
hear
the
roar
of
the
battle
and
see
men
falling
to
cannon
and
rifle
fire
but
marvel
concentrating
on
maneuvers
misses
the
drama

cookbooks
can
be

the

sensible

food
sense

go

and
see
people
scooping
up
carrots
labeled
organic

peeling

hopkinson
first
became
famous
as
the
opening
chef
for
bibendum
a
top
restaurant
in
britains
culinary
awakening
of
the
1990s
and
one
of
the
first
to
serve
refined
versions
of
english
rather
than
continental
food
when
the
restaurant
opened
in
1987
his
inclusion
of
the
prosaic
fish
and
chips
on
the
menu
caused
an
absolute
sensation
said
rowley
leigh
chef
at
le
cafe
anglais
in
london
april
bloomfield
the
chef
at
the
spotted
pig
in
the
west
village
cooked
under
him
at
bibendum
simon
was
really
convinced
that
you
should
cook
things
that
you
love
not
things
that
are
fancy
or
that
customers
expect
to
see
on
the
menu
of
a
certain
kind
of
restaurant
she
said
everything
he
made
he
made
perfectly
for
the
record
hopkinson
denies
being
a
perfectionist
what
is
all
the
sieving
and
straining
for
he
asked
during
a
discussion
of
cream
soups
all
this
striving
after
perfection
and
to
what
end
however
he
is
driven
nearly
mad
by
carelessly
peeled
potatoes
badly
washed
lettuce
and
what
he
views
as
mindless
innovation
why
on
earth
would
anyone
put
cumin
in
mint
sauce
for
lamb
or
a
caesar
dressing
on
bibb
lettuce
he
asked
wincing
in
genuine
pain
theres
no
reason
for
it
hopkinson
began
cooking
professionally
at
the
age
of
16
not
out
of
financial
necessity
or
on
a
whim
but
he
says
because
his
parents
simply
couldnt
keep
him
out
of
the
kitchen
any
longer
like
many
chefs
he
seems
to
have
total
food
recall
remembering
almost
every
dish
to
come
out
of
his
mothers
kitchen
in
the
1960s
wellmade
british
classics
and
french
party
food
with
some
daring
provencal
experiments
when
the
writer
elizabeth
david
began
to
nudge
the
cool
dairyloving
british
palate
to
explore
the
garlicrich
environment
of
the
mediterranean
he
began
his
career
in
a
firmly
french
kitchen
in
the
firmly
british
town
of
birtle
opened
his
own
french
restaurant
in
wales
in
1975
one
month
before
his
21st
birthday
and
in
1983
opened
the
french
restaurant
in
london
hilaire
that
began
to
make
his
reputation
for
grace
and
precision
unlike
many
british
chefs
i
never
felt
the
need
to
work
in
france
he
said
my
country
needed
me
he
was
born
in
1954
into
a
nation
renowned
as
a
gastronomic
wasteland
of
overcooked
vegetables
insipid
sauces
and
babyfood
textures
but
hopkinson
is
a
sentimental
cook
nostalgic
even
for
muchreviled
school
food
the
mince
at
my
school
wasnt
half
bad
you
know
he
said
not
to
be
confused
with
mincemeat
mince
is
a
kind
of
english
sloppy
joe
without
the
bun
in
hopkinsons
hands
ground
beef
is
cooked
down
with
onions
carrots
mushrooms
tomatoes
and
spices
into
a
savory
tangy
delicious
slop
like
many
chefs
who
now
describe
their
food
as
modern
british
hopkinson
has
had
to
dig
deep
to
find
truly
british
recipes
simon
will
make
apple

a

a
pretty
dull
and

for
eggs
or
cornstarch
to
make
it
set
chapters
on
brains
butter
and
dripping
suet
kidneys

reflect
his
conviction
that
traditional
british
cooking
before
being
mucked
up
by
ignorant
enthusiasms
for
extra
virgin
olive
oil
and
chili
peppers
could
hold
its

high

hopkinson
has
loosened
up
since
the
first
roast
chicken
book
and
now
digs
his
fangs
into
lazy
home
cooks
showoff
restaurant
chefs
and
knowitall
food
writers
with
equal
energy
something
seems
ever
so
slightly
wrong
in
the
state
of
the
home
kitchen
just
now
he
writes
we
watch
endless
cooking
shows
but
prefer
finally
to
spend
lots
of
money
on
prepared
supermarket
meals
while
idly
turning
the
pages
of
spotlessly
clean
cookbooks
until
the

pings

admits
to
some
similar
habits
for
example
with

own
celebrated

havent
made

it

cacao
has

grew

from
so
highly
valued
a
product
with
the
help
of

they
eliminated

said
they

cacao

tomas
keme
a
swiss
chocolate
expert
who
consults
for
kallari
said
of
the
cacao
nacional
beans
its
the
same
taste
i
find
in
a
californian
cabernet
the
chocolate
is
smooth
rich
and
straightforward
the
247ounce
bars
in
75
and
85
percent
cacao
sell
for
as
much
as
599
at
whole
foods
to
become
chocolatemakers
the
quechua
first
had
to
decide
to
be
more
than
just
farmers
but
they
didnt
have
the
knowledge
or
experience
we
wanted
change
said
carlos
pozo
kallaris
marketing
director
but
we
didnt
have
the
capital
or
anyone
who
would
trust
us
then
in
1997
they
met
judy
logback
a
lanky
kansan
with
wild
blond
hair
who
was
volunteering
for
a
foundation
promoting
biodiversity
in
ecuador
i
didnt
show
up
with
a
plan
logback
said
i
asked
them
what
they
wanted
pozo
and
others
said
they
wanted
to
sell
directly
at
markets
and
learn
how
to
grow
better
more
desirable
cacao
they
wanted
to
find
a
way
to
survive
and
thrive
as
they
faced
pressure
from
companies
that
sought
to
log
their
hardwood
trees
drill
on
their
land
for
oil
and
mine
for
gold
logback
first
helped
them
take
their
beans
more
than
250
miles
to
guayaquil
we
received
threats
that
the
intermediaries
would
rob
or
hijack
our
trucks
pozo
said
in
the
first
years
kallari
was
so
united
that
the
intermediaries
realized
they
could
not
break
through
this
union
they
watched
their
profits
from
cacao
more
than
double
as
they
got
48
cents
a
pound
in
guayaquil
four
years
later
they
established
kallari
which
in
quechua
means
both
to
begin
and
the
early
times
the
name
seemed
fitting
pozo
said
in
the
present
we
are
valuing
our
past
with
logbacks
help
the
cooperative
now
includes
about
850
families
judy
really
sacrificed
a
lot
for
us
said
elias
alvarado
kallaris
director
of
production
and
natural
resources
the
people
in
the
communities
really
love
her
for
what
she
has
done
as
their
confidence
grew
they
decided
to
sell
their
cacao
directly
to
big
league
chocolatemakers
they
emailed
makers
in
north
america
attracting
the
interest
of
robert
steinberg
a
founder
of
scharffen
berger
chocolate
in
berkeley
calif
but
steinberg
said
that
before
he
could
use
the
beans
they
needed
to
be
properly
fermented
a
process
that
brings
out
fruit
and
floral
flavors
and
reduces
astringency
logback
hired
jorge
ruiz
who
had
worked
for
a
cacao
cooperative
on
the
coast
to
teach
the
quechua
fermentation
before
his
arrival
the
quechua
had
only
fermented
their
beans
inadvertently
when
they
piled
them
up
before
drying
ruiz
taught
them
to
create
fermentation
boxes
and
to
monitor
temperatures
in
october
2004
steinberg
made
a
chocolate
bar
with
kallari
beans
and
helped
them
present
it
at
the
terra
madre
conference
of
the
slow
food
group
in
turin
italy
later
that
year
they
met
officials
from
the
swiss
chocolate
company
felchlin
who
agreed
to
pay
them
94
cents
a
pound
for
their
beans
inspired
by
their
success
logback
and
pozo
told
kallari
elders
that
they
should
start
making
chocolate
they
all
thought
we
were
crazy
pozo
said
we
dont
know
anything
about
this
market
what
kind
of
people
would
buy
it
how
to
make
it
chocolatemaking
has
always
been
less
common
in
cacaoproducing
countries
than
it
has
been
in
europe
where
the
technology
to
create
chocolate
bars
was
developed
and
where
such
a
luxury
could
be
more
easily
afforded
with
a
formula
from
steinberg
who
died
in
september
and
heavy
bushels
of

traveled
12
hours
by
bus
to

there

kallari
bars
i
was
confused
a
bit
by
what
i
believed
to
be
chocolate
said
alvarado
who
had
eaten
only
cheap
commercial
milk
chocolate
before
he
tried
the
kallari
bars
now
i
realize
after
all
these
years
that
i
was
eating
something
that
wasnt
really
chocolate
by
tasting
it
they
could
understand
their
role
in
the
finished
product
they
improved
their
farming
practices
and
bean
fermentation
over
500
families
received
organic
status
which
was
not
difficult
since
most
never
had
the
money
for
fertilizers
or
other
chemicals
it
was
difficult
though
to
perfect
their
chocolate
production
at
such
a
crude
facility
in
the
spring
of
2007
stephen
mcdonnell
the
founder
and
chief
executive
of
the
applegate
farms
organic
food
company
and
his
wife
jill
met
kallari
members
through
their
daughter
nora
who
visited
the
napo
region
with
her
seventhgrade
class
with
kallaris
permission
and
250000
mcdonnell
established
the
kallari
chocolate
co
which
lists
him
as
the
owner
for
liability
and
insurance
reasons
all
of
the
profits
though
go
back
to
the
kallari
cooperative
mcdonnell
hired
keme
to
teach
the
collective
about
bean
quality
and
techniques
of
swiss
chocolatemaking
he
also
hired
a
larger
more
efficient
chocolate
factory
in
quito
the
capital
of
ecuador
to
produce
the
bars
based
on
standards
set
by
keme
and
pozo
the
chocolate
made
in
salinas
less
refined
and
slightly
acidic
is
sold
in
some
health
food
stores
as
kallaris
sacha
bar
mcdonnell
asked
the
farmers
to
focus
on
their
farming
and
to
master
the
fermentation
of
their
beans
which
the
company
now
buys
from
kallari
for
as
much
as
195
a
pound
an
astronomical
price
for
the
average
cacao
farmer
cooperative
paradoxically
kallari
does
not
have
fair
trade
certification
since
it
would
cost
10
cents
per
pound
of
beans
and
it
seemed
unfair
for
kallari
to
pay
a
fee
for
its
own
beans
mcdonnell
has
taken
a
chance
but
he
says
he
is
not
concerned
the
kallari
people
have
pride
in
their
farms
he
said
and
are
transferring
that
pride
into
their
bar
plans
for
their
own
chocolate
factory
are
in
the
works
mcdonnell
hopes
that
within
three
to
five
years
a
board
of
kallari
directors
can
assume
most
of
his
duties
kallari
farmers
also
hope
to
diversify
to
continue
living
sustainably
off
their
land
they
are
planting
balsa
trees
which
grow
rapidly
to
sell
to
windmillmakers
and
they
want
to
promote
agritourism
there
was
a
dream
that
seemed
impossible
pozo
said
now
we
believe
there
are
so
many
possibilities
open
to
us
author
allia
zobel
nolan
hopes
her
latest
book
can
serve
as
a
tool
for
parents
caretakers
and
educators
who
are
looking
for
a
way
to
talk
with
children
about
diversity
since
the
world
is
such
a
diverse
place
and
small
children
get
to
mix
with
others
who
arent
like
they
are
at
a
very
young
age
i
think
its
important
for
parents
to
have
dialogues
with
their
children
explaining
that
people
come
in
all
shapes
and
sizes
colors
and
nationalities
she
says
adding
and
thats
a
good
thing
and
that
it
would
be
pretty
boring
if
we
all
looked
and
acted
the
same
nolan
released
one
special
me
a
book
celebrating
how
god
made
us
special
last
month
to
coincide
with
national
diversity
month
but
she
says
the
book
covers
an
issue
that
has
a
long
shelf
life
learning
to
appreciate
diversity
helps
us
in
all
phases
of
life
if
we
go
through
life
thinking
that
because
something
is
different
its
bad
we
arent
letting
ourselves
experience
the
exciting
interesting
and
intriguing
expansiveness
of
the
world
but
if
we
take
the
attitude
that
differences
are
what
makes
the
world
a
special
place
that
being
different
doesnt
make
anything
better
or
worse

it
just
makes
it
different

wed
all
get
along
a
better
she
says
she
also
believes
that
kind
of
attitude
would
encourage
people
to
seek
more
diverse
experiences
and
knock
down
barriers
that
never
had
to
exist
in
the
first
place
zobel
nolan
who
has
written
more
than
150
books
was
a
senior
editor
in
the
religious
books
department
of
readers
digest
childrens
publishing
in
pleasantville
ny
she
says
she
left
that
job
in
april
2007
to
concentrate
on
other
writing
projects
one
special
me
is
an
interactive
book
providing
young
readers
with
plenty
to
do
beyond
read
such
as
pull
at
flipup
flaps
and
spin
wheels
zobel
nolan
also
included
an
im
special
ribbon
that
children
can
wear
she
is
hopeful
one
special
me
with
illustrations
by
pauline
siewert
will
teach
younger
children
to
be
tolerant
and
accepting
of
themselves
and
others
i
want
them
to
learn
thats
its
ok
for
them
to
be
who
they
are

the
way
god
made
them

special

whether
its
short
or
tall
plump
or
thin
whether
they
have
red
hair
and
freckles
or
curly
hair
in
corn
rows
she
says
she
also
hopes
the
book
provides
the
lesson
or
at
least
provokes
discussion
that
it
also
is
ok
for
others
to
be
who
they
are
by
highlighting
that
no
two
people
are
alike
she
says
differences
would
be
celebrated
rather
than
mocked
children
and
adults
would
embrace
the
diversity
she
says
rather
than
shy
away
from
it
i
think
kids
feel
pressure
to
fit
in
to
be
like
everyone
else
personally
i
think
that
does
a
child
a
disservice
because
we
dont
want
to
raise
a
generation
of
clones

we
want
our
children
to
be
themselves

to
establish
their
own
identities
and
personalities
we
want
them
to
be
the
best
person
they
can
be
whatever
that
is
not
a
bad
imitation
of
someone
else
supreme
court
justices
spent
an
hour
tuesday
discussing
dirty
words
without
uttering
a
single
one
or
revealing
any
clues
about
whether
they
would
back
a
government
crackdown
on
broadcasters
who
aired
the
expletives
at
issue
is
the
validity
of
the
federal
communications
commissions
2004
decision
to
stop
tolerating
the
onetime
fleeting
use
of
dirty
words
on
air
and
instead
begin
punishing
broadcasters
who
dont
bleep
the
expletives
during
live
shows
the
fcc
adopted
its
policy
to
consider
fines
beginning
at
325000
for
what
the
broadcast
industry
and
the
commission
call
fleeting
expletives
after
celebrities
cursed
during
the
live
broadcasts
of
2003
golden
globes
awards
ceremony
and
the
2002
and
2003
billboard
music
awards
during
one
of
the
broadcasts
singer
bono
said
onair
that
it
was
really
fing
brilliant
to
get
an
award
during
another
show
celebrity
nicole
richie
said
it
was
not
so
fing
simple



to
get
cow
s
out
of
a
prada
purse
fox
television
stations
and
other
broadcasters
successfully
challenged
the
new
policy
before
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit
which
ruled
last
year
that
the
fccs
change
had
been
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
therefore
violated
federal
law
the
fcc
appealed
to
the
high
court
during
oral
arguments
tuesday
lawyers
and
justices
inside
the
supreme
court
repeatedly
relied
on
the
euphemisms
of
the
sword
and
the
fword
but
carefully
avoided
their
colorful
originals
the
expletives
have
shocking
value
noted
chief
justice
john
roberts
the
words
are
associated
with
sexual
or
excretory
activity
he
said
thats
what
gives
them
force
associate
justice
antonin
scalia
complained
about
a
coarsening
of
society
and
said
fox
and
other
broadcasters
had
something
to
do
with
that
other
justices
signaled
they
were
more
comfortable
with
the
occasional
swear
word
sometimes
they
can
be
used
in
a
way
that
is
really
hilarious
very
very
funny
and
you
cant
help
but
laugh
noted
justice
john
paul
stevens
associate
justice
stephen
breyer
observed
that
you
deal
with
a
crosssection
of
humanity
at
sporting
events
and
on
televised
awards
shows
and
my
experience
is
some
parts
of
that
crosssection
swear
the
case
also
involves
the
first
amendments
right
to
free
speech

and
the
constitutionality
of
the
fccs
power
to
police
the
airwaves
the
court
has
invalidated
government
indecency
regulations
for
cable
television
and
the
internet
limiting
the
fccs
power
to
the
public
airwaves
referring
to
the
first
amendment
application
to
the
fcc
case
associate
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
said
it
was
the
big
elephant
in
the
room
one
possible
outcome
in
the
appeal
is
that
the
justices
would
send
the
case
back
to
a
lower
court
to
consider
the
broader
constitutional
question
of
whether
fcc
regulation
runs
afoul
of
the
first
amendment
us
solicitor
general
gregory
garre
urged
the
justices
to
support
the
commission
saying
its
decision
to
go
after
fleeting
expletives
was
reasoned
and
rational
garre
warned
that
if
unchecked
and
unregulated
networks
would
be
free
to
use
expletives

americans
who
want
to
get

can
go
to

garre
said
broadcast
television
is
the
one
place
where
americans
can
turn
on
the
tv
at
8
oclock
and
watch
their
dinner
and
not
be
expected
to
be
bombarded
with
indecent
language
either
in
an
isolated
basis
or
a
repeated
basis
carter
phillips
the
attorney
representing
fox
said
that
unlike
other
government
actions
the
fcc
isnt
regulating
the
price
of
oil
in
a
pipeline
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
said
you
are
regulating
the
content
of
speech

and
the
fccs
decisions
to
pursue
fleeting
expletives
have
a
chilling
effect
on
broadcasters
although
some
broadcasters
briefly
delay
live
sporting
events
and
awards
shows
so
they
have
time
to
bleep
out
any
vulgarities
phillips
said
the
cost
of
tapedelay
systems

and
the
employees
needed
to
man
them

may
be
prohibitive
for
smaller
stations
rather
than
risk
airing
an
expletive
and
getting
penalized
by
the
fcc
smaller
stations
may
opt
against
broadcasting
local
sporting
events
or
political
debates
altogether
phillips
said
in
determining
whether
to
punish
broadcasters
the
fivemember
fcc
considers
the
context
surrounding
indecencies
and
evaluates
whether
that
violates
prevailing
community
standards
ginsburg
complained
that
the
contextbased
decisions
can
be
capricious
she
cited
the
fccs
decision
not
to
rap
broadcasters
for
airing
the
war
movie
saving
private
ryan
despite
expletives
in
the
film
there
seems
to
be
no
rhyme
or
reason
when
the
commission
says
that
one
of
these
words
is
okay
and
when
it
says
it
isnt
a
decision
in
the
case
is
expected
