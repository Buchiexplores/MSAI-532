Google's Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) architecture system works like a well-coordinated team of networks, 
breaking down the translation process into three key parts: the encoder, attention module, and decoder. 
The encoder LSTM layers, running on multiple GPUs, help the model understand the meaning of the input sentence by converting words into numbers. 
The attention module ensures that the model focuses on the right words at the right time, rather than translating blindly.
Finally, the decoder LSTM generates the translated sentence step by step, using Softmax to choose the best words. 
This entire process makes translations faster, smoother, and more accurate, producing natural and fluent results instead of awkward, word-for-word conversions.
